the ultimate crowdfunding guide about us submit a tip – contact us search newest reg cf crowdfunding platform mr crowd has roots in hong kong tweet share share  reddit pin emailshares  september     pm by jd alois the list of approved and regulated regulation cf platforms is growing the roster now stands at  finra regulated crowdfunding platforms  the most recently approved platform ‘mr crowd’ has an interesting progeny as it is being launched by allen au and his ksdaq inc corporation while ksdaq is incorporated in the us the principal’s primary place of business is in hong kong in fact ksdaq hired the law firm of boase cohen  collins to provide a legal opinion as to why this was totally fine “investmentbased crowdfunding is revolutionary and we are eager to witness and participate in the growth of such an emerging market” crowdfund insider recently contacted ksdaqmr crowd to learn more about the launch of the crowdfunding platform we communicated with the founder chairman and ceo allen au who shared his vision for the platform au has over  years of it experience and in the financial industry au was a cofounder an executive director the chief technology officer   and the director of product development  of finet group limited a hong konglisted company stock symbol hk finet’s principal business is in the provision of financial information services and in the securities business in 4 au cofounded whoiask limited which is the parent company of ksdaq in preparation for launching an investment crowdfunding platform the interview with au is below crowdfund insider why did you decide to launch a reg cf portal in the us allen au in september  we decided to submit an application to financial conduct authority fca of uk as we planned to operate an equity crowdfunding portal there equity crowdfunding targeting retail investors is legal in uk since   however as you know the story the title iii of the jobs act was signed into legislation by president obama in october of that year after discussions with my partners  we decided to change our plan ie to operate our cf business in us due to the following reasons and considerations us is a way bigger market than uk population m vs m us people are more willing to accept new concepts and innovations great companies like google facebook apple… are from us but i can hardly name three from uk in fact if there was title iii in  zuckerberg would be very likely to raise funds from cf for facebook therefore we started the legal works and fp application process in january at the same time we modified our platform to ensure our “uk” platform to comply with the us cf rules after nearly six months of work with our team and attorneys our application was approved by finra and sec in august as we are not backed by any vcs or angel investors our operations are totally financed by our own funding it’s tough to go through the whole process luckily all of our founders have strong technical backgrounds and we are able to do the it works on our own without any outsourcing which has saved us a lot of costs crowdfund insider how did the sec receive your request how long did it take to receive approval allen au like other funding portals in the states we submitted our application to sec and finra however we are different from other funding portals because of our background since our parent company is headquartered in hong kong and all of our founders are from there as well we are required by sec to provide an opinion of counsel this is to ensure we are able to provide sec and finra with prompt access to our books and records and submit to onsite inspection and examination by sec and finra indeed we are the first and only one nonresident funding portal in us as of today because we are foreigners finra had more questionings on our eligibility especially on whether we are familiar with the us cf rules and whether our operations comply with aml related regulations the finra process lasted for two months including an interview with our management crowdfund insider is this the first step in a strategy to offer investment opportunities to asian investors  or perhaps to expand into other securities exemptions allen au yes the understanding of the asia including china market is our advantage  we seek to expand our geographic reach and enhance our presence in our crowdfunding business in the other places of the world by expanding to markets where crowdfunding are legal we are also actively seeking opportunities to market our platform in the international market we are also looking for opportunities to move into markets that are adjacent to where we operate so we can apply our skills and build our scale even further crowdfund insider what types of issuers are you looking to list how will you be sourcing these deals allen auwe don’t have specific preferences on the types of issuers  however we review and evaluate to ensure the eligibility of issuers the followings are the general guidelines when reviewing an issuer the issuer has a business operation history the issuer has an operating revenue for the most recent financial year the issuer must be in a healthy financial position with a debt to equity ratio of  or lower the directors  executive officers should have appropriate experience and expertise to manage the issuer’s business we source issuers via entrepreneurs’ esubmission of applications via mrcrowdcom our partners and networking in us social media incubation programmes to be launched in  to support young entrepreneurs mr crowd will operate a number of incubation programmes provide a range of business and professional services to assist young entrepreneurs and their companies in their inception stages and to encourage and promote innovationbased entrepreneurship by providing relevant assistance and support we will assist outstanding and wellperformed incubatees to raise funds at mr crowd if they are qualified to our fundraising requirements crowdfund insider when do you expect to start offering securities will you be offering debt  equity or both  allen au currently we have three issuers raising usk – k each these three issuers will launch their offerings in october when mr crowd launches officially  mr crowd will be focused on equitybased crowdfunding and has no intention to provide debtbased offerings in the near future crowdfund insider would you share your perspective on the hong kong – internet finance  crowdfunding ecosystem allen au in hong kong equitycrowdfunding is currently not allowed but to follow the trend of the world legislation is likely to change in the coming years in fact in china equitycrowdfunding is allowed and crowdfunding there is really hot for example alibaba launched its equity crowdfunding site antsdaqcom in october last year to prepare for the possible legislation change in the future we will launch a “sister” website in asia next year called mrs crowd httpsmrscrowdcom which will focus purely on rewardbased crowdfunding rewardbased cf is legal in hong kong mrs crowd the wife of mr crowd  will be a rewardproductbased crowdfunding portal for individuals and companies seeking to raise funds for their campaigns hong kong will be mrs crowd’s primary focus it is also a prelude for our equity crowdfunding business in asia rewardbased campaigns owners and backers in mrs crowd are likely to be the issuers and investors of the future asia version of mr crowd our equity crowdfunding vehicle sponsored links by dq promote you may also likereg cf
