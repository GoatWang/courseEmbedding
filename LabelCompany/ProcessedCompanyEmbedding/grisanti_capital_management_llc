intense research intense research concentrated portfolios intense research concentrated portfolios proven results  grisanti capital management why grisanti capital management   intense research concentrated portfolio our approach is to invest in only a few companies usually less than  after extensive research  we discard over  of the companies we investigate and then we hold our few concentrated investments for an average of three years  strong performance  by only owning a small number of companies and not the whole market we can invest where we think the value will be created over our three year investment horizon  that has led to outperformance over the market sinceinception in   experience and ownership  our five investment professionals have an average of over  years on wall street  chris grisanti founded the firm in  and used his own equity to buy out his two partners in   client focused  we manage separate accounts for each client because the needs of one wealthy family endowment or institution may be different from those of another  we are accessible responsive and most importantly able to tailor an account to your individual needs and goals our philosophy  some managers emphasize good returns others a relationship you can count on  we believe that trust and performance should both be part of the investment management relationship  you ought to know how you are doing from quarter to quarter and we will be transparent about your investments just read our quarterly letters for an example  open communication creates trust and trust itself can lead to better performance over the long term because its presence means we can take long term contrarian investments that by their very nature are out of favor and disliked when we buy them  your trust helps avoid emotional reactions that lead to poor returns  our goal is to succeed by making you money over the long term in as safe a way as possible  we want to earn your trust by managing your money intelligently explaining what we are doing and being responsive to your needs   contact us about us about grisanti history our team contact us large cap value portfolio philosophy  process past

reading what makes grisanti capital management different since our founding in  grisanti capital management has delivered strong valueoriented investment performance for individuals families and institutions such as foundations endowments and pension funds value focus for the past  years we have focused intently on investing in companies that are neglected or even despised by the market these outoffavor companies can produce excellent returns  as they regain the market’s good graces financial companies in  oil refiners in  and technology firms after the tech bubble burst in  are prime examples of successful value investments we have made over our history research  concentration our intensive research leads us to develop concentrated portfolios that include  stocks we typically reject more than  of the securities we initially examine over the years we’ve found this concentration produces strong results that differ from a more indexlike portfolio we report in detail to our clients each quarter and share our research and investment goals client focus from our inception grisanti capital management realizes that a small firm like ours must differentiate itself by providing sophisticated custom service to our clients many of our clients have come to us after being treated to an impersonal “asset allocation” test at large wall street firms you’ll find that we tailor our services to meet your needs and investment strategy you won’t deal with a sales person – you will work directly with a professional that is working with you to create a longterm investment plan independent ownership chris grisanti cofounded the firm at the end of  he bought out his two partners using his own capital currently he is the sole owner of the firm and is committed to its growth

management gcm we strive to create longterm capital appreciation by assembling a concentrated portfolio of  highquality and undervalued common stocks  we believe our focus on valuation helps to limit the risk of the portfolio the companies in the portfolio are predominantly large cap holdings  with no one position exceeding  at the time of purchase  our portfolio is not indexdriven and does not mimic benchmarks which is the primary reason for gcm’s longterm record of outperformance we want to own quality businesses that generate superior returns and cash flows via modest debt leverage   we utilize two different methodologies to identify such opportunities  one is cash flow at a discount which focuses on earnings or other measures of cash flow that the company will produce in the future to justify a higher share price  a second feature we look for are assets at discount  here we try to identify those companies whose current assets exceed the value of their share price  this places less emphasis on future growth and more on current value  we believe our disciplined and repeatable investment process unearths deeply undervalued securities leading to superior riskadjusted returns over the long haul as with any business we think success begins with great leaders  we look for businesses that have a history of shareholder friendly capital allocation and a management whose longterm goals are aligned with shareholders  tightly aligned shareholder and management interests reinforce our conviction level for common stocks added to the portfolio   contact us about us about

bloomberg tv this week discussing our contrarian attraction to the financial sector will baker hughes walk chris grisanti was quoted in a barron’s article about the baker hughes dilemma   will baker hughes walk by vito j racanelli april   the clock has begun ticking in earnest on whether the halliburton hal and baker hughes bhi merger will actually take place last wednesday both companies said they intended to “vigorously contest” the justice department antitrust lawsuit filed the same day blocking their proposed combination under the terms of the deal announced in november  when oilpatch conditions were much stronger either party can walk away from the deal after april   baker hughes stock jumped to  from  last week because it stands to get a  billion termination fee but the two companies face uncertain futures near term both are in nowin positions contesting the justice department lawsuit could take many more months in what has already been a long and contentious wait for the deal to close in the interim the oilservice business has been mauled by one of the worst downturns in its history and like the industry the two companies have suffered the courts could rule in favor of the deal or against it but either way with potential appeals it will require some time further dragging out a process that has taken too long already distracting and weakening both companies baker hughes stock rose last week because many investors believe the company will choose to walk and take the termination fee—one fifth of its market value—with it that’s a nice chunk of change but probably not enough to make up for the general disruption employee turnover and loss of focus and market share that baker hughes has endured it faces a long mending process postbreakup baker hughes will be on its heels as the company prepares to return to independent operations the shares of both companies could trade down in the short term if the deal officially breaks up baker hughes might find itself with its newfound cash but worse off in the longer term “it seems clear that this thing is over and that baker hughes will likely walk” says christopher grisanti a portfolio manager at grisanti capital management which sold its stakes in both companies in  there’s been speculation that general electric ge would step in and buy baker hughes but that’s a big bite even for a company the size of ge given the industry’s woes industry balance sheets are stressed and managers get punished for oilpatch mergers grisanti adds last year in “baker hughes blues” nov   we noted there was a less than  chance that the deal would clear regulatory hurdles and that baker hughes could fall another  to  its stock is down  since then we’re closing out this call and taking our chips home there’s too much uncertainty baker hughes and halliburton declined to comment it’s rarely a good idea to get involved with stocks when a single government decision can make or break it now it looks to be up to a judge if baker hughes doesn’t walk first   source wwwbarronscom url – httpwwwbarronscomarticleemailwillbakerhugheswalklmyqjamtimzezmtkxmtexwj march   chris grisanti was on bloomberg television
