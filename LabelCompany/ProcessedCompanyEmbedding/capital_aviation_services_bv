the hypothetical income the effective tax rate determined taking into consideration any personal income and the benefits described above this approach is intended to fairly allocate the benefit of the graduated tax structure and applicable deductions between the executive and chc     f during the year chc will withhold an estimated hypothetical tax from the executive’s compensation instead of the federal income tax withholdings which would have been applicable to his hypothetical income “estimated hypothetical tax amount” chc will be liable for and pay on the executive’s behalf all actual taxes due in the us and canada with respect to his hypothetical income      g the executive’s tax equalization calculation will be prepared by the tax professionals selected as specified in paragraph  above after completion of the executive’s us and foreign income tax returns this calculation is intended to reconcile any difference between the executive’s final hypothetical tax and the estimated

reimbursement from chc if the final hypothetical tax exceeds the estimated hypothetical tax chc shall be entitled to a reimbursement from the executive    expenses chc shall promptly reimburse the
