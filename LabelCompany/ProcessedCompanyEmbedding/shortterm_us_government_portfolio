driver of performance and benefited from rising rates on the short end of the yield curve as the securities coupons reset higher the funds investments in fixed rate agency cmos also aided performance during the period as these securities outperformed treasuries despite slight spread widening detractors  the funds investments in interest only agency mbs were a slight drag on performance despite slowing prepayment speeds during the quarter investment outlook and fund positioning  management believes that although the us economy remains on a solid footing the likelihood of tail risk events which could have a positive or negative impact on financial markets have increased due to the change in us political leadership and the gr owing geopolitical uncertainties against this backdrop management believes agency mbs remain an attractive investment opportunity as they provide investors with an attractive spread over treasuries without taking credit risk in the current low yield environment it is important not to reach for yield and be mindful of interestrate risk as such management believes agency mbs with minimal extension risk and more stable prepayment profiles remain extremely attractive in the current rate environment credit quality as of mar   aaa  bbb  bb  b  total  ratings are based on moodys sp or fitch as applicable if securities are rated differently by the
