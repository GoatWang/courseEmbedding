management systems vms in glendale california in  the pair decided early on that they would focus exclusively on one niche within the financial services industry and become masters of it their niche was automating mutual fundrelated backoffice processes for trust companies and recordkeepers at the time mutual funds were just coming into vogue and they were very problematic to deal with vms’s first client north american trust company in san diego needed a custombuilt recordkeeping system that was highly dependent on holding mutual funds that first job launched vms as a technology innovator and resulted in additional custom engagements over the next  years in the retirement and trust space with firms like charles schwab wells fargo and sei these engagements provided the knowledge for the creation of the mutual fund desk mfd and specialized information services sis products both products were built with a focus on full transparency and flexible integration that could be adapted to the various technological infrastructures and continually evolving rules and regulations in the financial services space this experience would prove timely when in  after reviewing the release of the pension protection act in congress bob and brad foresaw two fundamental market issues that would hinder the act’s effectiveness due to the current technology infrastructure in the retirement space regardless of the intent of the act participants would have limited choices when it came to investment selection and access to proper investment advice this was due to technology limitations and the inability of recordkeeping systems to perform securities processing like trust and brokerage systems do current recordkeeping systems fundamentally lacked the ability to hold cash as a form of property for individual participants this prevented them from being able to transparently account for participant expenses it also interfered with easily adding additional investment types to plans and prevented the ability to trade realtime during the business day when securities markets were open based on these insights brad and bob’s shared vision became to solve for the “ as” any participant in any retirement plan should be able to hire any investment advisor and that advisor should be able to buy the participant any investment at any time and in addition all participant expenses should be fully transparent this statement was not as much a definition for a new product as it was a design mission statement for the degree of openness a proper retirement servicing technology should deliver at this time vms began investing heavily into the creation of retirement revolution in  with a stable mfd and sis client base and the first release of a markettested retirement revolution product in production vms hired financial technology veterans kevin rafferty ceo and bob ward cro to help bring retirement revolution to the marketplace after experiencing continued success with a solid product set and bluechip client roster vms was ready for the next level of growth in  a search was conducted for a partner who would provide vms with the missing pieces to help complete their
