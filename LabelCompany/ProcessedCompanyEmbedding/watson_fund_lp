plantcommentarymastering datahas ibm watson’s ai technology fallen victim to hypebarb darrowjun  if you ask ibm about its plans for a given business opportunity—health care financial services pharma even sports coverage—the answer will likely center on watson ibms take on artificial intelligence or cognitive computing in ibm parlancesince beating human champions in jeopardy six years ago watson has been very long on promise and generated untold numbers of headlines as for real results as in profit and real new business its unclear as ibm ibm chief executive ginni rometty has said the company does not break that out in order to protect this crucial but nascent businessover the past year critics have voiced skepticism about watsons realworld prospects especially as ai competitors—from google goog to microsoft msft—have brought their ai software offerings to marketthe perception now is that watson has not met lofty expectationsrelated at the ripe age of  ibm seeks to reinvent itself—againthe most strident take down came last month when chamath palihapitiya chief executive and founder social capital a vc fund told cnbc that watson is a joke just to be completely honestthe companies that are advancing machine learning and ai dont brand it with some nominally specious name thats named after a sherlock holmes character he addedto be fair while ibm ibm did set the table for this broad brush branding other tech companies have taken up the cause with a vengeance sprinkling the term ai like fairy dust on every bit of their software ibm has watson while salesforce crm has einstein for examplerelatedmastering datawhatsapp says  billion people use its chat app every daymastering datawhatsapp says  billion people use its chat app every dayearly on some large companies that were interested in watson as portrayed by ibm privately noted later that while they saw great promise watson in reality was a set of technologies that needed to be stitched together at their site that meant buying watson—and then preparing data for watson—was more a big integration project than a product purchasethats good for ibms services business but these companies were not interested in taking on a such a task ibm duly set up business units centered on productizing the technology as david kenny who was then general manager of the watson business noted to fortune last year kenny is now senior vice president in charge of both watson and ibm cloud platformrelated ibm watson is all about ibm infrastructurea new article in mits tech review has an interesting take on all of this while it notes setbacks for watson in health care—notably md anderson cancer centers decision to walk away from watson earlier this year—the short take is dont throw out the baby with the bath waterthe author argues watson suffers from the ibms overthetop marketing but the tech is still valuable for health care applicationsrelated ibm watson health unit debutsaccording to tech review most of the issues with watson have nothing to do with a technological problem they are more about the availability and quality of data for watson to processit still seems likely that watson health will be a leader in applying ai to health care’s woes if watson has not as of yet accomplished a great deal along those lines one big reason is that it needs certain types of data to be “trained” and in many cases such data is in very short supply or difficult to access that’s not a problem unique to watson it’s a catch facing the entire field of machine learning for health careibm it notes has been aggressive in filling this data gap it paid  billion to buy truven health and its data trove last year for examplein response to the article an ibm spokeswoman told fortune that the watson ai platform has been trained on six types of cancer to date with plans to add eight more types this year and she noted its use many top life sciences companies along with companies building internet of things applications retailers and financial services firmsit would be hard for any serious person to conclude that watson is not working on some of the most significant issues in society today—and making progress she said via emailthe problem with ai as subject matter is that the companies behind it and journalists covering it guilty here fall into the trap of extolling the technology as the greatest or scariest ever and then the inevitable reality is just well underwhelmingrelated ibm watson not so elementary my former colleague derrick harris has great take on all this in his architecht newsletter read the whole thing but in his view the biggest issue for business people is falling for the hype without understanding whats happening in the technology right now he thinks the
