time of the year good luck navigating the traffic biggest news of the week was the change of mind by the saudi’s to cut production now will opec fall in line saudi arabia has ended its flirtation with free oil markets it took the kingdom’s new oil minister khalid alfalih just six months to blink ending the country’s twoyear policy of pumpatwill the decision at this week’s meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries in algiers to cut production was necessitated by saudi arabia’s tattered finances the kingdom has the highest budget deficit among the world’s  biggest economies may delay its first international bond issue and now faces fresh legal uncertainty after the us congress voted wednesday to allow americans to sue the country for its involvement in  bloomberg   saudi arabia had to change its course as its country’s finances were getting sandblasted… saudi arabia has unveiled pay cuts for government employees for the first time as it attempts to further rein in spending at a time of low oil prices a royal decree said ministers’ salaries would be reduced by  and housing and car allowances for members of the advisory shura council cut by  lowerranking civil servants will see wage increases suspended and overtime payments and annual leave capped about twothirds of working saudis are employed in the public sector their salaries and allowances accounted for  of government spending in  or bn £bn and contributed to a record budget deficit of bn bbc   deutschebank also moved front and center last week the large us fine has increased worries about its capital ratios and large derivatives book here is the outcome that the market needs right now to settle down… best settlement scenario achieving a settlement with the doj is mr cryan’s top priority and he has been spending most of his time recently in the us trying to bring talks swiftly to a close if deutsche bank could settle the case for close to its bnbn target and complete the sale of its bn minority stake in china’s huaxia bank it could put a stop to swirling speculation about its weak capital position this should trigger a rebound in its share price which has slumped to threedecade lows and shore up client confidence in its financial position the bank could then present investors with a beefed up strategy to rebuild profitability and strengthen its balance

for this sector since q   the current record high since  is  which occurred in q  factset   as technology earnings surprise to the upside their stocks are following to make them the best sector performers for the q… another reason investors want tech stocks right now is that big safe cash cushion… factset here is the deep dive into the sector and asset classes for the q click to enlarge the pic for the notes prices as of  investors were betting against corporate debt in record numbers last month… bets that corporate bond prices will slide surged in the buildup to this month’s federal reserve meeting with short interest in the largest corporate bond exchange traded fund hitting a record level the bearish signal is a measure of investor sales of shares that they do not hold in a wager that the bond price will fall and they can repurchase it later at a lower price the increase in short interest could indicate that investors were seeking to hedge their exposure to corporate credit as they buy the underlying cash bonds several fund managers said it could also be a harbinger that investors expect markets to fall after a bumper rally this year us junkrated corporate paper has advanced  per cent this year outpacing the  per cent total return of the benchmark sp  stock index by contrast highquality company bonds have returned  per cent financial times …this explains why

affordability versus mortgage affordability… business insiderzillow i love oregon and know that they have a significant pension shortfall but a  sales tax on all oregon corporate revenues is not the answer this will only cause a raising of prices and cutting of wages for all oregon citizens shareholders in oregonbased companies will not stand by and absorb a  billion hit to their earnings and in the case of any publicly regulated utility they can’t it must be passed through to the consumer so all electric and gas bills immediately rise thereby hurting the citizens that can least afford it oregon voters in november will consider the largest us corporate tax increase in this millennium a decision that may make the state a proving ground for the liberal belief that businesses are getting a free ride the measure would levy a  percent tax on instate gross sales of more than  million it would swell oregon’s budget  percent and steer  billion of corporate earnings annually toward schools healthcare and the elderly making it something of a pacific northwest welfare state bloomberg   speaking of pension fund difficulties howard marks thinks that fiduciaries should plan on  annual gains
