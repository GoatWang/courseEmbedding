compiled under the editorial supervision of george thomas little a m litt d lewis historical publishing company new york  please see index page for full citation transcribed by coralynn brown many families included in these genealogical records had their beginnings in massachusetts bean the families of bean bain and bayne as the name is variously spelled are undoubtedly descended from the old scotch scottish clan vean the letters b and v in gaelic are interchangeable so that vean and bean are the same name differently spelled the origin of the name is a matter of conjecture by some it is claimed to be derived from the place of residence of the clan beann in gaelic signifying mountain but a better supported opinion is that it is derived from the fair complexion of the clans progenitor bean meaning white or fair and often used by highlanders to distinguish a man of fair complexion as olive black or swarthy was used to designate one of dark complexion the clan vean or as it is oftener designated in scotch scottish history macbean was one of the tribes of the chatli or clan chattan and occupied the lochaber territory some time before the year  three distinct families of this blood came to america  the bains settled in virginia the banes in maine and the beans in new hampshire in what year or on what ship the progenitor of the beans reached these shores is not and probably never will be known i john bean the immigrant ancestor originally macbean or bayne was a scotchman scotsman said to be the son of donald macbayne and born in scotland there is reason to believe that he was one of the scotch scots taken prisoner by cromwell at the battle of worcester or some of the other victories that he won over the royalist and scottish forces many thousand of these scots prisoners were sent over here and in time became proprietors and citizens in good standing with their english neighbors and many other scots were drawn to new england to follow relatives who had been

lewis wolff awarded beane a small portion of the teams ownership in february  the athletics extended beanes contract through  from their  playoff appearance until  when they again made the playoffs the athletics had not made the playoffs or finished above  which had triggered criticism of beane and his approach in some quarters in baseball especially in  beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach indicating that his philosophy revolves around research and analysis many other general managers have followed beanes strategy and now use similar approaches the book itself has changed the way different players are valued and beane began concentrating on high school players a group he once largely ignored in the mlb draft considering them to be heavily undervalued he and other likeminded gms also changed their draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills which had become undervalued in the years immediately after the moneyball revolution this new emphasis on defense was displayed in the  season although the athletics finished at  and again missed the playoffs they led mlb in defensive efficiency measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted in outs and allowed the fewest runs in the al in the  season the athletics again made the playoffs under beane winning the american league west title on the last day of the regular season the

league players under the ownership of walter a haas jr the athletics appeared in three consecutive world series from  through  and had the highest payroll in baseball in  haas died in  and new owners stephen schott and ken hofmann ordered alderson to slash payroll to field a competitive roster on a limited budget alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles to obtain relatively undervalued players he valued onbase percentage among hitters alderson taught beane to find value that other teams did not see using sabermetrics beane succeeded alderson as gm on october   he continued aldersons crafting of the athletics into one of the most costeffective teams in baseball for example in the  mlb season the athletics ranked th of  major league teams in player salaries but had the thbest

 the athletics extended beanes contract through  from their  playoff appearance until  when they again made the playoffs the athletics had not made the playoffs or finished above  which had triggered criticism of beane and his approach in some quarters in baseball especially in  beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach indicating that his philosophy revolves around research and analysis many other general managers have followed beanes strategy and now use similar approaches the book itself has changed the way different players are valued and beane began concentrating on high school players a group he once largely ignored in the mlb draft considering them to be heavily undervalued he and other likeminded gms also changed their draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills which had become undervalued in the years immediately after the moneyball revolution this new emphasis on defense was displayed in the  season although the athletics finished at  and again missed the playoffs they led mlb in defensive efficiency measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted in outs and allowed the fewest runs in the al in the  season the athletics
