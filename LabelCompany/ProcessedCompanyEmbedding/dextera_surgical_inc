razorrazor blade business modelproprietary stapler enables patients to leave hospital days sooner than present standard of careneed for cash will likely trigger dilution or sale of company within next  daysdextera surgical nasdaqdxtr is a very small m market cap medical device manufacturer with a very interesting product rollout that has the potential to radically alter the companys attractiveness to investors prior to august  dextera was previously named vascular innovations inc and later cardica inc both moneylosing entities racking up more than m in combined cumulative losses dextera is reinventing itself to be a surgical stapler manufacturer transitioning away from being a cardiac products manufacturer i believe dextera has reached an inflection point dextera has now invented and introduced a manual surgical stapling device called microcutter  whose features are said to make it a preferred approach for videoassisted lung surgery called vats according to management comments spoken during the q  earnings conference call lung surgery to remove tumors of the lung was traditionally practiced using an  open incision into the patients chest open surgery traditionally utilized sutures to stop blood flow recovery from open surgery is long and painful requiring a lengthy day stay in a hospital the modern use of video endoscopes and trocars subsequently enabled a minimally invasive surgery alternative called videoassisted thoracic surgery or vats in which the surgeon utilizes an array of five mm incisions ports to access the lungs and perform a lobectomy then suturing with trocars or stapling with a mm stapler to stop blood flow while vats is less disruptive to the patient it still requires a day stay in a hospital both alternatives open and fiveport vats are said to be painful with a slow recovery as the result of trauma to the patients rib cage  connective tissue between ribs must be cut and ribs partially removed or stretched apart now an even less invasive vats procedure called micro lobectomy has been enabled by an innovation in surgical stapling technology dexteras new microcutter  stapler is smaller in diameter than traditional staplers just mm and articulates enough so that just a single mm incision between the ribs and one below the ribs can be now used instead of the fiveincision technique early adopting surgeons have been able to practice microcutterenabled vats lobectomies that allow a patient to leave the hospital in a much shorter period of time in as little as one day with an average stay of three days this surgeons web site describes the surgery so dexteras new stapler isnt just a cool toy it creates economic savings for hospitals because the patient can be discharged more quickly obviously patients also prefer to be discharged from the hospital quickly and desire less pain during recovery as seen in this video testimonial surgical staplers are the quintessential razorrazor blade business model one sells a stapling device to the hospital thereafter hospitals purchase cartridges of staples in a recurring fashion  surgeons in both the us and the eu are said to be utilizing dexteras microcutter  now with plans to double surgeon adoption by june  dextera has described a m market size for its stapling device in just the us so i estimate row to be x the us market size dextera is presently manufacturing  manually controlled staplers a week to meet existing demand which along with  staple cartridges have an asp of  the company plans to increase production capacity to  staplersweek by the end of march  one can infer by the increase in production that sales prospects are improving as evidenced by the hiring of direct sales reps in the us and broadening distributor partnerships in the eu during the most recent earning conference call sales of the microcutter were projected to be k in q growing to k in q for a total of m in fy extrapolating its revenue growth based upon recent history and managements prediction for the remainder of this fiscal year ive created this threeyear forward looking table in this projection ive estimated revenue to increase  sequentially gross profit starts at  and increases as manufacturing expertise and supply chain efficiency are optimized further brightening future sales growth prospects dextera is also codeveloping the use of its stapler for robotic applications with intuitive surgical nasdaqisrg intuitive has already provided engineering development funding to codevelop a proof of concept entering into agreements whereby it will manufacture its own version of the dexteras stapler for use on the davinci robot while dextera will provide the staple cartridge however recurring revenue from its collaboration with intuitive isnt imminent according to comments made during the q earnings conference call dextera is to receive additional nonrecurring funding for the development of the staple cartridge used by the davinci in the next phase of the codevelopment project if my revenue and margin projections are correct and sgard remain constant dextera should be cash flow neutral in late  because it also has a legacy cardiac surgery product line dextera was formally named cardica that already contributes m revenue quarterly however given that the company presently expends mmo for sgard it needs to raise about m to defray my estimate of an additional  months of operating losses fortunately dextera only owes m in debt today due in september  to its japanese distributor who incidentally feels that dextera is presently in default dextera has a very limited amount of cash on hand today and will have to strengthen the balance sheet very shortly likely within the next couple of months for this reason dextera announced that it has enlisted jmp securities to assist it with funding options in a new development jmp has also been asked to assist in an additional option  a potential sale of the company applying a multiple should jmp locate a buyer for the company the multiple could be in the range of x sales based upon covidiens  acquisition of power medical interventions another surgical stapler manufacturer for m share  assumption of debt share pmi had m in sales at the time it was acquired during the worst of the great recession the link describes the purchase interestingly dexteras vp of worldwide sales and marketing was previously at pmi upside sales potential not forecast in the table expand the use of microcutters intended use beyond lung and general surgery to include liver surgery dextera anticipates fda to respond to its request this quarter this would open up sales of microcutter to a different surgeon population intuitives introduction of microcutter and subsequent sales which is unlikely before  dextera will receive an engineering purchase order to develop the stapling cartridge which should help investors better understand when to anticipate the receipt of recurring revenue japan and canada dextera has a distributor in japan which must receive regulatory approval before it can sell the microcutter  likewise dextera plans to submit the microcutter  to health canada for approvals both countries had previously approved predicate devices from dextera which may expedite regulatory approval top  things that could go wrong in  cannot raise cash or do so by diluting present shareholders by  very possible quality of hemostasis stopping blood flow isnt adequate management is presently enrolling patients in a study named match to document statistical outcomes a larger wellestablished company matches the performance of microcutter and sales cannot grow if so competitors product development would be secretive summary dextera is expected to rapidly grow through the broadening commercialization of its microcutter stapling device however shareholders may see the stock price fall as a result of raising badly needed capital i can speculate on three ways that jmp may be helping to allow dextera to bridge the next  months  raise cash with associated warrants that cause shareholder dilution  sale of the cardica product line to raise part of the cash that is required and  sell the entire company perhaps to a private equity concern that has the patience to wait until late  regardless of the funding approach management selects to enable the company to bridge the next  months in my opinion dextera will likely be acquired before the end of  perhaps sooner if it continues to execute and an acquiring company forecasts similar sales and gross margin projections for microcutter even if present shareholders are to be diluted by  to raise m in  should dextera realize a x trailing sales valuation by late  the company could fetch  share mm shares as such i consider the present stock price of  acceptable for an opening position in anticipation that dextera has finally figured out how to be profitable and will be acquired as a result disclosure i

states alone recent developments on june  dextera announced that it had filed a k with the fda for expanded indications of use in liver pancreas kidney and spleen surgery these indications account for more than  procedures in the united states and the company believes that the microcutter’s small size and increased articulation may contribute to less invasive surgeries surgeons in europe are

march   totaled  million compared with  million in the same period one year ago the decline was primarily attributable to  million of license revenue from intuitive surgical recorded in the third
