fleets which it sold at a loss in order to focus on the pet product business the company now operates in the pet natural health supplement and related fields  with a focus on natural pet green meadow pr formulas and pet pain preventative products we believe we will be able to successfully compete in todays natural supplement and related fields industry by controlling production costs and by limiting our distribution expenses using primarily online marketing tools to promote our products significant accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification no  revenue recognition asc asc requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required the companys revenues have been generated primarily through sublicense and distribution agreements related to our paw pal product and our pain relief products the terms of these agreements generally consist solely of upfront nonrefundable payments for licensing and distribution rights revenues from nonrefundable licensing and distribution fees are recognized upon receipt of the payment if the license has standalone value and we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations for the year ended june   and june   all license payments met the above criteria or in the case of one contract the only continuing involvement was to sell our products to the distributor at pricing that is consistent with market transactions thereby allowing for the recognition of revenue for the licensing and distribution arrangements upon receipt when nonrefundable license fees do not meet this criteria the license revenues are recognized over the expected period of performance we periodically review for any expected period of substantial involvement under the agreements that provide for nonrefundable upfront payments and license fees if ever applicable we will adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of our expected involvement on october   we entered into an agreement with ewh whereby it was agreed that in addition to the  paid by ewh for the nonexclusive sub licensing rights to manufacture and sell our green meadow pr formula we would also be paid a further  by ewh to identify a manufacturer for the green meadow pr formula and to initiate the manufacturing process under this arrangement ewh will have the right to purchase the product from us at the price we receive the product from the as yet to be appointed manufacturer including packaging but not labeling or shipping plus a markup of  on may   we were notified by eastwinds holding corp that they had selected a manufacturer with our assistance per our contract with ewh to manufacture their product eastwinds holding corp further confirmed that all our obligations under contract with them had been fulfilled and consequently we reclassified the deferred revenue to recognized revenue depending on the results of the manufacturing process for eastwinds holding we may or may not use the same manufacturer as of june   we have not yet made that determination use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

cheaper vendor for the product who was discontinuing the product line compared to june   where we recognized cost of goods sold of  relating to the dog treats which we sold for  in the period and the assistance in video production for  the increase in cost of goods was attributable to the cost of manufacturing of the dog treats and the video which was produced during the year gross profit for the year ended june   we recognized a gross profit of  compared with a gross profit of  for the year ended june   a decrease of  the decrease in gross profits is due to a decrease in sales of licensing

a formula for stress relief for dogs for  financing activities during the year ended june   and  we neither generated nor used any funds in financing activities our auditors report states the following with regard to our ability to continue as a going concern has yet to establish a reliable consistent and proven source of revenue to meet its operating costs on an ongoing basis and currently does not have sufficient available funding to fully implement its business plan these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the company believes it may have sufficient cash resources available to fund its primary operation for the next twelve  months but does not have the funding to fully implement its business plan the company has no agreements in place with its shareholders officer and director or with any third parties to fund operations the company has not negotiated nor has available to it any other third party sources of liquidity the company has no current off balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition related parties we entered into an agreement on january   with our president stanley windhorn for a salary to be paid in the amount of  per month for the three months ended march    was paid to mr windhorn per the agreement subsequently we determined that the revenues generated by the company were not sufficient to support operations and a salary we entered into a new employment agreement on april   which supersedes any past agreements whereby stan windhorn under the new agreement will be awarded compensation at the discretion of the companys board the company has not incurred any salary under this new agreement since april   through the date of the issuance of this from k plan of operation product development our future plan is to research the incorporation of our green meadow pr formula and our stress relief formula for dogs into a bite size bar which would have a flavor appealing to dogs the bar will be like a treat for dogs we are also researching the incorporation of a flavor into the pain relief tablets and stress relief tablets that dogs would find appealing to eat we have found that our current pain relief product is typically broken up into a dogs food as dogs do not generally like the taste of the tablet without food thus the ongoing research into finding an optimum way in which a flavor could be incorporated into a bar and tablet appealing to dogs cost for research and development of the green meadow pr formula and stress relief formula into bars or flavored tablets have not yet been determined we believe that we will have to raise additional capital either through debt or equity financing in order to accomplish our goals as of june   we have not yet discussed financing with any source for either debt or equity financing we are also considering the acquisition or the possibility of a joint venture with a company with other green green meaning environmentally friendly products both within the pet industry and outside of the pet industry as we have limited capital any acquisitions would possibly be done through the use of our common stock or possibly through a preferred class of stock which has of this date not been approved or created by the board of directors at the year ended june   we have not entered into any negotiations or letter of intents with and targeted acquisitions or joint venture prospects marketing and sales efforts our marketing efforts will primarily be related to seeking optimum methods for selling our bars and tablets once the flavors are optimized for the bars we plan on optimizing search engine optimization seo work and internet marketing and subsequently believe sales will be initially supported through our website we also plan on engaging a call center for developing interest in our products by pet stores and veterinarians we have not yet begun either stage of marketing we believe that once our bars are finalized for the green meadow pr formula and stress relief formula andor our flavored tablets are finalized we will be in a position to launch our marketing campaign we also believe that we will need to initially seek equity or debt financing to accomplish our marketing goals we anticipate initiating test sales of our bars in the quarter ending december   successful implementation of our business strategy depends on factors specific to the further development of our products regulations regarding equities trading additional financing through equity or debt sources and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the pet sector that may force us to reduce prices below the optimal desired pricing level or increase promotional spending the ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for trading products in a timely cost effective manner and the ability to establish maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment sep   c  cybernet

from the resale of these shares we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders the pet medications market is competitive and highly fragmented our competitors consist of veterinarians and online and traditional retailers we believe that the following are the principal competitive factors in our market  product selection and availability including the availability of prescription and nonprescription medications  brand recognition  reliability and speed of delivery  personalized service and convenience  price and  quality of website content we will compete with veterinarians pet retailers such as petsmart and petco as well as many online retailers of pet products for the sale of our natural pain relief products who sell prescription and nonprescription pet medications and other health products we intend to market our products in the united states none of the licensing rights previously sold to other companies prevent us from selling the pain relief formula under our own green meadow products brand within the united states while at the same time preventing those companies that we did market the product to from competing against us in the united states with the exception of eastwinds holding corporation and sandstone enterprises which acquired the licensing rights to distribute the product in north carolina and virginia however we retain the right to sell the product under our label in those states we sold the licensing rights to eastwinds holding corporation ewh for the untied states with the stipulation that ewh would private label the product and that we would have the right to purchase the product from ewh if we so chose at ewhs cost plus  of the price ewh receives the product from the manufacturer including packaging but not labeling or shipping under the terms of the agreement should we purchase the product from ewh we would private label the product further if we should establish a manufacturer and both parties are in agreement ewh shall have the right to purchase the product from us at a price of cost plus  of the price gm receives the product from the manufacturer including packaging but not labeling or shipping selling the rights to ewh could affect our ability to successfully market the product even though both ewh and gm would be selling the product under their own label regardless ewh would be a direct competitor for the united states market which could impact our ability to successfully market the product under our label there are similar products to ours which are available from numerous other sources including other distributors and manufacturers consolidation in the animal health products industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share which could give them greater pricing power decrease our revenues and profitability and increase the competition for customers we purchase our current pain relief product petaprin which is private labeled for us from vitanique who is a also a direct competitor as they sell the same product under their name many pet owners may prefer the convenience of purchasing their pet medications or other health products at the time of a veterinarian visit in order to effectively compete with veterinarians we must continue to educate pet owners about the potential benefits of a natural pain relief product convenience and savings offered by our company according to the american pet products manufacturers association pet spending in the united states increased  to  billion in  pet supplies and medications represented  billion or  of the total spending on pets in the united states the pet medication market that we participate in is estimated to be approximately  billion with veterinarians having the majority of the market share the dog and cat population is approximately  million with approximately  of all households having a pet we believe that the following are the main competitive strengths that will differentiate our products from the competition  all natural product  with our formula a chewable tablet that pets will potentially eat as they would a treat  unique niche products inclusive of our pain relief formula as well as out paw pal there are similar products to ours available from numerous other sources including other distributors and manufacturers we have not done a market study to determine all of the product lines which are similar to ours we will compete with veterinarians large pet retailers such as petsmart and petco as well as many online retailers of pet products for the sale of our natural pain relief products who sell prescription and nonprescription pet medications and other health products while our pain relief formula offers a formula comprised of the ingredients in a specific formulation there are many other companies that offer products with some or all of the same ingredients in different formulations we do not know the exact formulation of our competitors as such there may be competitors that offer the exact formulation or that offer a product with similar ingredients in a different formulation the company does not intend to directly compete against the larger pet retailers and manufacturers and it will not attempt to finance any projects beyond the limited scope of its business plans and on emerging distribution opportunities regardless it will still have competition from a wide range of even smaller online distributors of pet products as well as the veterinarians and pet stores all more established and in most instances better capitalized than the company company description green meadow products inc was incorporated in the state of wyoming on june   we were formed to develop businesses assets and opportunities some acquired and contributed from third parties and our founding shareholders in the natural health supplement and related fields with a focus on natural pet pain relief formulas and pet pain preventative products the company initially acquired a product for trucking fleets which it subsequently sold at a loss in order to focus on the pet product business the company believes it will be able to successfully compete in todays natural supplement and related fields industry by controlling production costs and by limiting its distribution expenses using primarily online marketing tools to promote its products and to further develop its digital strategies  green meadow products inc  industrial road ste  boulder city nevada  our telephone number  our

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates            customer and purchase concentration   during the quarter

company has no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued and outstanding during the quarters ended september   or       revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification no  revenue recognition asc asc requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required   the companys revenues have been generated primarily through sublicense and distribution agreements related to our paw pal product and our pain relief products the terms of these agreements generally consist solely of upfront nonrefundable payments for licensing and distribution rights revenues from nonrefundable licensing and distribution fees are recognized upon the completion of delivery of the license agreement and invoice to the customer andor receipt of the payment if the license has standalone value and we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations    recently issued accounting pronouncements   the company has reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective

other than in respect of the early adoption of the new regulations relating to development stage entities as discussed above   note – going concern   the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future as at september   the company had yet to establish a proven reliable recurring source of revenue to fund its ongoing operating costs and with insufficient funds to fully implement its proposed business plan this raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern            the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources the company is contemplating conducting an offering of its debt or equity securities to obtain additional operating capital the company is dependent upon its ability and will continue to attempt to secure equity andor debt financing there are no assurances that the company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the company to continue as a going concern   note   income taxes   the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes the sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows   for the three month period ended september   we did not recognize a tax
