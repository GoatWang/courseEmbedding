enquiry concerning human understandinga primary resource analysis by solana del bel belluzthe argumentthrough human reason and experience it can be said that miracles are impossible unless the falsehood of the testimony is the greater miraclemiracles are a violation of the laws of natureif any seemingly miraculous event has even once occurred in the natural world then it is not a miracleex a healthy man suddenly dying no such testimony that proves a miracle has ever actually occurred in historycontext and impacthume is one of the first truly radical skepticists of the enlightenment movementhis ideas are unique but are somewhat of a continuation of the work of past philosophershumes work inspired many other philosophers of the day and of later yearsissues of the timeways of reasoning induction deduction empiricism rationalism scepticismundermining the tyranny of the church and the monarchyrights and freedoms of man debate between democracy and monarchy corruption of society and natural innocence vs naturally corrupt and evil humanityreligious tolerancesome feminisminfluences on david humescottish  when an enquiry was publishedcalvinist motherother thinkers of the enlightenment movement predecessors john locke and george berkeleyliving in a harsh class systemcredibilityhume wrote an enquiry concerning human understanding to elaborate and clarify an earlier not so well received work called a treatise of human nature he may have been more excessive in his radical skepticism to create more of a buzz both works were published anonymously and intended for the public he may also have somewhat simplified his prose to make it accessible to the public conclusions and connectionshumes chapter on miracles reflects the more skeptical side of the enlightenment thinking but does well represent the support of individual thought and reasoning in the thinkers of the daythis source betters our understanding of the age of enlightenment by showing the diversion of thinkers already within such a unique group while one enlightened thinker deeply supports absolute monarchy another can be desperately working towards a republic while one thinker is practically an atheist another insists on our need for god in order have morality however this difference of opinions reflects the shared beliefs of all enlightened thinkers that each man has a right to his own beliefs and must come to his own conclusions based on a well backedup system of reasoningall taken from class power point course contentnotes internet history sourcebooks internet history sourcebooks
