gas leases known as the bison property learn more company overview barrel energy inc is an oil and gas company with a focus on assets located in north america currently the company holds oil  gas leases in alberta canada and its strategy is to exploit high impact and development oil plays and liquidsrich deep basin gas plays through the development of its asset base the company currently holds interest in  acres of oil  gas leases known as the bison property our near term business strategy is to conduct exploration activities on the bison property as laid out in more detail in the “description of property” section with the end goal being to achieve positive results during our exploration activities we believe we will be able to either develop the  bison property to commercial production and achieve positive cash flow property the bison property is located in the province of alberta canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land totalling  acres which includes one suspended gas well in the gilwood member of the middle devonian watt mountain formation the acreage is located in north western alberta in an area called the peace river arch pra which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west it is one of only a few largescale tectonic elements in the western canada sedimentary basin that has significantly disturbed the phanerozoic cover of the craton the structure has influenced the location of oil and gas accumulations in strata ranging from the middle devonian to the upper cretaceous and has long been a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in the region it is known for its prolific oil ngl and natural gas wells and is one of the most desirable light oil and natural gas liquids drilling areas in north america the peace river arch has already established facilities for natural gas gathering and compression facilities that can be accessed based on barrel energy’s needs although the peach river arch region boasts well established infrastructure weather conditions do play a role in our ability to access the bison property for instance the need to helicopter in equipment and or human resources may arise based on location or weather conditions geology the bison property is located in the province of alberta canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land  acres which includes one suspended gas well

feature caused by mountain building to the west sediments shed from the arch during deposition were deposited in abundance in braided channels fluvial stream channels and shallow marine environments which created numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area sediments were thickest adjacent to the emergent arch with sands in of up to  feet in total thickness deposited in the braided channel systems

independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire oil and gas properties throughout north america competition for the acquisition of oil and gas interests is strong with many oil and gas leases available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the financial and technological information or expertise to compete with all competitors our competitor oil and gas companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of oil and gas properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring oil and gas interests of merit or on exploring or developing their oil and gas properties this advantage could enable our competitors to acquire oil and gas properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development the potential for this competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further oil and gas interests or explore and develop our current or future oil and gas

in look for the pdf button the energy in a barrel of oil – let the sun work skip to content let the sun work sustainable living in a postpetroleum world search for the energy in a barrel of oil in grasping the challenge of peak oil it took us a while to come to grips with what a bonanza our treasure of oil has provided for us humans hey let’s be honest we still don’t get it and if you’re a typical human we understand it a lot better than you so let’s think about how much energy there is in a barrel of oil a barrel of oil contains  gallons the quality of oil varies the purest and easiest to refine is labeled “sweet” and the more sulfurladen and more challenging to refine is labeled “sour” we humans have already used up most of the sweet oil and we’re mostly down to sour oil by the way but that’s not the focus of this page the focus of this page is how much energy there is in an average barrel of oil a barrel of oil contains about six gigajoules of energy that’s six billion joules or  kilowatthours no we don’t have any idea how much that is either so let’s think about the equivalent sit a reasonably healthy male adult – let’s call him jim – on an exercise bike wired to an efficient generator and he can produce  watts for you so after jim has pedaled an hour he’s produced  watt hours of energy or  of a kwhour to produce the same energy as that in a gallon of gasoline  kilowatthours jim would need to pedal  x    hours we need to be legal of course so jim only pedals  hours per week jim’s desperate so let’s assume he agrees to take no breaks and never stops working to chat at the water cooler or to check in with his friends on facebook he pedals straight through for  hours per week he will have pedaled enough to equal the energy in a gallon of gasoline in a little more than eight weeks because jim’s desperate he gladly works for minimum wage so your energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline is a bargain at  x    how’s the price of gasoline lookin’ jim likes working for you so let’s ask him to pedal long enough to produce the same energy as that in a barrel of oil  kwhours easy to figure  divided by  or to say it another way  x  or  hours of pedaling that’s  weeks jim must love pedaling that bike because he never takes a vacation jim will have pedaled enough to produce the energy in a barrel of oil in  divided by    years congress has cooperated with you during this entire adventure and kept the minimum wage stable at  per hour so your energy equivalent from jim will cost you only  x    you’ll never remember  or  we sure don’t cheat down remember  per gallon of gas and  per barrel of oil those you can remember   barrel energy inc private company information  bloomberg july    pm et oil gas and consumable fuels company

from plants and animals that lived millions of years ago crude oil is a fossil fuel and it exists in liquid form in underground pools or reservoirs in tiny spaces within sedimentary rocks and near the surface in tar or oil sands petroleum products are fuels made from crude oil and other hydrocarbons contained in natural gas petroleum products can also be made from coal natural gas and biomass products made from crude oil after crude oil is removed from the ground it is sent to a refinery where different parts of the crude oil are separated into useable petroleum products these petroleum products include gasoline distillates such as diesel fuel and heating oil jet fuel petrochemical feedstocks waxes lubricating oils and asphalt a us gallon barrel of crude oil yields about  gallons of petroleum products in us refineries because of refinery processing gain this increase in volume is similar to what happens to popcorn when it is popped click to enlarge » more data » also on energy

the bison property learn more company overview barrel energy inc is an oil and gas company with a focus on assets located in north america currently the company holds oil  gas leases in alberta canada and its strategy is to exploit high impact and development oil plays and liquidsrich deep basin gas plays through the development of its asset base the company currently holds interest in  acres of oil  gas leases known as the bison property our near term business strategy is to conduct exploration activities on the bison property as laid out in more detail in the “description of property” section with the end goal being to achieve positive results during our exploration activities we believe we will be able to either develop the  bison property to commercial production and achieve positive cash flow property the bison property is located in the province of alberta canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land totalling  acres which includes one suspended gas well in the gilwood member of the middle devonian watt mountain formation the acreage is located in north western alberta in an area called the peace river arch pra which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west it is one of only a few largescale tectonic elements in the western canada sedimentary basin that has significantly disturbed the phanerozoic cover of the craton the structure has influenced the location of oil and gas accumulations in strata ranging from the middle devonian to the upper cretaceous and has long been a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in the region it is known for its prolific oil ngl and natural gas wells and is one of the most desirable light oil and natural gas liquids drilling areas in north america the peace river arch has already established facilities for natural gas gathering and compression facilities that can be accessed based on barrel energy’s needs although the peach river arch region boasts well established infrastructure weather conditions do play a role in our ability to access the bison property for instance the need to helicopter in equipment and or human resources may arise based on location or weather conditions geology the bison property is located in the province of alberta canada and is comprised of four sections of interest land  acres which includes one suspended gas well in the gilwood member of the middle devonian watt mountain formation the acreage is located in north western alberta in an area called the peace river arch pra which is a deep positive structural feature caused by mountain building to the west sediments shed from the arch during deposition were deposited in abundance in braided channels fluvial stream channels and shallow marine environments which created numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs in the area sediments were thickest adjacent to the emergent arch with sands in of up to  feet in total thickness deposited in the braided channel systems coming off the structural highland thicknesses decreased to the east away from the source rock ultimately terminating some  miles east from the pra the gilwood member at bison shows approximately  feet of gas pay over water in the gilwood formation and was perforated between m and m management gurminder sangha  president and ceo mr sangha has over  years of management and financing expertise in
