aaasf outlook stable  class b aasf outlook stable  class c nrsf key rating drivers strong credit quality credit quality for the pool is consistent with that of recent pools the weighted average wa

comprises  new vehicles adequate credit enhancement structure b is a sequentialpay structure initial hard credit enhancement ce for the class a notes totals   subordinated class b and c notes  initial overcollateralization and  reserve consistent lease maturities b consists of  undiscounted base residual value rv which is in line with prior pools the lease maturities are well distributed however there are six months that represent more than  of the total base rv with a highest singlemonth period in february  accounting for  and  of the pool maturing two years following close evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has remained strong in recent years however increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realization during the life of the transaction stable corporate health fitch currently rates the longterm idr of ford the parent of ford credit and ford credit bbb with a positive rating outlook consistent originationunderwritingservicing ford credit demonstrates good capabilities as originator underwriter and servicer this is evidenced by historical delinquency credit and residual value loss performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations fitch deems ford credit capable of adequately servicing b legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of ford credit would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to ford credit auto lease trust b to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses showing downgrades of one rating category under fitchs x base case loss scenario additionally downgrades of one or two rating categories were seen under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario the transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss volatility as such under its severe residual loss scenario fitch would expect to downgrade the class of notes by two or more rating categories the presale report is available at wwwfitchratingscom or by clicking on the below link link to fitch ratings report
