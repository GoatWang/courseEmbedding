walton enterprises the family holding company that jim manages with his siblings rob and alice both directly and through their trusteeship of their late brother john’s estate the waltons’ stake in walmart only recently crossed the  threshold and this has implications under new york stock exchange rules as a bloomberg story recently explained “some institutional investors are expressing concern that the founding family’s stake allows the chain to have a minority of independent directors as a result of buybacks the waltons own at least  percent of outstanding shares up from about  percent a decade ago under new york stock exchange rules that makes walmart a controlled company allowing it to opt out of a requirement to have a majority of independent directors” as a member of walmart’s

recognized as a prolific donor to politicians at both the federal and state level—indeed in  and  the arkansas democratgazette reported that walton topped the list of arkansans giving directly to candidates or political action committees federal contributions jim walton has given  in federal elections since the beginning of the  election cycle— went to republicans or republicanaffiliated political action committees walton made headlines for some of his largest contributions a total of  to restore our future the super pac associated with mitt romney’s  run for president and another  to our destiny the super pac associated with jon huntsman in  extreme rightwing agenda jim walton has a troubling history of supporting an extreme rightwing agenda through his political contributions his preferred causes are antilgbt anticivil rights and antipublic education anticivil rights jim walton drew attention in late  for statelevel contributions in arkansas to extremist politicians and causes walton and his wife lynne have contributed  to extremist arkansas state senator jason rapert rconway since december  according to financial reports filed with the arkansas secretary of state rapert

discriminatory voter id laws privatizing education after mauch’s views and walton’s contribution drew attention jim walton asked that the contribution be returned “the contribution was made because of your support for education reform in arkansas” walton’s letter to the campaign reads “since making the contribution however i have learned about some of your views on other issues with which i disagree” mauch’s views on education are wildly outlandish based on letters written in this decade to the arkansas democrat gazette  “public education was forced upon the south during reconstruction to complete the aim of the radical socialists which was to destroy southern conservatism” “public education is one of the  planks of the communist manifesto” desegregation of american schools “was never about education but rather the postamerican despotic federal government coercing its will by using the military to execute the whims of a tyrannical judiciary” in  jim and john walton both gave

passed but has since been struck down by the arkansas state supreme court although defended by waltonbacked extremist state representative jason rapert wisconsin  the wisconsin center for investigative journalism reported in september  that jim walton and his wife lynne were among the top individual contributors to winning state legislative candidates in the  elections that put
