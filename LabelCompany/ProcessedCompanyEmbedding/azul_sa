approximately r  million after deducting commissions and estimated expenses payable by us and assuming an initial public offering of r  per preferred share and us   per ads based on an exchange rate of r  to us as of    which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus we are undertaking this global offering in order to access the public capital markets with the main objective of financing our future expansion plans we intend to use the net proceeds from this global offering for the following purposes •   million to invest in aircraft to grow our fleet •   million to fund the capital expenditures needed to increase the number of destinations in our network •   million to repay the debt of r million that we owe to bozano under the loan agreements this indebtedness carries interest at a rate of  per year and is due to be repaid in full on june   but will become immediately payable upon the initial public offering of our preferred shares the proceeds of this indebtedness were used for working capital needs •   million to repay a total of us million approximately r million calculated at the exchange rate of r per us at march   which is the aggregate amount outstanding on five junior loans we guarantee that will become immediately due and payable following our initial public offering and •   million for general corporate purposes we will not receive any proceeds from the offering of preferred shares including in the form of adss by the selling shareholders assuming the overallotment option is exercised who we estimate will receive net proceeds of r  million in this global offering assuming the full exercise of the options to purchase additional preferred shares including in the form of adss the two largest airlines in brazil are gol and tam both gol and tam operate similar hubandspoke networks which require that passengers on many of their routes connect through the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro or brasília we face competition from gol tam and other airlines such as lowcost carriers and potential new entrant airlines on all our routes that are also served by any of these airlines the principal competitive factors on these routes that are served by more than one airline are fare pricing total price flight schedules aircraft type passenger amenities number of routes served from a city customer service safety record and reputation code sharing relationships and frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities as a result of our innovative business model which is based on stimulating demand in underserved markets we are less susceptible to the effects of fare competition involving our two main competitors which fly from the airports in the city of são paulo while gol tam or any other airline may enter the markets we currently serve exclusively or which we hold a large market share we believe that our business model is unique and allows us to avoid competition in numerous of the markets we serve in particular from our competitors operating larger aircraft such as gol and tam before we started our operations gol and tam controlled over  of the brazilian airline market since december  the brazilian airline market has grown significantly partially because of i our entry into the market which stimulated demand and ii the organic growth of the market with more individuals using airline transportation services as a result despite the fact that gol and tam lost market share following our entry into the market the number of passengers transported by both airlines increased in that time period as of march   we had a  market share of domestic rpks according to anac and a  market share of domestic departures according to innovata even though our principal competitors on many of our routes are gol and tam as of december  we competed with tam and gol on only  of our routes in campinas our primary hub only four out of  routes faced direct competition from gol or tam as of december  the following table provides details with respect to the competition faced on our top five routes based on weekly frequency as of march  at march   departures per day azul gol tam campinas—rio de janeiro    belo horizonte—campinas  — — campinas—curitiba  — — porto alegre—campinas  — — belém—altamira  — — belo horizonte—vitória   — guarulhos—belo horizonte    campinas—navegantes  — — são josé do rio preto—campinas  — — salvador—campinas  — — campinas—brasília    goiânia—campinas  — — campinas—cuiaba  — — campinas—ribeirão preto  — — belo horizonte—ipatinga  — — source anac in addition to other airlines our competitors also include companies catering to other forms of transportation principally bus services notwithstanding competition generated from other forms of transportation the middle class in brazil is expanding and air travel is becoming an affordable option to such growing middle class we believe that most of our fares are competitive with the cost of road travel on many of our routes in particular the discounted fares we offer based on our yield management system for advance purchases company description we were founded by entrepreneur david neeleman in  and are the latest of his four airline ventures with sustained operational viability from inception to date in three different countries including jetblue airways backed by mr neeleman and other key shareholders such as weston presidio tpg growth gávea investimentos grupo bozano and grupo águia branca we are highly capitalized and have invested in a robust and scalable business model we have a management team that combines local knowledge with experience in best practices from the united states the worlds largest and most competitive aviation market in  we acquired trip which at the time was the largest regional carrier in south america by number of destinations as a result of the trip acquisition we began service in  additional cities the fleet similarity between azul and trip has allowed us to integrate all our operations rapidly and start yielding synergy gains as measured by the sum of estimated revenue synergies plus estimated net cost synergies of r million to r million in  and r million to r million in  the acquisition substantially increased our network connectivity enabling us to become the leading carrier by departures in  cities as of december   and consolidate our position as a leader in brazils fastgrowing regional aviation market through the acquisition we became the leading carrier in belo horizonte brazils third largest metropolitan area and gained strategic landing rights at guarulhos airport in são paulo and santos dumont airport in rio de janeiro complementing our hub at campinas in the state of são paulo we believe we have created a robust network of profitable routes by stimulating demand through frequent and affordable air service we select routes that we believe possess high demand and growth potential and are either not served or underserved by other airlines we believe this model has enabled us to stimulate significant new demand to become the market leader in the majority of the markets we serve our fleet of  aircraft in service composed of  modern embraer ejets which seat up to  customers and  fuelefficient atr aircraft which seat up to  customers allows us to effectively match capacity to demand and offer more convenient and frequent nonstop service than our main competitors who fly larger aircraft we believe this structure not only stimulates demand from business travelers who tend to travel more as a result of increased flight frequencies but also attracts costconscious leisure travelers many of whom are first time flyers by offering low fares for advance purchases in addition our aircraft enable us to serve smaller markets profitably and connect them to our extensive network with an average age of four years at december   our fleet is younger than those of our main competitors gol and tam we believe we have built a strong brand by offering a highquality travel experience based on a culture of customer service provided by a team of crewmembers who we train to be highly motivated and cultivated through the past ventures of our founder david neeleman among other awards we were named best low cost carrier in the world in  by capa an independent aviation market intelligence provider and best low cost carrier in latin america in both  and  by skytrax an aviation research organization our service offering features individual entertainment screens incorporating free livetv at every seat on virtually all of our jets extensive legroom with a pitch of  inches or more twobytwo seating with no middle seats complimentary beverage and snack services and free bus service to key airports including between the city of são paulo and campinas airport as of march   we were the market leader by frequency on  of our routes as the only airline operating on  of our routes and the most frequent carrier on an additional  of our routes according to iata this extensive network coverage allows us to offer more itineraries and connections than our competitors which serve a significantly lower number of destinations we believe that this leading network position has enabled us to achieve significantly higher prask than other domestic carriers in the fouryear period ended march   in  we achieved an average load factor of  and generated a  prask premium relative to gol according to its yearend  public disclosure in addition for the three months ended march   we maintained an average load factor of  and generated a  prask premium relative to gol according to its quarterly results of operations filed with the sec for the first quarter of  utilizing smaller aircraft with lower fuel consumption gives us trip costs lower than those of our main competitors for example our endofperiod ftes per operating aircraft was the lowest in brazil at  compared to  for latam and  for gol as of march   according to their end of first quarter  public disclosures our leading revenue performance driven by superior load factors combined with our efficient operations and competitive cost structure enabled us to achieve an adjusted ebitdar margin for the three months ended march   of  compared to  for gol our main competitor according to its quarterly results of operations filed with the sec for the first quarter of  for a description of how we calculate adjusted ebitdar see summary financial and operating data below unlike other airlines loyalty programs our loyalty program tudo azul rewards customers for the amount of money paid for flights as opposed to the number of miles flown the program had more than  enrolled members at december   and more than  members at march   we have plans to expand the scope of tudo azul through commercial partnerships with companies from other industries where we believe our brand provides a competitive advantage such as azulbranded credit cards our current tudo azul partners include banco itaú banco santander american express and walmart among numerous others as tudo azul expands we may consider managing it as a separate business unit our hubandspoke network is an integral part of our model of stimulating demand since it allows us to consolidate traffic by serving larger and mediumsized markets including every state capital in brazil as well as smaller cities that do not generate sufficient demand for pointtopoint service we believe our main competitors with their larger aircraft are unable to generate sufficient demand to serve most of our markets profitably our main hubs are located in campinas and belo horizonte two of the largest metropolitan areas in the country campinas is located approximately  kilometers  miles from the city of são paulo and has a catchment area of approximately seven million people in a km radius according to ibge we are the leading airline at campinas with a  share of the airports  daily departures as of march   as a result of heightened demand driven by our entry into campinas as of march   the campinas airport served  destinations the most nonstop domestic flights of any brazilian airport other key strategic destinations in our network include the cities of são paulo guarulhos airport rio de janeiro santos dumont and galeão airports salvador and manaus brazil which is geographically similar in size to the continental united states had the second fastestgrowing domestic aviation market in the world in  and is expected to be the third largest market for domestic passengers in  according to iata we believe brazil continues to show significant growth potential as air travel is still significantly underpenetrated with  average flight segments flown per person per year compared to  in a mature market such as the united states in  the core of our strategy is to drive greater profitability by growing our network adding new destinations further interconnecting our current destinations and increasing frequency in existing markets we believe this continued rollout will stimulate further demand reducing cask and increasing margins through the economies of scale created by optimizing our resources and staff we also intend to continue growing our ancillary revenue streams such as cargo operations and travel packages by leveraging our existing products and expanding our offerings  we are incorporated as a brazilian sociedade por ações  our headquarters are at edifício jatobá  th

largest airlines in brazil are gol and tam both gol and tam operate similar hubandspoke networks which require that passengers on many of their routes connect through the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro or brasília we face competition from gol tam and other airlines such as lowcost carriers and potential new entrant airlines on all our routes that are also served by any of these airlines the principal competitive factors on these routes that are served by more than one airline are fare pricing total price flight schedules aircraft type passenger amenities number of routes served from a city customer service safety record and reputation code sharing relationships and frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities as a result of our innovative business model which is based on stimulating demand in underserved markets we are less susceptible to the effects of fare competition involving our two main competitors which fly from the airports in the city of são paulo while gol tam or any other airline may enter the markets we currently serve exclusively or which we hold a large market share we believe that our business model allows us to avoid competition in numerous of the markets we serve in particular from our competitors operating larger aircraft such as gol and tam before we started our operations gol and tam controlled over  of the brazilian airline market from  to  the brazilian airline market has grown significantly partially because of i our entry into the market which stimulated demand and ii the organic growth of the market with more individuals using airline transportation services as a result despite the fact that gol and tam lost market share following our entry into the market the number of passengers transported by both airlines increased in that time period as of september   we had a  market share of domestic rpks according to anac even though our principal competitors on many of our routes are gol and tam as of december  we competed with tam and gol on only  of our routes in campinas our primary hub only six out of  destinations faced direct competition from gol or tam as of december  the following table provides details with respect to the competition faced on our top five routes based on weekly frequency as of september   at september   flights per day azul gol tam campinas—rio de janeiro    campinas—belo horizonte   — guarulhos são paulo—belo horizonte    campinas—curitiba   — campinas—porto alegre  — — campinas—brasília    belo horizonte—vitória   — belo horizonte—ipatinga  — — campinas—cuiabá  — — campinas—navegantes  — — campinas—ribeirão preto  — — belo horizonte—montes claros   — source innovata in addition to other airlines our competitors also include companies catering to other forms of transportation principally bus services notwithstanding competition generated from other forms of transportation the middle class in brazil is expanding and air travel is becoming an affordable option to such growing middle class we believe that most of our fares are competitive with the cost of road travel on many of our routes in particular the discounted fares we offer based on our yield management system for advance purchases international as we expand our international services to select international destinations our pool of competitors will increase and we will face competition from brazilian united states south american and other foreign airlines that are already established in the international market and that participate in strategic alliances and codesharearrangements in addition nonbrazilian airlines may decide to enter or increase their schedules in the market for routes between brazil and other international destinations in  anac approved regulations regarding international fares for flights departing from brazil to the united states and europe which gradually removes the previous minimum fares in  anac approved the continuity of bilateral agreements providing for open skies policies with other south american countries as well as a new open skies policy with the united states that is expected come into force in  in march  brazil also signed an open skies agreement with europe that is expected come into force in  these new regulations should increase the number of passengers in south america and may enable the expansion of our international services on the other hand we may face further competition on this expanded south american market company description we have been the fastest growing airline in brazil in terms of asks since we commenced operations in december  and currently have the largest airline network in the country in terms of cities served with service at september   to  destinations  routes and  departures per day we are in the process of expanding our operations with selected nonstop service to highdemand locations in the united states which we expect to launch in december  our model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and affordable air service to underserved markets with the result that we are the sole airline on  of our existing routes and have a  share of the brazilian aviation market in terms of departures we were founded by entrepreneur david neeleman and are the latest of his four airline ventures with sustained operational viability in three different countries including jetblue airways backed by mr neeleman and other key shareholders such as weston presidio tpg growth fidelity gávea investimentos and grupo bozano we are highly capitalized and have invested in a robust and scalable business model we have a management team that combines local knowledge with diversified experience in and knowledge of best practices from the united states the world’s largest and most competitive aviation market in  we acquired trip which at the time was the largest regional carrier in south america by number of destinations and have consolidated its results of operations into our financial statements since november   the acquisition substantially increased our network connectivity enabling us to become the leading carrier by departures in  cities as of september   and consolidate our position as the leader in brazil’s fastgrowing regional aviation market through the acquisition we became the leading carrier in belo horizonte brazil’s third largest metropolitan area and gained strategic landing rights at guarulhos airport in são paulo and santos dumont airport in rio de janeiro complementing our hub at campinas in the state of são paulo in addition our operating results have significantly improved since the acquisition reflecting what we believe are the synergy gains of our combined networks we believe we have created a robust network of profitable routes by stimulating demand through frequent and affordable air service we select routes that we believe possess high demand and growth potential and are either not served or underserved by other airlines we believe we can continue expanding our domestic network while simultaneously leveraging the strong connectivity we have created in brazil to benefit from the addition of select international destinations in the united states our flexible fleet enables us to serve smaller and larger markets by connecting them to our extensive network of destinations our operating fleet of  aircraft composed of  modern embraer ejets which seat up to  customers and  fuelefficient atr aircraft which seat up to  customers allows us to effectively match capacity to demand and offer more convenient and frequent nonstop service than our main competitors who exclusively fly larger aircraft within brazil we believe this structure not only stimulates demand from business travelers who tend to travel more as a result of increased flight frequencies but also attracts costconscious leisure travelers many of whom are first time flyers by offering low fares for advance purchases our current business plan contemplates the addition of nextgeneration narrowbody and widebody aircraft which are more fuelefficient than current generation aircraft as fuel represents more than  of our total operating costs we believe that the addition of nextgeneration aircraft will allow us to further improve the efficiency of our fleet we believe that our strategic fleet plan will allow us to maintain industryleading trip costs and further reduce our cask both in absolute terms and relative to our competitors with an average age of  years at september   our operating fleet is younger than that of our main competitors gol and tam in addition we expect that the a cquisition of larger narrowbody and widebody aircraft will allow us to further enhance profitability when servicing highdensity markets that allow for the profitable use of larger aircraft as well as to service select international destinations we believe we have built a strong brand by offering a highquality travel experience based on a culture of customer service provided by a highly motivated team of crewmembers among other awards we were named “best low cost carrier in latin america” in    and  by skytrax an independent aviation research organization and “best low cost carrier in the world” in  by capa an independent aviation research organization our domestic service offering features individual entertainment screens incorporating free livetv at every seat on virtually all of our jets extensive legroom with a pitch of  inches or more twobytwo seating with no middle seats complimentary beverage and snack services and free bus service to key airports including between the city of são paulo and campinas airport as of september   we were the market leader by frequency on  of our routes as the only airline operating on  of our routes and the most frequent carrier on an additional  of our routes according to innovata data this extensive network coverage allows us to offer more itineraries and connections than our competitors which serve a significantly smaller number of destinations we believe that this leading network position has enabled us to achieve significantly higher prask than other domestic carriers in the fiveyear period ended december   for the nine months ended september   we had an average load factor of  and generated a  prask premium relative to gol according to its publicly available results of operations furnished to the sec for the nine months ended september   we believe that by using the rightsized aircraft for the markets we serve we are able to have lower trip costs than our competitors our fleet of atr and ejets enables us to penetrate markets that our competitors who only fly larger narrowbody aircraft cannot serve profitably our modern ejets seat up to  customers and our fuelefficient atr aircraft seat up to  customers while the narrowbody aircraft used by our two principal competitors in brazil have between  and  seats and are therefore not suited to serve markets with lower demand profitably as a result the average trip cost for our combined fleet of ejets and atrs is  lower than that of larger boeing  jets flown by gol our main competitor according to its results of operations furnished to the sec for the nine months ended september   in addition our endofperiod ftes per aircraft as of september   was the lowest in brazil at  compared to  for latam and  for gol as of september   according to their respective results of operations furnished to the sec for the nine months ended september   we expect to continue to utilize our embraer ejets to service highdemand routes targeted at business travelers and our atr aircraft to service shorthaul and smaller regional airports and to continue to seek to provide low cost air service to these cities and locations we also plan to receive new nextgeneration airbus aneos which are more fuelefficient than current generation narrowbody aircraft starting in  to serve domestic longhaul routes with highdemand targeted at leisure travelers including the northeast of brazil we have recently announced an intention to begin limited international service and are acquiring new aircraft for this and expanded domestic service we believe that our leading revenue performance driven by superior load factors combined with our efficient operations and competitive cost structure enabled us to achieve an adjusted ebitdar margin of  in  and  for the nine months ended september   in  we generated total revenues of r billion us billion and a net income of r million us million and for the nine months ended september   our revenues totaled r billion us billion with a net loss of r million us million with more than  million members as of september   our loyalty program tudoazul has been the fastest growing frequent flyer program among our two main competitors for the past  years according to information publicly available on the websites of smiles and multiplus we believe our program has a more efficient cost structure as it rewards customers for the amount paid for flights as opposed to the number of miles flown thereby seeking to create a stronger link between passenger revenue and loyalty rewards we are expanding the scope of tudoazul and have launched an azul branded credit card in september of  in partnership with banco itaucard sa our current tudoazul partners include american express banco do brasil banco itaú bradesco banco santander caixa hsbc among numerous others in addition we believe that the introduction of international flights to our network will provide our tudoazul members with a broader range of more compelling and attractive redemption options to maximize the value creation potential of tudoazul going forward we have recently started to manage the program as a separate business unit on a standalone basis tudoazul’s sale of points to third parties totaled r million during the last twelve months ended september   given the number of exclusive destinations we operate our network strength and the projected growth of passenger air travel in brazil we believe that tudoazul will help increase operating revenues for our primary passenger travel business our hubandspoke network is an integral part of our model of stimulating demand since it allows us to consolidate traffic by serving larger and mediumsized markets including every state capital in brazil as well as smaller cities that do not generate sufficient demand for pointtopoint service as of september    of our passengers at campinas airport were in transit to another destination and  of all of our customers at the same period were connecting to other destinations through our network we believe our main competitors who only fly larger aircraft are unable to generate sufficient demand to serve most of our markets profitably as a result of our differentiated business strategy we were the sole airline in  of the destinations we serve and on  of our routes as of september   our main hubs are located in campinas and belo horizonte two of the largest metropolitan areas in the country campinas is one of the wealthiest cities in brazil according to ibge located approximately  kilometers  miles from the city of são paulo and has a catchment area of approximately seven million people in a km radius according to ibge we are the leading airline at campinas with a  share of the airport’s  daily departures as of september   as a result of heightened demand driven by our entry into campinas as of september   the campinas airport served  destinations the most nonstop domestic flights of any brazilian airport our second largest hub is located at the main airport of belo horizonte capital of the third wealthiest state in brazil according to ibge where we currently serve  destinations and have a  share of the airport’s  daily departures as of september   in addition we are the fastest growing airline at guarulhos airport the largest airport in brazil located near são paulo representing  of the airport’s growth in terms of domestic departures for the  months ended september   as of september   we offered  daily flights to  destinations from guarulhos airport other smaller hubs that contribute to the increased connectivity of our network include porto alegre curitiba cuiabá and manaus brazil which is geographically similar in size to the continental united states is the third largest market for domestic passengers after the united states and china and is expected to reach  million domestic passengers by  an increase of  million passengers compared to  million in  according to innovata data we believe brazil continues to show significant growth potential as air travel is still significantly underpenetrated with  average flight segments flown per person per year compared to  in a mature market such as the united states in  the core of our strategy is to drive greater profitability by growing our network on a domestic and international basis adding new destinations further interconnecting our current destinations and increasing frequency in existing markets we believe this continued rollout will stimulate further demand reducing cask and increasing margins through the economies of scale created by optimizing our resources and staff we also intend to continue growing our ancillary revenue streams which represented r per passenger in the nine months ended september   including cargo operations and travel packages by leveraging our existing products and expanding our
