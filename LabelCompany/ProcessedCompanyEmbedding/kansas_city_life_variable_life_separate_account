account value the flexibility of this policy allows you to change the amount of insurance as your needs for insurance change some changes require underwriting approval as with all life insurance the main purpose for buying a universal life insurance policy is the death protection provided to your loved ones at your death taxfree variable life variable universal life insurance vul is designed to build a cash value in a vul the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts similar to mutual funds and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner the premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the irs code for life insurance term life term life insurance is perhaps the simplest form of life insurance it was developed to provide temporary life insurance protection on a limited budget since term insurance can be purchased in large amounts for a relatively small initial premium it is well suited for shortrange goals such as life insurance coverage for paying off a loan dependent care or college education for dependents survivorship life survivorship or second to die is very similar to universal life except that it insures two people the primary feature is that no death benefit is paid until both persons insured under the policy have died this policy is specifically designed to provide funds at the death of the second spouse to cover estate tax liability this policy can provide needed funds so that the familys estate is preserved for the heirs indexed life indexed universal life is permanent life insurance designed to provide deathbenefit protection in addition it offers the upside potential of interest linked to a stockmarket index  without the risk of investing directly in the market this gives you and your clients the ability to combine life insurance guarantees with the opportunity to earn index interest whole life whole lifes primary uses are guaranteed death benefit guaranteed cash values fixed annual premiums access to cash values and the fact that mortality and expense charges will not reduce the cash value shown in the policy this page

satisfactory proof at our home office of the insured s death death benefits are available as lump sum or under a variety of payment options the minimum specified amount is  for issue ages  and  for issue ages we may allow these minimum limits to be reduced see applying for a contract there are three coverage options available option a at least equal to the specified amount option b at least

interest to the next contract anniversary a  annual effective interest rate applies currently a preferred loan is available in the  th contract year loans reduce the amount available for allocations and transfers loans may have tax consequences see tax considerations  full surrender you may surrender your contract at any time for its cash surrender value a surrender charge may apply surrendering the contract may have tax consequences see tax considerations partial surrender partial surrenders generally are available provided you have enough remaining cash surrender value a partial surrender fee applies partial surrenders may have adverse tax consequences see tax considerations transfers you may transfer amounts among the subaccounts and the fixed account subject to certain restrictions there is no limit on the number of transfers you can make between the subaccounts or to the fixed account the first six transfers during each contract year are free after the first six transfers we will assess a  transfer processing fee unused free transfers do not carry over to the next contract year we will deduct any transfer processing fee from the remaining contract value tax benefits we intend for the contract to satisfy the definition of life insurance under the internal revenue code code therefore the death benefit generally should be excludable from the gross income of its recipient but may be subject to state and federal estate taxes similarly you should not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the contract value and therefore should not be taxed on increases in the contract value until you take out a loan or partial surrender or surrender the contract in addition transfers of contract value among the subaccounts andor the fixed account are not taxable transactions see tax considerations free look right to cancel for a limited time you have the right to cancel your contract and receive a refund see free look right to cancel contract during this

these riders may not be available in all states additional rules and limits apply to these supplemental andor rider benefits please ask your registered representative for further information or contact the home office illustrations we may prepare for use in marketing and other materials tables to illustrate hypothetically how certain values under a contract change with investment performance over an extended period of time such tables illustrate how contract values cash surrender values and death benefits under a contract covering an insured of a given age would vary over time if planned premiums were paid annually and the return on the assets in each of the funds were an assumed uniform gross annual rate  actual returns will fluctuate over time and will be both positive and negative the actual values under the contract could be significantly different from those shown even if actual returns averaged the rates used in the illustrations but fluctuated over and under those averages throughout the years shown depending on the timing and degree of fluctuation the actual values could be substantially less than those shown and may under certain circumstances result in the lapse of the contract unless the owner pays more than the stated premium such illustrations show contract values based on both current charges and guaranteed charges contract risks investment risk if you invest your contract value in one or more subaccounts then you will be subject to the risk that investment performance will be unfavorable and that the contract value will decrease in addition we deduct contract fees and charges from your contract value there is no minimum guaranteed contract value the contract value may decrease if the investment performance of the subaccounts to which contract value is allocated is negative or is not sufficiently positive to cover the charges deducted under the contract during times of poor investment performance these deductions will have an even greater impact on your contract value you could lose everything you invest if you allocate net premiums to the fixed account then we credit your fixed account value with a declared rate of interest you assume the risk that the rate may decrease although it will never be lower than a guaranteed minimum annual effective rate of  risk of lapse if the contract value is not enough to pay the monthly deduction when due the contract will terminate without value after a grace period the purpose of the grace period is to give you the chance to pay enough premiums to keep your contract in force if your contract does lapse you must pay the required amount before the end of the grace period the grace period is  days and starts when we send the notice since the value of amounts allocated to the variable account will vary according to the investment performance of the funds the specific amount of premiums required to prevent termination will also vary a lapse could result in adverse tax consequences tax risks in order to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law a contract must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code guidance as to how these requirements are to be applied is limited nevertheless we believe that contracts issued on a standard basis should satisfy the applicable requirements there is less guidance however with respect to contracts issued on a substandard basis and such contracts may not satisfy the applicable requirements in all circumstances particularly if you pay the full amount of premiums permitted under the contract depending on the total amount of premiums you pay the contract may be treated as a modified endowment contract under federal tax laws if a contract is treated as a modified endowment contract then surrenders withdrawals and loans under the contract will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent there are earnings in the contract in addition a  penalty tax may be imposed on surrenders withdrawals and loans taken before you reach age ½ if the contract is not a modified endowment contract then distributions generally will be treated first as a return of basis or investment in the contract and then as taxable income moreover loans will generally not be treated as distributions although the tax treatment of preferred loans is unclear finally neither distributions nor loans from a contract that is not a modified endowment contract are subject to the  penalty tax see tax considerations you should consult a qualified tax adviser for assistance in all contractrelated tax matters risk of increase in current fees and expenses certain fees and expenses are currently assessed at less than their maximum levels we may increase these current charges in the future up to the guaranteed maximum levels if fees and expenses are increased you may need to increase the amount andor frequency of premiums to keep the contract in force surrender and partial surrender risks during the first fifteen contract years we will deduct a surrender charge from the contract value if the contract is completely surrendered or lapses an additional surrender charge and surrender charge period will apply to each portion of the contract resulting from a specified amount increase starting with the effective date of the increase under some circumstances the amount of the surrender charge during the first few contract years could result in a cash surrender value of zero you should purchase the contract only if you have the financial ability to keep it in force for a substantial period of time you should not purchase the contract if you intend to surrender all or part of the contract value in the near future we designed the contract to meet longterm financial goals the contract is not suitable as a shortterm investment  even if you do not surrender your contract surrender charges may play a role in determining whether your contract will lapse because surrender charges affect the cash surrender value which is a measure we use to determine whether your contract will enter the grace period and possibly terminate see risk of lapse a surrender or partial surrender may have tax consequences see tax considerations loan risks a contract loan will affect your contract in several ways over time whether or not it is repaid because the investment results of the subaccounts may be less than or greater than the net interest rate credited on the amount transferred to the loan account securing the loan your contract value by comparison to a contract under which no loan has been made will be less if the fixed account interest rate is less than the investment return of the applicable subaccounts and greater if the fixed account interest rate is higher than the investment return of the applicable subaccounts a contract loan increases the risk that the contract will terminate since a loan decreases the cash surrender value if the death benefit becomes payable while a contract loan is outstanding the loan balance will be deducted in calculating the death proceeds a loan may have tax consequences in addition if you surrender the contract or allow it to lapse while a contract loan is outstanding the amount of the loan to the extent it has not previously been taxed will be added to any amount you receive and taxed accordingly see tax considerations risk of frequent transfers we have policies and procedures that attempt to detect frequent large programmed or shortterm transfers among the subaccounts that may adversely affect other owners and persons with rights under the contracts we employ various means to try to detect such transfer activity but the detection and deterrence of harmful trading activity involves judgments that are inherently subjective our ability to detect such transfer activity may be limited by operational and technological systems as well as our ability to predict strategies employed by owners to avoid such detection accordingly there is no assurance that we will prevent all transfer activity that may adversely affect owners and other persons with interests under the contracts in addition we cannot guarantee that the funds will not be harmed by transfer activity related to other insurance companies andor retirement plans that may invest in the funds portfolio risks a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each fund portfolio may be found in each portfolio s prospectus please refer to the portfolios prospectuses for more information there is no assurance that any portfolio will achieve its stated investment objective  fee table the following tables

features and optional programs these contracts would also have different charges that would affect your subaccount performance and contract value to obtain more information about these other contracts contact your registered representative note because this is a summary it does not contain all the information that may be important to you you should read this entire prospectus and the funds prospectuses carefully before investing contract benefits death benefits we pay a death benefit to the beneficiary if the insured dies while the contract is in force and prior to the contract s maturity date we pay the death benefit when we receive satisfactory proof at our home office of the insured s death death benefits are available as lump sum or under a variety of payment options the

loans you may take loans for amounts up to the cash surrender value less loan interest to the next contract anniversary a  annual effective interest rate applies currently a preferred loan is available in the th contract year loans reduce the amount available for allocations and transfers loans may have tax consequences see tax considerations full surrender you may surrender your contract at any time for its cash surrender value a surrender charge may apply surrendering the contract may have tax consequences see tax considerations partial surrender partial surrenders generally are available provided you have enough remaining cash surrender value a partial surrender fee applies we will assess a surrender charge for any resulting reduction in the specified amount partial surrenders may have adverse tax consequences see tax considerations  transfers you may transfer amounts among the subaccounts and the fixed account subject to certain restrictions there is no limit on the number of transfers you can make between the subaccounts or to the fixed account the first six transfers during each contract year are free after the first six transfers we will assess a  transfer processing fee unused free transfers do not carry over to the next contract year we will deduct any transfer processing fee from the remaining contract value tax benefits we intend for the contract to satisfy the definition of life insurance under the internal revenue code therefore the death benefit generally should be excludable from the gross income of its recipient but may be subject to state and federal estate taxes similarly you should not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the contract value and therefore should not be taxed on increases in the contract value until you take out a loan or partial surrender surrender the contract or we pay the maturity benefit in addition transfers of contract value among the subaccounts andor the fixed account are not taxable transactions see

may not be available in all states additional rules and limits apply to these supplemental andor rider benefits please ask your registered representative for further information or contact the home office illustrations we may prepare for use in marketing and other materials tables to illustrate hypothetically how certain values under a contract change with investment performance over an extended period of time such tables illustrate how contract values cash surrender values and death benefits under a contract covering an insured of a given age would vary over time if planned premium payments were paid annually and the return on the assets in each of the funds were an assumed uniform gross annual rates actual returns will fluctuate over time and will be both positive and negative the actual values under the contract could be significantly different from those shown even if actual returns averaged the rates used in the illustrations but fluctuated over and under those averages throughout the years shown depending on the timing and degree of fluctuation the actual values could be substantially less than those shown and may under certain circumstances result in the lapse of the contract unless the owner pays more than the stated premium such illustrations show contract values based on both current charges and guaranteed charges  contract risks investment risk if you invest your contract value in one or more subaccounts then you will be subject to the risk that investment performance will be unfavorable and that the contract value will decrease in addition we deduct contract fees and charges from your contract value there is no minimum guaranteed contract value the contract value may decrease if the investment performance of the subaccounts to which contract value is allocated is negative or is not sufficiently positive to cover the charges deducted under the contract during times of poor investment performance these deductions will have an even greater impact on your contract value you could lose everything you invest if you allocate net premiums to the fixed account then we credit your fixed account value with a declared rate of interest you assume the risk that the rate may decrease although it will never be lower than a guaranteed minimum annual effective rate of  risk of lapse if the contract value is not enough to pay the monthly deduction when due the contract will terminate without value after a grace period the purpose of the grace period is to give you the chance to pay enough premiums to keep your contract in force if your contract does lapse you must pay the required amount before the end of the grace period the grace period is  days and starts when we send the notice since the value of amounts allocated to the variable account will vary according to the investment performance of the funds the specific amount of premiums required to prevent termination will also vary a lapse could result in adverse tax consequences tax risks in order to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law a contract must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code guidance as to how these requirements are to be applied is limited nevertheless we believe that contracts issued on a standard basis should satisfy the applicable requirements there is less guidance however with respect to contracts issued on a substandard basis and such contracts may not satisfy the applicable requirements in all circumstances particularly if you pay the full amount of premiums permitted under the contract depending on the total amount of premiums you pay the contract may be treated as a modified endowment contract under federal tax laws if a contract is treated as a modified endowment contract then surrenders withdrawals and loans under the contract will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent there are earnings in the contract in addition a  penalty tax may be imposed on surrenders withdrawals and loans taken before you reach age ½ if the contract is not a modified endowment contract then distributions generally will be treated first as a return of basis or investment in the contract and then as taxable income moreover loans will generally not be treated as distributions although the tax treatment of preferred loans is unclear finally neither distributions nor loans from a contract that is not a modified endowment contract are subject to the  penalty tax see tax considerations you should consult a qualified tax adviser for assistance in all contractrelated tax matters risk of increase in current fees and expenses certain fees and expenses are currently assessed at less than their maximum levels we may increase these current charges in the future up to the guaranteed maximum levels if fees and expenses are increased you may need to increase the amount andor frequency of premiums to keep the contract in force surrender and partial surrender risks during the first fifteen contract years we will deduct a surrender charge from the contract value if the contract is completely surrendered lapses or the specified amount is reduced including when a partial surrender reduces the specified amount an additional surrender charge and surrender charge period will apply to each portion of the contract resulting from a specified amount increase starting with the effective date of the increase under some circumstances the amount of the surrender charge during the first few contract years could result in a cash surrender value of zero you should purchase the contract only if you have the financial ability to keep it in force for a substantial period of time you should not purchase the contract if you intend to surrender all or part of the contract value in the near future we designed the contract to meet longterm financial goals the contract is not suitable as a shortterm investment even if you do not surrender your contract surrender charges may play a role in determining whether your contract will lapse because surrender charges affect the cash surrender value which is a measure we use to determine whether your contract will enter the grace period and possibly terminate see risk of lapse a surrender or partial surrender may have tax consequences see tax considerations loan risks a contract loan will affect your contract in several ways over time whether or not it is repaid because the investment results of the subaccounts may be less than or greater than the net interest rate credited on the amount transferred to the loan account securing the loan  your contract value by comparison to a contract under which no loan has been made will be less if the fixed account interest rate is less than the investment return of the applicable subaccounts and greater if the fixed account interest rate is higher than the investment return of the applicable subaccounts a contract loan increases the risk that the contract will terminate since a loan decreases the cash surrender value if the death benefit becomes payable while a contract loan is outstanding the loan balance will be deducted in calculating the death proceeds a loan may have tax consequences in addition if you surrender the contract or allow it to lapse while a contract loan is outstanding the amount of the loan to the extent it has not previously been taxed will be added to any amount you receive and taxed accordingly see tax considerations risk of frequent transfers we have policies and procedures that attempt to detect frequent large programmed or shortterm transfers among the subaccounts that may adversely affect other owners and persons with rights under the contracts we employ various means to try to detect such transfer activity but the detection and deterrence of harmful trading activity involves judgments that are inherently subjective our ability to detect such transfer activity may be limited by operational and technological systems as well as our ability to predict strategies employed by owners to avoid such detection accordingly there is no assurance that we will prevent all transfer activity that may adversely affect owners and other persons with interests under the contracts in addition we cannot guarantee that the funds will not be harmed by transfer activity related to other insurance companies andor retirement plans that may invest in the funds portfolio risks a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each fund portfolio may be found in each portfolio s prospectus please refer to the portfolios prospectuses for more information there is no assurance that any portfolio will achieve its stated investment objective fee table the following tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying owning and surrendering the contract the first table

of the last surviving insured regardless of the contracts investment performance provided that the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium requirement is met the guaranteed minimum death benefit option does not guarantee any additional insurance amount the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium is the amount which guarantees that the guaranteed minimum death benefit option will remain in effect the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium requirement is met if on each monthly anniversary day o the cumulative premiums paid equal or exceed the cumulative guaranteed minimum death benefit options premiums the amount of the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium is shown in the contract plus indebtedness where o the term the cumulative premiums paid means

benefit option is in default a day notice period begins on the day kansas city life mails the notice that the guaranteed minimum death benefit option is in default and the amount of premium required to maintain the guaranteed minimum death benefit option the default premium will be the amount by which the cumulative guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium plus indebtedness is greater than the cumulative paid premium the guaranteed minimum death benefit option will terminate if sufficient premium is not paid by the end of the notice period if the policy contains any additional insurance amount coverage or any optional benefit riders then in addition to testing the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium requirement as outlined above the contract value will be tested to ensure that the policy is funded at a sufficient level to support the additional insurance amount or other optional benefit riders on each monthly anniversary day the cash surrender value will be tested to determine if it is sufficient to cover the monthly deduction if not a day notice period begins on the day kansas city life mail notice of the default premium amount the default premium will be equal to the payment which would be sufficient to provide a cash surrender value equal to three monthly deductions the additional insurance amount coverage and other optional benefit riders will be removed from the contract if payment at least equal to the default premium is not received by the end of the notice period there is no charge for this option during the first  contract years beginning in contract year  a monthly charge per  of specified amount at issue will apply the guaranteed minimum death benefit option is not available for coverage option b contracts for contracts on which the

benefit option has been elected the specified amount is guaranteed to remain in force as long as the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium requirement is met on each monthly anniversary day however while failure to meet the guaranteed minimum death benefit option premium requirement will cause the guaranteed minimum death benefit option to terminate such failure will not necessarily cause the contract to lapse riders are not guaranteed by the guaranteed minimum death benefit option and will terminate if the cash surrender value becomes negative if the guaranteed minimum death benefit option has not been elected or has been removed a grace period starts if the cash surrender value on a monthly anniversary day will not cover the monthly deduction a premium sufficient to

determine monthly anniversary day the monthly deduction consists of  monthly expense charges  cost of insurance charges and  any optional benefit charges as described below the monthly deduction is deducted from the variable accounts and fixed account pro rata on the basis of the portion of contract value in each account on the monthly anniversary day monthly expense charge the monthly expense charge is made up of two parts  a charge of  per month for the first five contract years  a monthly expense charge of  plus  per  of total sum insured per month for all contract years the monthly expense charge reimburses kansas city life for expenses incurred in the administration of the contracts and the variable account such expenses include but are not limited to underwriting and issuing the contract confirmations annual reports and account statements maintenance of contract records maintenance of variable account records administrative personnel costs mailing costs data processing costs legal fees accounting fees filing fees the costs of other services necessary for contract owner servicing and all accounting valuation regulatory and updating requirements the monthly expense charge is guaranteed not to increase cost of insurance charge this charge compensates kansas city life for the expense of providing insurance coverage kansas city life may make a profit from this charge any profit may be used to finance distribution expenses the charge depends on a number of variables and therefore will vary from contract to contract and from monthly anniversary day to monthly anniversary day for any contract the cost of insurance on a monthly anniversary day is calculated by multiplying the current cost of insurance rate for the insureds by the net amount at risk for that monthly anniversary day the net amount at risk on a monthly anniversary day is the difference between the death benefit see coverage options page  discounted with one month of interest and the contract value as calculated on that monthly anniversary day before the cost of insurance charge is taken the interest rate used to discount the death benefit is the monthly equivalent of  per year the cost of insurance rate for a contract on a monthly anniversary day is based on the insureds age sex number of completed contract years total sum insured and risk class and therefore varies from time to time kansas city life currently places insureds in the following classes based on underwriting standard tobacco user standard nontobacco user preferred nontobacco user and preferred tobacco user the insureds may be placed in a substandard risk class which involves a higher mortality risk than the standard tobacco user or standard nontobacco user classes kansas city life places the insureds in a risk class when the contract is given underwriting approval based on kansas city lifes underwriting of the application when an increase in additional insurance amount is requested kansas city life conducts underwriting before approving the increase to determine the risk class that will apply to the increase if the risk class for the increase has lower cost of insurance rates than the existing risk class the lower rates will apply to the entire specified amount if the risk class for the increase has higher cost of insurance rates than the existing class the higher rates will apply only to the increase in additional insurance amount and the existing risk class will continue to apply to the existing additional insurance amount kansas city life guarantees that the cost of insurance rates used to calculate the monthly cost of insurance charge will not exceed the maximum cost of insurance rates set forth in the contract the guaranteed rates for standard and preferred risk classes are based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables male or female smoker or nonsmoker mortality rates  cso tables the guaranteed rates for substandard classes are based on multiples of or additives to the  cso tables kansas city lifes current cost of insurance rates may be less than the guaranteed rates that are set forth in the contract current cost of insurance rates will be determined based on kansas city lifes expectations as to future mortality experience these rates may change from time to time cost of insurance rates whether guaranteed or current for one or both insureds in a nontobacco user standard class are lower than rates for one or both insureds of the same age and sex in a tobacco user standard class cost of insurance rates whether guaranteed or current for one or both insureds in a nontobacco user or tobacco user standard risk class are lower than rates for one or both insureds of the same age sex and tobacco user class in a substandard risk class guaranteed minimum death benefit option charge there is no charge for the guaranteed minimum death benefit option in the first ten contract years beginning in contract year  the charge will be  per  on a current basis and  per  on a guaranteed basis this charge will be based on the specified amount and will be deducted monthly reduced charges for eligible groups the charges otherwise applicable may be reduced with respect to contracts issued to a class of associated individuals or to a trustee employer or similar entity where kansas city life anticipates that the sales to the members of the class will result in lower than normal sales or administrative expenses these reductions will be made in accordance with our rules in effect at the time of the application for a contract the factors kansas city life will consider in determining the eligibility of a particular group for reduced charges and the level of the reduction are as follows the nature of the association and it organizational framework the method by which sales will be made to the members of the class the facility with which premiums will be collected from the associated individuals and the association capabilities with respect to administrative tasks the anticipated persistency of the contract the size of the class of associated individuals and the number of years it has been in existence and any other such circumstances which justify a reduction in sales or administrative expenses any reduction will be reasonable and will apply uniformly to all prospective contract purchases in the class and will not be unfairly discriminatory to the interest of any contract holder supplemental andor rider benefits the following optional benefits are available and may be added to the
