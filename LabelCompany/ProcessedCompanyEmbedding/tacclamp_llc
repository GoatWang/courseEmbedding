clamp llc was founded by a military veteran who had an idea while acting as crew chief of a chinook helicopter there was always an issue with storage and removal of bags and weapons during loading and unloading of the aircraft especially at night and while under pressure the tactical utility clamp was created to allow for extreme versatility in location and placement within the aircraft while ensuring a secure hold the quick release attachment loop allows for even quicker removal when the time calls project image gallery project video galleryproject case study     this project was brought to ram after another designer could not meet the clients requirements and ultimately abandoned the project this gave us a small starting point but it was ultimately an open book on how to make the clients idea truly work it was decided that the design must allow for large scale manufacturing  units targeting metal stamping and plastic injection molding for final components the designs would also be used for a full utility patent targeting all major functions of the product      first stage prototyping was all sla plastic printed components to prove out function at the lowest costs early revisions incorporated external linkages which proved to be very strong and passed testing requirements the prototype was tested to the breaking point and various components were modified and optimized during redesigns second stage prototyping included sls nylon printed waterjet and steel coated sla plastic printed components which allowed for increased function and strength again the clamp was tested beyond its comfort zone and while still incorporating plastic printed parts proved to be very strong even though we were finally able to break the lower jaw      a final redesign was done at this point and the external linkages were transformed and pulled inside the body which decreased overall size and number of components on the bom the final prototyping stage was  stainless steel metal waterjet components with sls nylon printed parts for the top pads and proved to be extremely strong during testing it was found that the clamp produced a tremendous amount of internal pressure and per design transferred into the main slider bolt and lower plate causing deflection a simple increase in bolt size which also increases shear strength by a major factor and double staking the lower plate gave us all the strength needed with only a small design change and no additional part numbers on the bom after minor marketing changes adding logos and other aesthetic improvements the design was finalized and moved to production preparations        currently the tactical clamp by tac clamp llc is being perused for licensing and manufacturing agreements  last project projects
