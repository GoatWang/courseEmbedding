classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase order and the price that rosland capital actually pays for the products purchased

capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase
