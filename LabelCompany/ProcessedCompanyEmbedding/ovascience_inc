worldwide the company’s treatments focus on addressing the following increasing live birth rates and reducing the number of ivf cycles by improving egg health we believe we may increase the number of higher quality embryos resulting from an ivf cycle and in so doing reduce the ivf cycles required reducing the incidence of multiple births ovascience’s eggpc technology may allow for the transfer of fewer embryos per cycle and as a result lower the incidence of multiple births and the associated complications lowering the overall cost of ivf if we reduce the number of ivf cycles required for a live birth and reduce the incidence of multiple births we believe our treatments also may lower the overall costs associated with ivf reducing the need for hormonal hyperstimulation currently in preclinical development the ovaturesm treatment could reduce or possibly eliminate the need for hormonal hyperstimulation for the maturation of fertilizable eggs this website contains information

done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when

stock alertsno spam no hidden fees unsubscribe anytime biotech ovascience inc nasdaqovas is a potentially rewarding biotech play by chris sandburg posted on june   share tweet share share email comments ovascience inc nasdaqovas is an interesting one at the end of last week the company traded for just  dollars a share coming off the back of a longterm depreciation that saw the company lose more than  of its valuation subsequent to  highs it’s had a couple of fresh ceo hires throughout its life to date but hasn’t had much luck in terms of marketing its portfolio of fertilization aid products globally over the last few months however certain steps have been taken to turn things around and as action this week demonstrates it looks as though these steps are starting to have the desired effect at last count the company traded for  a share – a more than  appreciation on it end of last week pricing it’s nothing spectacular and it’s far far from a full recovery but it’s a start a start that is and we think there’s plenty more runroom left on this one with this thesis driven by the fact that from the perspective of risk reward ratios it’s incredibly attractive here is what we are looking at for those familiar with this company’s legacy operations namely its augment fertility boosting product the easiest thing would be to forget what you know as per the recent pivot the company is now focusing on the development of two new fertility products altogether with one serving as the primary and one as a sort of secondary followup pipeline asset it may offload augment near term which could mean a nice capital injection but operationally it’s discontinued going forward the majority of this company’s valuation is rooted in the former of these two assets what’s called ovaprime last week ovascience announced that it had completed enrollment in an ongoing clinical study of the treatment it’s a tolerability study right now designed to assess the safety of ovaprime in women with either primary ovarian insufficiency poi or poor ovarian response por to explain briefly how it works women have what are called egg precursor eggpcsm cells in the lining of their ovaries which are a sort of immature egg cell with ovaprime ovascience is attempting to convert the cells into mature and fertile egg cells and – in doing so – overcome issues associated with the two above conditions poi and por in female patients from a nearterm catalyst perspective we should get data from at least  of these patients hitting press before the end of  the company also expects to complete biopsies in all  patients by the end of this year and have topline available on all  by the end of the first half  fertility science is an incredibly large market it’s also one that is crying out for new options if ovascience can prove this treatment’s safety as part of this ongoing study it can carry forward into an efficacy study and that’s where the real catalysts will come as per a fresh ceo appointment early this month the guy at the helm is christopher kroeger who is perhaps best well known for his role overseeing the sale of cardioxyl to bristolmyers squibb nysebmy for  billion in  he took a sabbatical then in his own words in relation to wanting to find a new biotech ceo role “looked at a number of companies a key focus was good people and science that i think is transformational” he chose ovascience this is as good an endorsement as any in our eyes and his compensation at the company is very much tied to ovascience’s success as illustrated by this inducement grant announced earlier this week perhaps most interestingly aside from the science that is is that this company recently restructured and freed up around  million of operating capital annually combined with cash on hand it’s this will see it through first quarter  removing any near to medium term valuation risk for shareholders looking to pick up an exposure at current levels sure it’s not a great idea to try and catch a falling knife but in this instance this company really could be at an inflection point and – as a speculative exposure – is well worth a look we will be updating our subscribers as soon as
