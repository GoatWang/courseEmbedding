classicbytdbon march  verified purchasetheres a lot of bogus negative reviews of this guitar the  gibson les paul deluxe on the internet but let me be the first to tell you gibson knew what they were doing with this guitar it looks like a centerfold plays like a dream and sounds amazing theres something about the way the new wider neck fits your hand combined with the super low action of the strings that make it surprisingly easy to play and i swear my playing immediately got more accurate after about an hour of letting the muscle memory in my hands get used to the new neck the new mini humbuckers are capable of sounding like anything from country twang or chuck berry chime to pete townsend humbuckers or led zeppelin snarl the new gforce built in tuner works fantastic if you take the  or  minutes it takes to read the directions and is much faster and more covenient than the snark i use on my other guitars ive got a  strat an american deluxe strat and a memphis dot  all of which i love but my new  gold top les paul deluxe looks cooler plays easier and sounds better than any of em i woul give it  stars if i could comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to

ratings rate and review this product read  gibson lefthanded les paul traditional electric guitar with case reviews zzounds has verified that this customer bought this product from us great lefty gibson sound classic les paul tone this guitar sounds awesome everybody in my band is blown away by its tone cuts through in the mid and high range very well with a tight low bottom end excellent tonal balance feature its old school les paul i do not like the plastic tuners ease of use this guitar sounds great through a evh  or through a  watt practice amp plays excellent no learning curve quality made in the usa gibson guitars will last a life time not sure about the plastic tuners and pick guard value i was skeptical about the price verses quality after receiving the guitar that went away manufacturer support never had a reason to contact the wow factor every guitar player should have gibson les paul love them hate them it shouldnt matter i am not the biggest les paul fan on the planet however i believe this guitar is going to make me a huge les paul fan very thick heavy tone overall excellent guitar before i even plugged it in i knew i had a winner a guitar that sounds that great before even being plugged into an amp has to sound good and it does i own several guitars evh ibanez esp ltd ovation they all have likes and dislikes the gibson les paul traditional is just a big heavy tone monster i am not going to bore you with a bunch of details on the gibson it is heavy in weight for a guitar compared to others i switched to a padded strap and that helps i can stand at rehersal for five hours and be comfortable the tone i get from this guitar is priceless i got a very good deal on it from zzsounds i am very happy with the purchase style of music rockmetal did you find this review helpful yes no thanks for your opinion close xthank you your vote has been counted could you briefly tell us why the review was or was not helpfulsubmit zzounds has verified that this customer bought this product from us from a jackson user sound the sound of this guitar is not as bright as i expected but it did give very good and clear clean tones the heavier riffs sound good to with the right volume and amp sustain was a little less than i expected but a quick adjustment of the height of the pickups fixed that the main problem is that once in tune it buzzed i had to make some adjustments but then it was fine the pickups are definitely the most versatile i have heard to go through a variety of styles feature its pretty much what you would expect its a les paul so dont expect any bells and whistles the volume and tone knobs are very responsive and just a little tweak makes a difference although they go in reverse direction to what im used to for some reason the main thing i want to say here is that the body is no where near as heavy as i expected it is supposed to be weight relieved not chambered but its not that much heavier to what im used to if you are not used to a les paul neck get ready to adjust its easier to me to chord but much harder to soloagain im used to usa and japan jacksons so i knew this coming in however i definitely like the feel of the guitars neck and the way it conforms to my hands just fyi the binding is more of a cream than a white and the case made in canada is awesome ease of use again the neck and the upper fret access will be the biggest adjustment quality first off im a little biased because i dont mind paying a little more to keep american workers employed but i did have one complaint on the construction everything is where it should be and the fretwork tuners finish pickups wood and case were all fantastic but there are  places where a razor blade cut into the binding on top and it is noticeable this should not have been missed by any inspection checklist it stands out everything else was top notch besides the strap buttonsway too small value even though i know i will get slammed maybe cause im a ten year playing hobbyist and not a professional i cant honestly say that there is a  difference in this guitar and an epi custom i owned a difference yes but not that much of one other than the residual value however this is definitely a great buy over the standard  manufacturer support havent dealt with them the wow factor the fact that you own something that will outlast you and appreciate in value is enough for me again i was impressed with the versatility of the tones the finish ebony and the tightness of the guitar i was definitely wowed that it wasnt as heavy as what i expected and i was wowed in a bad way on the cuts on the binding the other appealing thing about this guitar is the price point is perfect as standards are too expensive fenders are a different breed and usa jacksons are nuts
