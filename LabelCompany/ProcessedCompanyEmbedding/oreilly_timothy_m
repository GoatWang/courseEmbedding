investments suggest its building a developercentric suite of tools for the cloud by timothy m obrien  tobrien  timothy m obrien  october   have you ever seen salesforce’s “no software” graphic it’s the word “software” surrounded by a circle with a red line through it here’s a picture of the related and dancing “no software” mascot now if you consider yourself a developer this is a bit threatening no imagine sitting at a salesforce event in  in chicago while salesforcecom’s ceo marc benioff swiftly works an entire room of business users into an antisoftware frenzy i was there to learn about forcecom and i’ll summarize the message i understood four years ago as “not only can companies benefit from salesforcecom they also don’t have to hire developers” the message resonated with the audience salesforce had been using this approach for a decade don’t buy software you have to support maintain and hire developers to customize use our softwareasaservice saas instead  the reality behind salesforce’s trajectory at the time was that it too needed to provide a platform for custom development salesforce’s dilemma they needed developers this “no software” message was enough for the vast majority of the smalltomediumsized business smb market but to engage with companies at the largest scale you need apis and you need to be able to work with developers at the time in  salesforce was making moves toward the developer community first there was apex then there was forcecom in  i evaluated forcecom and while capable it didn’t strike me as something that would appeal to most developers outside of existing salesforce customers  salesforce was aiming at the corporate developers building software atop competing stacks like oracle  while there were several attempts to sell it as such it wasn’t a standalone product or framework  in my opinion no developer would assess forcecom and opt to use it as the next development platform this  techcrunch article announcing the arrival of salesforce’s developerasaservice daas platform serves as a reminder of what salesforce had in mind they were still moving forward with an antisoftware message for the business while continuing to make moves into the developer space salesforce built a capable platform looking back at forcecom it felt more like an even more constrained version of google app engine in other words capable and scalable but at the time a bit constraining for the general developer population don’t get me wrong forcecom wasn’t a business failure by any measure they have an impressive client list even today but what they didn’t achieve was traction and awareness among the developer community read more… comment  google’s spanner is all about time did google just prove the industry wrong early thoughts on the spanner database by timothy m obrien  tobrien  timothy m obrien  october   in case you missed it google research published another one of “those” significant research papers — a paper like the bigtable paper from  that had ramifications for the entire industry that paper was one of the opening volleys in the nosql movement   google’s new paper is about a distributed relational database called spanner that was a follow up to a presentation from earlier in the year about a new database for adwords called f   if you recall that presentation revealed google’s migration of adwords from mysql to a new database that supported sql and hierarchical schemas — two ideas that buck the trend from relational databases meet spanner this new database spanner is a database unlike anything we’ve seen   it’s a database that embraces acid sql and transactions that can be distributed across thousands of nodes spanning multiple data centers across multiple regions  the paper dwells on two main features that define this database schematized semirelational tables — a hierarchical approach to grouping tables that allows spanner to colocate related data into directories that can be easily stored replicated locked and managed on what google calls spanservers    they have a modified sql syntax that allows for the data to be interleaved and the paper mentions some changes to support columns encoded with protobufs “reification of clock uncertainty” — this is the real emphasis of the paper    the missing link in relational database scalability was a strong emphasis on coordination backed by a serious attempt to minimize time uncertainty  in google’s new globalscale database the variable that matters is epsilon — time uncertainty   google has achieved very low overhead ms introduced by spanner in this paper for datacenters at ms network distance for readwrite rw transactions that span us east coast and us west coast data centers separated by around ms of network time by creating a system that facilitates distributed transactions bound only by network distance measured in milliseconds and time uncertainty epsilon read more… comments  dna the perfect backup medium dna storage could change the way we store and archive information by timothy m obrien  tobrien  timothy m obrien  august   it wasn’t enough for dr george church to help gilbert “discover” dna sequencing  years ago create the foundations for genomics create the personal genome project drive down the cost of sequencing  and start humanity down the road of synthetic biology no that wasn’t enough he and his team decided to publish an easily understood scientific paper ““nextgeneration information storage in dna“ that promises to change the way we store and archive information while this technology may take years to perfect it provides a roadmap toward an energy efficient archival storage medium with a host of builtin advantages the paper demonstrates the feasibility of using dna as a storage medium with a theoretical capacity of  exabytes per gram an exabyte is  million terabytes now before you throw away your massive raid  cluster and purchase a series of sequencing machines know that dna storage appears to be very high latency also know that church yuan gao and sriram kosuri are not yet writing  exabytes of data they’ve started with a more modest goal of writing church’s recent book on genomics to a  mb “bitstream” here’s an excerpt from the paper we converted an htmlcoded draft of a book that included  words  jpg images and  javascript program into a  megabit bitstream we then encoded these bits onto  nt oligonucleotides oligos each encoding a bit data block nt a bit address specifying the location of the data block in the bit stream nt and flanking nt common sequences for amplification and sequencing the oligo library was synthesized by inkjet printed highfidelity dna microchips to read the encoded book we amplified the library by limitedcycle pcr and then sequenced on a single lane of an illumina hiseq if you know anything about filesystems this is an amazing paragraph they’ve essentially defined a new standard for filesystem inodes on dna each bit block has a bit descriptor they then read this dna bitstream by using something called polymerase chain reaction pcr this is important because it means that reading this information involves generating millions of copies of the data in a format that has been proven to be durable this biological “backup system” has replication capabilities “builtin” not just that but this replication process has had billions of years of reliability data available read more… comment clojure’s advantage immediate feedback with repl chas emerick on how clojure can make a
