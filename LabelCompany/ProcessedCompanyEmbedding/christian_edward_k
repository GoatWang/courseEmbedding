theology january   gcconspiracy age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  i came across this book because it was mentioned in lee strobels case for series and i have to admit i am very disappointed the premise for this book is great i was very excited to read the correspondence but i just do not see boyds open theology as being biblically sound its a shame because this book had such potential but i simply could not stomach the watered down picture of god that was painted i will not be recommending this to anyone was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate floyd johnson upstate ny age  gender male  stars out of  apologetics overview january   floyd johnson upstate ny age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  letters have long been a means for those who are a part of the christian church to communicate truth over half the new testament are letters the letters of augustine luther and wesley are all studied by scholars to help better understand these leaders of the church many have been introduced to the formal study of theology and apologetics by reading c s lewis screwtape letters in  greg boyd contributed a set of letters between his father and himself boyds father had given up on the church and faith years ago  perhaps it was a position that was cemented when his wife died leaving him to raise his children as a single parent over the years the resentment the anger and the confusion had grown  to the point that as the book begins he is not certain about what he does believe though he feel fairly certain about what he does not believe it is at that point that dr boyd and his father begin a two years correspondence concerning the major issues the unbeliever has when he or she considers christ as lord and savior the compiles this correspondence topically and somewhat chronologically issues are address one by one  using history philosophy and scripture the answers are accurate and well thought out though rarely getting heady or unintelligible i have two concerns about a book of this caliber that is now entering its th edition the first is the lack of documentation with very few exceptions the author does not provide references for scripture whether quoted directly from an english translation or merely a paraphrase written on the fly by the author the same is true for statements made from third party sources i can understand why these were not part of the original correspondence but as the book enters its th edition it would make sense to add the references  even while clearly noting that they were added to the original letters years after they were written the second concern is that a book that is entering it th edition provides no path for further study again though not part of the original written correspondence it would seem important to guide the reader in discovering additional resources that explain the ideas discussed in the book the addition of a set of discussion question covering each topic does help the reader in processing the ideas  but provides not guidance in better understanding the history philosophy or scriptures that support those ideas the book would make a great textbook on apologetics with the addition of references and suggestions for further study in a classroom these missing elements can be provided by the instructor but the reader is at a loss if the book is being read without the direction of an experienced teacher but even with those flaws the book still serves as an excellent tool for evangelism as the author makes clear by the end of the correspondence ed boyd dr boyds father did come to faith it has served the same purpose in the lives of others it will continue to be so in the lives who read it in the future this review is based on an electronic copy of the book provided by the publisher was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate displaying items  of  page  of   next ask a question▼▲ have a

of mairlandclere in cumberland and brother of fletcher christian q v of the mutiny of the bounty the family of christian curwen of cumberland was nearly connected with him and he had been described as a faraway cousin of the first lord ellenborough he graduated at st johns college cambridge taking his degree of ba in  when he was third wrangler and second chancellors medallist and that of ma in  these distinctions combined with the fact that he was members prizeman in  ampbr justified his election to a fellowship at st johns college in the latter year a prize which he held until  he is stated in hardwickes preston p  to have been the master of hawkshead free granunar school but this could only have been for a short time as he entered himself at grays inn on  july  and was called to the bar on  jan  for some time he went the northern circuit but he disappointed the high expectations of future distinction which had been formed from his university career and gradually sank so low as to become the subject of practical jokes on the nomination of francis annesley then master of downing college cambridge he obtained the post of professor of common law and by a grace of that university the title of professor of laws of england was conferred upon him on  nov  christian was for many years one of the counsel in the longcontested case between the university and the heirs of sir jacob

candidate for the position of assessor to the vicechancellor but lost the election by  votes to  he obtained however the place of professor of general polity and laws of england in the east india

contest in the course of which the competitors came to blows he was declared on a scrutiny to have been beaten by one vote his last preferment was the chiefjusticeship of the isle of ely a preferment which was abolished in november  and this poet of the annual value of l was conferred upon him by dr yorke the then occupant of the see christian died at downing college cam bridge on  march  as was wittily remarked in the fiill vigour of his incapacity his connection lord ellenborough was equally emphatic in condemnation on one occasion a very doubtful nisi prius decision was cited before that sarcastic judge and the question who ruled that was met with the answer the chief justice of the isle of ely the peer thereupon exclaimed that christian was only fit to rule — a copybook his literary publications were numerous and some of them showed considerable research into the depths of antiquarian law the earliest was  an examination of precedents and principles    that an impeachment is determined by a dissolution of parliament  this was followed by   a dissertation showing that the house of lords in cases of judicature are bound by precisely the same rules of evidence as are observed by all other courts   nd ed  his edition with notes and additions  of blackstones commentaries on the laws of england appeared in four volumes s and was often reissued down to  the successive editions bringing the editor considerable gain to the minutes of the proceedings on the courtmartial held at portsmouth august   on the bounty mutineers he added  an appendix purporting to give a full account of the causes of the mutiny which evoked a reply from admiral bligh in  he published  a vindication of the right of the universities of great britain to a copy of every new publication the second edition appearing in  end the third in  down to the former date it had been considered to rest with the publishers discretion whether under the statutes for the security of copyright copies of all publications should be sent to other libraries than the british museum but in consequence of christians action the university of cambridge stepped forward to enforce on its own behalf and that of

invitation ed could write with any questions on christianity and his son would offer a responseletters from a skeptic contains this special correspondence the letters tackle some of todays toughest challenges facing christianity includingdo all nonchristians go to hell how can we believe a man rose from the dead why is the world so full of suffering how do we know the bible was divinely inspired

game or what  feb   after perusing the chapter heads i went to the study guide and worked back sampling the text though it may be unjustified i couldnt help thinking this could be a real con job doesnt it seem more than likely that the letters were intended for publication from the beginning so the conclusion was foregone the book would not have been published if the father hadnt been born again shallow at best an honest exchange of questions and answers re christianity  jan   this is an incredible book i have read it and then bought numerous copies to give away to family and friends the exchange of correspondence between the author and his father pulls no punches nothing is sugarcoated the author gives well thought out and biblically sound answers to an apparently well educated father who has very legitimate questions regarding the christian faith this is an excellent book for serious searchers  foundations of faith   dec   this is an excellent book for all those who like the challenge of asking many questions about their basic christian convictions the authors father the skeptic asked many important questions about the nature of god the problem of evil human freedom and sufering the bible heaven and hell sin etc the son tries to answer these complex questions and one might not always agree with his explanations but they do provide further food for thought letters from a skeptic will make you think and may result in some lively discussions with fellow believers agnostics atheists and members of other faiths wonderful read  nov   i would recommend this book for everyone the content of this book asks questions that every christian and nonchristian have asked of god down to earth answers are given it is not preachy it does distiguish the difference between religion and christianity wonderful and insightful  dont waste your time  sep   a friend gave me this book after i had complained about the shack and how i felt the ultimate question in the shack was never answered i deemed the question to be why does god allow bad things to happen to good people well at least i didnt waste my money purchasing this bookthe format utilized is as old as time itself have a dialog with someone where softball questions are posed to the other person and the other person then gives the answer that will change the mind of the original personin this case the senior boydand never up with any refuting comments of what his son as just said but rather give a milk toast response in the following letterwhat would have made this a very intersting response is if some one like robert m price or burton mack or earl doherty had responded to the phd son now you have a discussion and what you wouldnt have had is dr boyds halfbaked ideas on his verson of what god is or on what the scriptures meanothers have commented particularly those that have given one star ratings that his scholarship on the bible and his interpretation of the bible leaves a lot to be desired i agree but for different reasonsthank god is was only  pages in length dont buy it not worth the time and energy  write your own review about letters from a skeptic wstudy guide customer support
