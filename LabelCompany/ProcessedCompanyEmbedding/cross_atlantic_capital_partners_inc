claim construction is meant to be a straightforward exercise where the court interprets the words of a claim affording them their plain and ordinary meaning as informed by a review of the intrinsic record facebook’s proposed constructions do just that for each term facebook has provided the plain meaning and then explained how that meaning is supported by the specification of us patent no  “’ patent” the resulting definitions are clear and concise and will assist the trier of fact in understanding the issues in this case for most of the terms the constructions proposed by the two parties appear to be relatively similar however while similar in content many of xacp’s proposed constructions violate basic principles of claim construction noticing this facebook offered to meet and confer with xacp to try to arrive at constructions both parties could agree with that also comply with the tenets of claim construction established by the federal circuit xacp did not respond to facebook’s overtures as a result the majority of xacp’s constructions violate at least one of the following three cardinal rules of claim construction  the accused product must not be considered in construing the claim terms yet xacp asks the court to do so  limitations from the specification must not be imported into the claims yet xacp’s constructions incorporate direct quotes from the preferred embodiments recited in the specification and  claim construction should provide clarity and certainty to the claims not render them more vague and amorphous as many of xacp’s proposals do facebook respectfully requests that its straightforward consistent constructions be adopted paloalto  v k  ii background facebook is a leading social networking website that connects people with those who work study and live around them facebook was established in  and has grown rapidly to service tens of millions of users throughout the world facebook’s success and sustained growth have occurred due to the company’s own efforts and innovations which were completely independent of the patent at issue in this case in fact facebook had no knowledge or awareness of the ’ patent prior to the filing of this action on july   crossatlantic capital partners inc “xacp” on the other hand is not a technology company and has no product of its own it is an investment company that allegedly acquired rights in the patent as the result of a failed investment in a company called ikimbo the ’ patent has  claims all of which xacp has asserted against facebook the patent began as an application for an online gaming system filed on september   that application did not disclose anything about creating communities it was transformed into the present patent through a major revision of the specification more specifically the applicants first disclosed a community creation system in a continuationinpart application filed on february   almost all of the text in the ’ patent that is cited by both parties to support the claim terms briefed herein was added in february  iii legal principles claim construction is an issue of law to be determined by the court see markman v westview instruments inc  fd   fed cir  en banc aff’d  us   there is a wellestablished body of authority providing guidance to courts on the permissible sources for determining the meaning of disputed claim terms that body of law also contains a number of prohibitions that courts must abide by to avoid error the following is a paloalto  v k  synopsis of the claim construction framework as well as a list of prohibitions of which xacp’s proposed constructions run afoul a general tenets of claim construction it is wellestablished that the words of a claim “are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning” vitronics corp v conceptronic inc  fd   fed cir  that ordinary and customary meaning “is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention ie as of the effective filing date of the patent application” phillips v awh corp  fd   fed cir  en banc texas digital sys inc v telegenix inc  fd   fed cir  accordingly the claim construction process begins with a review of the sources of interpretation a person of ordinary skill would reference – the plain meaning and the intrinsic record phillips  fd at   intrinsic record the intrinsic record is made up of three sources the claims of the patent the patent specification and the prosecution history “such intrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language” liquid dynamics corp v vaughan co inc  fd   fed cir  quoting vitronics  fd at  a the plain meaning and the claims themselves “in construing claims we search for the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term to a person of ordinary skill in the art” lb plastics inc v amerimax home products inc  fd   fed cir  the claim language itself provides the primary guidance the context of the surrounding words of a claim must also be considered in determining the ordinary and customary meaning of a particular term actv inc v walt disney co  fd paloalto  v k    fed cir  further “because claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent the usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims” phillips  fd at  see also rexnord corp v laitram corp  fd   fed cir  cvibeta ventures inc v tura lp  fd   fed cir  finally analysis of the differences between claims can be useful for determining the meaning of particular claim terms phillips  fd at  citing laitram corp v rexnord inc  fd   fed cir  b the specification the claims are not to be considered in isolation they “must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part” markman  fd at  the specification “is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis usually it is dispositive it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term” vitronics  fd at  while a claim term is to be given its ordinary meaning the patentee may use the specification to give a term a special definition that differs from that ordinary meaning but only if it does so clearly and explicitly see phillips  fd at  the specification may also “reveal an intentional disclaimer or disavowal of claim scope by the inventor in that instance as well the inventor has dictated the correct claim scope and the inventor’s intention as expressed in the specification is regarded as dispositive” id citing scimed life sys inc v advanced cardiovascular sys inc  fd   fed cir  finally courts “should also consider the patent’s prosecution history if it is in evidence” markman  fd at   extrinsic sources courts may also rely on extrinsic sources – sources external to the patent and prosecution history such as dictionaries and treatises see phillips  fd at  dictionaries and paloalto  v k  treatises can be useful in claim construction for the purpose of allowing courts “‘to better understand the underlying technology’ and the way in which one of skill in the art might use the claim terms” id at  citing vitronics  fd at  n these sources may be used “if the court deems it helpful in determining ‘the true meaning of language used in the patent claims’” id citing markman  fd at  b prohibitions in claim construction xacp has attempted to induce the court to violate several established prohibitions of claim construction by asking the court to  construe the claim terms with reference to the accused product  import limitations from the specification into the claims and  adopt openended vague nondefinitions of claim terms that would obscure rather than clarify the scope of the asserted claims each of these improper practices is discussed in the sections below  the claims may not be construed by reference to the accused product in its claim construction brief xacp repeatedly asks the court to construe the terms of the ’ patent with reference to the features of the accused facebookcom website the federal circuit has expressly and emphatically rejected such a practice as this court recently observed “one form of extrinsic evidence that a court may not use to supply limitations to the patent claim language is the accused device” heraeus electronite co v midwest instrument co inc no   wl  at  ed pa  padova j emphasis in original accord neomagic corp v trident microsystems inc  fd   fed cir  “it is well settled that claims may not be construed by reference to the accused device” “a claim is construed in the light of the claim language the other claims the prior art the prosecution history and the specification not in light of the accused device” sri intern v matsushita elec corp of america  fd   fed cir  en banc emphasis in original “it is paloalto  v k  only after the claims have been construed without reference to the accused device that the claims as so construed are applied to the accused device to determine infringement” id emphasis in original even the case cited by xacp for the proposition that the court should consider the accused facebook product in construing the claims expressly rejects that assertion this court of course repeats its rule that ‘claims may not be construed with reference to the accused device’ citations omitted as noted earlier that rule posits that a court may not use the accused product or process as a form of extrinsic evidence to supply limitations for patent claim language thus the rule forbids a court from tailoring a claim construction to fit the dimensions of the accused product or process and to reach a preconceived judgment of infringement or noninfringement in other words it forbids biasing the claim construction process to exclude or include specific features of the accused product or process wilson sporting goods co v hillerich  bradsby co  fd   fedcir  it is only permissible to consider the accused product during claim construction in limited circumstances where such reference is needed solely to determine which aspects of a claim should be construed id pall corp v hemasure inc  fd   fed cir  “although the construction of the claim is independent of the device charged with infringement it is convenient for the court to concentrate on those aspects of the claim whose relation to the accused device is in dispute” scripps clinic  research found v genentech inc  fd   fed cir  “of course the particular accused product or process is kept in mind for it is efficient to focus on the construction of only the disputed elements or limitations of the claims” accordingly all portions of xacp’s claim construction brief that ask the court to refer to the accused facebook website in construing the disputed terms of the ’ patent should be disregarded see xacp br at    paloalto  v k   importing limitations from the specification into the claims is forbidden importing limitations from the specification into the claims has been referred to by the federal circuit as “one of the cardinal sins of patent law” phillips  fd at  quoting scimed life sys  fd at  patent specifications often describe very specific embodiments of an invention as is the case with the ’ patent the federal circuit has repeatedly warned against confining the claims of the patent to those specific embodiments see eg phillips  fd at  nazomi communications inc v arm holdings plc  fd   fed cir  liebelflarsheim co v medrad inc  fd   fed cir  teleflex inc v ficosa north america corp  fd   fed cir  “although courts should consider the specification when construing a claim a court cannot add ‘limitations appearing only in the specification’” heraeus electronite  wl  at  quoting electro med sys sa v cooper life sciences inc  fd   fed cir  the federal circuit has recognized that there is a distinction between using the specification to interpret a claim which is permissible and importing a limitation from the specification into the claim which is prohibited see phillips  fd at  “there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification” id “to help locate this ‘fine line’ the federal circuit has reminded courts that they ‘look to the specification to ascertain the meaning of the claim term as it is used by the inventor in the context of the entirety of his invention and not merely to limit a claim term’” heraeus electronite  wl  at  in this case xacp repeatedly asks the court to commit the cardinal sin of importing limitations from the specification into the claims many of xacp’s proposed constructions contain language quoted verbatim from preferred embodiments described in the specification paloalto  v k  despite an express prohibition on the practice from the federal circuit see eg xacp’s proposed constructions for “community” “creation transmission” “published” “registered user” “subscribe” “community fields” “user fields” and “vendor fields” further it is clear that the ’ patentee intended the embodiments set forth in the ’ patent specification to be exemplary only not limiting indeed in many cases a patentee only uses specific embodiments as a tool to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the claimed invention not to limit the scope of the claims “upon reading the specification in that context it will become clear whether the patentee is setting out specific examples of the invention to accomplish those goals or whether the patentee instead intends for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be strictly coextensive” phillips  fd at  citing scimed life sys  fd at  in this case the specification states that the embodiments described therein are for “the purpose of explaining the present invention” and “not intended to limit the scope of the invention” ’ patent col  lines  to accept xacp’s constructions would clearly be erroneous and would run afoul of the federal circuit’s prohibition on importing limitations from the specification into the claims it would also run contrary to the patentee’s express intention not to limit the scope of the claims to the exemplary embodiments described in the specification  openended constructions are also prohibited many of xacp’s proffered constructions state that elements of the ’ patent claims “may” perform a particular function this type of vague openended construction has been expressly rejected by the federal circuit in cybersettle inc v national arbitration forum inc the federal circuit rejected the trial court’s claim construction whereby an accused method would infringe the claim if it was merely “capable of” a particular function in rejecting that paloalto  v k  construction the court reasoned a patented method is a series of steps each of which must be performed for infringement to occur it is not enough that a claimed step be “capable” of being performed citation omitted a party that does not perform a claimed step does not infringe a method claim merely because it is capable of doing so  fed appx   fed cir  emphasis added attached as exhibit f see also ormco corp v align tech inc  fd   fed cir  rejecting an argument that a claim requiring the replacement of appliances can be performed if the appliances are merely “capable of” being replaced in addition certain of xacp’s proposed constructions allow for such an open ended application that if adopted they would result in a claim scope that vastly exceed any reasonable interpretation of the claim for example as detailed below xacp’s proposed construction for “application object” is so vague that if it were adopted there would be no definitive definition for the term this is a problem shared by many of xacp’s constructions as detailed below iv disputed claim terms facebook’s arguments regarding the disputed claim terms are set forth below for each disputed claim term facebook has provided a chart showing a sidebyside comparison of facebook’s and xacp’s proposed construction rather than organizing the terms in alphabetical order facebook has ordered the disputed claim terms in a manner that groups terms that present similar issues for the convenience of the court facebook is also providing an appendix attached as exhibit b identifying in alphabetical order each disputed claim term and providing representative claims of the ’ patent in which each term appears  all exhibits referenced herein are attached to declaration of heidi l keefe attaching exhibits to defendant facebook’s memorandum in support of its proposed claim construction paloalto  v k  a “registered user” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction a person who has provided at least once registration information eg name address personal information etc a person who has provided at least once requested registration information eg name address personal information etc and forwarded the information to a controller the main difference between the parties’ constructions is that facebook concludes its construction of “registered user” after defining who a registered user is while xacp asks the court to import several limitations from the specification to narrow the definition of registered user xacp’s construction requires that the information be “requested” and after it is provided sent to a “controller” neither of these limitations has anything to do with the plain meaning of “registered user” and both were improperly read in from the specification xacp’s proposed construction should therefore be rejected  plain meaning of “user” and “registered” the parties agree that a “registered user” is a person who has provided at least once registration information eg name address personal information etc this construction is consistent with the plain meaning of the terms “registered” and “user” see webster’s ii new college dictionary houghton mifflin company  p  and p  ex c respectively nothing more is required to define the term  the specification does not alter the plain meaning the specification always uses the term “registered user” in a way that is consistent with the plain meaning xacp’s attempt to import further limitations is unsupportable nothing in the specification requires “registered user” to be defined to include the additional steps of registration information being “requested” from some unknown entity or “sent to a central paloalto  v k  controller” in fact the very section of the specification xacp relies upon makes it clear that these steps are mere design choices of a preferred embodiment — not definitional see ’ patent col  lines  “a registration for or other means of providing the requested information is completed by the user and may be sent by client  to central controller modules  at step ” italics added the fact that these steps are optional requires that they not be imported into the construction of “registered user” b “community” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction a virtual place or electronic medium where people having common interests can interact which can be accessed by a computer or other device information and at least one function relating to a specific transaction interaction andor expression of interest that may be accessed andor interacted with by a plurality of users with common interests through a private or public communication network such as web pages or an internet site “community” is a commonly used term with a plain and ordinary meaning which is captured by facebook’s proposed construction xacp is attempting to contort this commonly understood word into a narrow reflection of the preferred embodiment in the specification xacp’s construction begins with “information and least one function” which has nothing to do with the term “community” xacp should not be permitted to alter the plain meaning by adding litigationinspired limitations into the construction of this term  the plain meaning of “community” is applicable webster’s defines “community” as “ a a group of people residing in the same locality and under the same government b the area or locality in which such a group resides  a group or class having common interests” webster’s ii new college dictionary  houghton paloalto  v k  mifflin company ed  ex c since the ’ patent deals entirely in a computer environment see discussion below of the intrinsic record a “community” in the context of the patent is necessarily virtual otherwise the term should be given its plain and ordinary meaning  the intrinsic record supports use of the plain meaning applied to a computer environment the specification is the single best source of determining claim meaning but only to the extent it is used to determine if the plain meaning of a term should be utilized or if the term has been expressly given a special meaning it cannot be used to read limitations from preferred embodiments into the claims see part iii supra the intrinsic record is clear that the plain meaning of the word “community” governs and should only be slightly altered to be applicable to a computer environment the first mention of a “community” in the specification concerns “the william henry harrison historical preservation society” that “community” is described as a place on a computer a virtual place where people with a shared interest in william henry harrsion can interact ’ patent col  lines  the “omaha sailing club” col  line  col  line  “the xyz softball team” col  line  col  line  and other examples of communities are similarly described the specification is clear that these “communities” exist in a computer environment col  lines  and even states that these communities may contain all of the applications necessary to view and interact in the communities on the internet ’ patent col  lines   thus the specification supports the use of the plain meaning of the word “community” altered only to the extent necessary to be applicable to a computer environment xacp’s construction on the other hand improperly ignores the plain meaning of “community” by specifying that a community is undefined “information and at least one function” the specification makes it abundantly clear however that a “community” is separate paloalto  v k  and distinct from the functions and applications with which it interacts “according to an embodiment of the invention community creating module  may provide the framework through which central controller module  interacts with a user to create a community and related applications and functions” ’ patent col  lines  emphasis added if the community was meant to be defined to include one or more functions the functions would not be described separately in the specification therefore facebook’s proposed construction which does not improperly read limitations in from the specification should be adopted c “community is created” “create a community” “creating a community” and “created community” xacp has proposed separate constructions for four closely related terms that include the word “community” ie “community is created” “create a community” “creating a community” and “created community” facebook does not believe it is necessary to separately construe these four phrases once the terms “community” and “create” are construed the parties are in agreement that the word “create” means “to bring into being” webster’s ii new college dictionary houghton mifflin company  p  ex c “created” is merely the past tense “brought into being” and “creating” is the gerund form signifying present action “bringing into being” because all of these terms are simply different forms of the same word “create” it is sufficient to simply construe the root word “create” according to its plain meaning d “community field” “user field” and “vendor field” the terms “community field” “user field” and “vendor field” appear only in four dependent claims ie    and  of the ’ patent each of these claims is substantially the same claim  reads with the disputed terms shown in underlining paloalto  v k  the method according to claim  wherein community  information further comprises community fields whereby the community presents to a user at least sic at least one of wherein the presentation is based in part on a comparison of user fields community fields and vendor fields a at least one other user having user fields b at least one other community having community fields and c at least one vendor product having vendor fields the parties’ proposed constructions of these terms are set forth below claim term facebook’s construction xacp’s construction user field a location in which information about a user may be entered andor stored community field a location in which information about a community may be entered andor stored vendor field a location in which information about a vendor may be entered andor stored information that designates the interests andor demographics of a user which may comprise but is not limited to language a category or categories of interest age group location andor other items associated with a user information that designates the interests andor demographics of a community which may comprise but is not limited to a category or categories of interest language location age group andor meta tags of interest associated with a community which may overlap with another community identification information information that describes a product or service which may comprise but is not limited to a category or categories of interest language location age group andor meta tags of interest associated with a product or service the primary difference between the facebook and xacp constructions concerns precisely what the term “field” means facebook’s constructions define the three “fields” as paloalto  v k  locations where information about a user community and vendor may be entered andor stored xacp on the other hand defines the “fields” by reference to the actual information represented in those fields and improperly imports a number of limitations from the specification as shown below xacp’s proposed constructions should be rejected  facebook’s construction is the plain and ordinary meaning facebook’s constructions of “user field” “community field” and “vendor field” are consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term “field” as defined by microsoft press a “field” is a “location in a record in which a particular type of data is stored” microsoft computer dictionary  th ed  ex e this is consistent with the dictionary cited by xacp which defines field as “a portion of a record in a database containing one piece of information” xacp br at  citing barron’s dictionary of computer and internet terms   both of these definitions make clear that a “field” is where particular information is stored – and not the actual information itself  the specification supports facebook’s construction this plain and ordinary meaning is consistent with the specification of the ’ patent which likewise draws a distinction between a “field” and the information contained therein a user may select search function  to search for communities users vendors andor products as described above a creator may designate one or more community fields and a user may designate a user field according to an embodiment of the invention a vendor may designate a vendor field a vendor may have a product to sell to one or more users andor communities a vendor may describe the product by providing information for vendor fields vendor fields may comprise a category or categories of interest language location age group and metatags of interest associated with the product according to an embodiment of the invention vendor fields community fields and user fields may have corresponding information central controller module  may have a field matching function associated therein to match users communities and vendors based on the fields provided a user may provide information in a user field paloalto  v k  ’ patent col  lines  emphasis added as this passage repeatedly makes clear the “fields” are the locations where the information about users communities and vendors is stored – not the information itself xacp’s constructions should be rejected because they improperly attempt to import limitations from the specification into the claims in fact xacp’s proposed constructions attempt to pull language verbatim from portions of the specification which make clear that they are merely identifying examples of the categories of information that can be stored in the user community and vendor fields see eg ’ patent col  lines  “user fields may comprise a user’s selection of language a category or categories of interest age group location and other items to designate interests of the user” id at col  lines  “community fields may comprise a category or categories of interest language location age group and metatags of interest associated with the community and may overlap with other community identification information” id at col  lines  “vendor fields may comprise a category or categories of interest language location age group and metatags of interest associated with the product” e “creation module” “receiver module” “transmitter module” and “subscription module” the terms “creation module” “receiver module” “transmitter module” and “subscription module” present common issues and thus will be addressed together the parties’ proposed constructions are set forth below paloalto  v k  claim term facebook’s construction xacp’s construction receiver module a section of a computer program that receives data transmitter module a section of a computer program or device that transmits data creation module a section of a computer program that creates a community subscription module a section of a computer program that allows a user to subscribe to one or more subscription objects a section of a computer program that may provide the function of receiving data a section of a computer program or device that may provide the function of transmitting data a section of a computer program that may provide the function of creating a community a section of a computer program that may provide the function of subscribing to one or more subscription objects as shown in the chart above both parties generally agree on the plain meaning of these terms as they relate to the function and purpose of the “receiver module” “transmitter module” “creation module” and “subscription module” they do not agree however on whether those four modules must actually perform their designated functions xacp’s proposed constructions are illusory and should be rejected as stated above in part iiib supra xacp’s proposed constructions are also contrary to federal circuit authority xacp’s proposed constructions specify “a section of a computer program that may” perform a designated function the designated functions under xacp’s proposed constructions are entirely optional a “section of a computer program” could satisfy the definition of “receiver module” even if it receives nothing or could be a “transmitter module” even if it transmits nothing or could be a “creation module” even if it creates nothing because there is no required functionality under xacp’s proposed construction there is no functional difference between the receiver transmitter creation and subscription modules any “section of a computer program” paloalto  v k  could satisfy xacp’s illusory constructions even if it never performs its designated function  the specification supports facebook’s construction the specification makes clear that these four modules are not simply theoretical constructs with purely optional behavior they are recited in claims   and  because they perform specific unique functions relating to the claimed community creation system the receiver module receives information the transmitter module transmits it the creation module creates a community and the subscription module subscribes to subscription objects this is consistent with the specification which describes the modules as actually performing their respective specific functions according to another embodiment of the invention a computer usable medium having computer readable program code embodied therein for interaction in and creation of may be provided for example the computer usable medium may comprise a cd rom a floppy disk a hard disk or any other computer usable medium one or more of the modules of a system may comprise computer readable program code that is provided on the computer usable medium such that when the computer usable medium is installed on a computer system those modules cause the computer system to perform the functions described ’ patent col  lines  emphasis added see also ’ patent col  lines  “according to another embodiment the    communication module     and subscription objects module  may comprise computer readable code that when installed on a computer perform the functions described above” the specification confirms that the four modules actually cause the computer to perform their designated functions nowhere in the specification does it suggest that their behavior is entirely optional thus xacp’s proposed constructions should be rejected paloalto  v k  f “display module” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction a device that displays onscreen information such as a crt display a section of a computer program or device that may provide the function of displaying onscreen information there are two disagreements between facebook and xacp as to the meaning of “display module” first the parties do not agree on whether a display module is simply a “device” or can also include “a section of a computer program” second reminiscent of the terms discussed in the preceding sections the parties do not agree on whether the display module must actually perform any function as explained below the intrinsic record confirms that a “display module” is a physical device used with a computer to display onscreen information and is not a computer program  facebook’s construction is the plain and ordinary meaning the dictionary definition of “display” is “the visual output device of a computer which is commonly a crtbased video display” microsoft computer dictionary  th ed  ex e microsoft press computer dictionary   ex d the term “crt” is an acronym for “cathoderay tube” crt which simply refers to the picture tube used with televisions computer monitors and other video display devices  facebook’s construction is consistent with the specification facebook’s construction is also consistent with the specification which expressly defines  microsoft computer dictionary  th ed  ex e defining “crt” as “acronym for cathoderay tube the basis of the television screen and the standard microcomputer display screen a crt display is built around a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns whose electron beams rapidly sweep horizontally across the inside front surface of the tube which is coated with a material that glows when irradiated” bold in original paloalto  v k  the term “display module” as having its plain and ordinary meaning according to an embodiment of the invention each computer  may be configured as a typical home based computer other configurations may also be used each computer  may contain a communication application module  a processor module  and a memory module    computer  may have at least one input device  for controlling the computer  input device  may be a keyboard joystick touchpad scanner or any similar device or combination of devices each of computers  may also include a display module  such as a crt display or other device ’ patent col  line col  line  bold in original underlining added the passage above from the specification makes clear that the “display module” is a crt display “or other device” which does not suggest that the display module can be a computer program as xacp suggests xacp argues that a “display module” must be construed as including a section of a computer program because the specification refers to other types of “modules” that may be implemented as computer code not only is there nothing in the specification to suggest that a “display module” can be a portion of a computer program the specification indicates that just the opposite is true the specification makes clear that some “modules” may be provided as computer code but others such as the display module may not according to one embodiment central controller module  user interface module  link application module  processor module  memory module  communication application module  user interface module  community creating module  invitation module  communication module  application platform  session controller module  governor server module  application controller modules  and subscription objects module  may comprise computer readable code that when installed on a computer perform the functions described above also only some of the modules may be provided in computer readable code ’ patent col  line  bold in original underlining added the abovequoted passage provides a comprehensive listing of the various “modules” that may be provided as computer code but notably does not include “display module” as one of paloalto  v k  them the passage also states that “only some of the modules may be provided as computer readable code” which obviously means that other modules cannot the “display module” is clearly one of the modules that may not be provided as computer code as it is referred to in the specification solely as a physical display device see safetcare mfg inc v telemade inc  fd   fed cir  “in explaining the importance of referring to the specification in determining and understanding the meaning and scope of a patent claim we have stated that ‘the specification ‘is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis’” quoting phillips  fd at  finally facebook’s construction is the only construction that is consistent with the manner in which “display module” is used in the claim the term “display module” appears only in claim  as follows “a display module for displaying prompts for the community identification information the at least one communications address and the selection of the at least one application object” ’ patent col  lines  a computer program is not physically capable of “displaying prompts” or anything else to a user it is simply a collection of instructions to carry out operations on data to actually “display prompts” or anything else for that matter a physical device is required for generating visual signals for the user to perceive g “creation transmission” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction an electronic signal indicating a request to create a community an electronic transmission through a private or public communication network indicating a request to create a community the prime dispute between the parties turns on xacp’s use of the word “transmission” in its proposed construction it is improper to use the term “transmission” itself in a construction paloalto  v k  that is supposed to define that very term – “creation transmission” to do so is completely unhelpful to the fact finder  the plain meaning of “transmission” transmission is the noun form of “transmit” webster’s defines “transmit” in the electronic or computer context as “to send a signal as by wire or radio” webster’s ii new college dictionary houghton mifflin company  p  ex c the same dictionary defines a “transmission” as “something as a voice or message that is transmitted” id the plain and ordinary meaning of the term “transmission” therefore refers to the thing that has been transmitted or sent xacp argues that the plain meaning proposed by facebook somehow impermissibly narrows a transmission to a “signal” but that is exactly what a transmission is a signal that has been sent facebook is simply embracing the plain meaning of the term xacp’s attempt to define “creation transmission” as “an electronic transmission” is a circular nondefinition that will not assist the trier of fact in understanding the claim term  the intrinsic record supports adoption of the plain meaning the term “creation transmission” is not used anywhere in the specification there are a number of mentions of “transmissions” but they are all limited to the transmission of invitations principally in the form of emails see col  lines  col  lines  col  lines   each of those references supports the plain meaning of a “transmission” as an electronic signal the phrase “creation transmission” is used in each of the independent claims yet it is completely unsupported in the specification rendering all such claims invalid for failing to meet the written description requirement of  usc §  ¶  for purposes of claim construction because the term “creation transmission” is not used in the specification the specification may paloalto  v k  not be used to alter the plain meaning of the term h “transmitting” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction electronically sending electronically connecting sending out andor communicating by any wireless or wire mechanism the word “transmitting” is a common and everyday term that should be given its plain and ordinary meaning only facebook’s proposed construction captures it webster’s defines “transmit” in the electronic and computer context as “to send a signal as by wire or radio” webster’s ii new college dictionary houghton mifflin company  p  ex c it is obvious that “transmitting” simply means sending xacp’s construction on the other hand is a transparent attempt to redefine the everyday word “transmitting” to attempt to capture facebook’s website by including activities that have nothing to do with transmitting for example xacp’s construction of “transmitting” would be satisfied by merely “electronically connecting” to something even if the act of connecting never resulted in anything being transmitted or sent common sense tells us that one does not “transmit” something by merely “connecting” to something else two things can be “connected” to one another even if nothing is being actually transmitted between them while the act of “transmitting” may inherently require the establishment of a connection transmitting entails the further act of actually sending something from one place to another xacp devotes a substantial portion of its brief to quoting portions of the specification but those passages have nothing to do with the construction of the term “transmitting” nothing in the specification suggests that the plain meaning of “transmitting” should be altered paloalto  v k  i “communications address” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction information that specifies the precise location in a computer system or network where a communication may be received or sent such as an email address ip address url or internet relay chat address the precise location in a computer system or network where a communication may be received or sent such as an email address ip address url or internet replay sic chat address the key difference between the competing constructions is that xacp is attempting to improperly construe “address” as a location rather than information that directs you to a location  the plain meaning of “address” the microsoft press dictionary defines “address” in the computer context as “a name or token specifying a particular computer or site on the internet or other network” microsoft press computer dictionary  th ed  ex e the name or token could be for example an email or ip address that directs you to a location but is not the location itself an address can also include an alias that is converted by the computer into a full address a simple example would be a street address a street address is information a name or token that specifies a physical location eg a home on a street it is not the location itself but merely information that identifies the location the same is true for the “virtual” locations in a computer environment an email address is a name or token information that specifies a location where email can be sent – it is not the actual location itself as xacp contends  the specification supports the plain meaning of “communications address” the specification makes it clear that a “communications address” is the information that a user provides to be used to invite others to join a community whenever “communications address” is used it is always followed by the exemplary explanatory language “such as” paloalto  v k  indicating that there are many possible names or tokens that can provide the appropriate contact information ’ patent col  lines  col  lines  col  lines  col  lines  none of the references in the specification indicate that the plain meaning of “communications address” should be altered to mean a location rather than information leading to a location facebook’s construction which adopts the plain meaning should be used j “application object” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction a computer program or module that directs a user to specific information andor enables a user to do something useful including but not limited to java chat scheduling invitations pledging photo albums shopping carts instant messaging navigating searching addresses news groups announcements white boards calendars video conferencing video chat voice chat e mail lists andor bulletin boards a computer program or module that may function to direct a user to specific information andor enables a user to do something useful and may be for among other things java chat scheduling pledging viewing a photo album a shopping cart instant messaging navigation searching addresses a news group announcements a white board a calendar video conferencing video chat andor a bulletin board the main difference between the parties’ proposed constructions of “application object” is that xacp’s construction does not require that the “application object” actually do anything it simply identifies a possible function an application object “may” but is not required to do xacp’s proposed construction is illusory and should be rejected for the same reason as the “creation module” “receiver module” “transmission module” and “subscription module” definitions previously addressed there is nothing in the specification or plain meaning of the term “application object” that indicates such purely optional behavior xacp’s proposed definition is undermined by the very dictionary definition of “application” cited in its claim construction brief “a program that enables a user to do something useful with the computer such as writing or accounting as opposed to utilities programs that help the user maintain the paloalto  v k  computer” xacp br at  citing webster’s new world computer dictionary  th ed  emphasis added under xacp’s proposed construction the “application object” would become any “computer program or module” without requiring that it perform the actual function of an application object such an illusory construction will aid no one and should be rejected k “subscription object” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction an item to which a user subscribes which may comprise but is not limited to chat content a publication a product to purchase a photograph file web page andor other item an object that is published and to which a user may subscribe which may comprise but is not limited to chat content a publication a product to purchase a photograph file web page andor other item as shown above there are only minor differences between the parties’ constructions of “subscription object” first facebook defines a “subscription object” as an “item” whereas xacp defines it as an “object” facebook used the term “item” to avoid having to use the word “object” to define the term “subscription object” but this does not alter the meaning second xacp’s proposed construction attempts to import the limitation of an object “that is published” as with many other terms xacp’s construction improperly imports limitations from the written description into the claims the specification discusses publication of subscription objects merely as a preferred embodiment see ’ patent col  lines  “subscription objects may be various objects such as chat content a product to purchase a photograph file or other item which has been published by another user” emphasis added there is no basis for importing the requirement “that is published” into the definition of a subscription object xacp’s construction is also unsupportable in light of the claims claims  and  for example state paloalto  v k  the method according to claim  further comprising the  step of receiving a selection to subscribe to at least one subscription object wherein the at least one subscription object is accessed through one of the at least one application object the method according to claim  wherein the at least one  subscription object is published by at least one of a at least one other community b at least one other user and c at least one vendor the difference between claim  and  illustrates that the applicants knew how to specify when they wanted to require a subscription object to be “published” and when they did not under xacp’s proposed construction the “subscription object” of claim  would need to be “published” even though the applicants provided an entirely separate claim to call out that detail moreover a construction of “subscription object” that requires it to be published would not make sense as applied to claim  because the subscription object would need to be published again pursuant to that claim the absence of a reference to publication in claim  and its presence in claim  is further reason to reject xacp’s proposed construction l “subscribe” and “subscribing” claim term facebook’s construction xacp’s construction subscribe to designate something to be interacted with andor accessed in one or more communities subscribing designating something to be interacted with andor accessed in one or more communities select to be interacted with andor accessed in one or more communities which may comprise but is not limited to selecting to automatically receive updated information applications functions andor other aspects of one or more communities selecting to be interacted with andor accessed in one or more communities which may comprise but is not limited to selecting to automatically receive updated information applications functions andor other aspects of one or more communities paloalto  v k  there is little substantive difference between the parties’ proposed constructions of “subscribe” and “subscribing” the primary difference is that xacp’s constructions end with the text “selecting to automatically receive updated information applications functions andor other aspects of one or more communities” the passage of the specification on which xacp relies states that the subscription system allows a user to receive “updated content objects” ’ patent col  lines  but makes no mention of receiving updated “applications functions andor other aspects of one or more communities” there is no reason to import this additional language into the claim m “published” facebook’s proposed construction xacp’s proposed construction made available to others made available for others to interact with andor access in one or more communities the parties agree that the plain and ordinary meaning of “published” includes “made available to others” but xacp is impermissibly attempting to import details from the specification into the meaning of this straightforward term xacp manufactured its proposed construction by combining two different examples from the specification one using the word “interact” and another using the term “access” and improperly importing those into its proposed construction see ’ patent col  lines  col  lines  facebook’s proposed construction should therefore be adopted v agreed constructions the parties are in agreement on the following terms paloalto  v k  claim term agreed construction selecting selection community identification information the act of choosing one or more things one or more things that have been chosen information that identifies the community being
