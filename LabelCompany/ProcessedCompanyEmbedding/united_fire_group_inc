stable all companies are headquartered in cedar rapids ia see below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings the ratings of united fire  casualty group reflect its solid riskadjusted capitalization diversified commercial product offerings historically favorable core reserve levels and the financial flexibility afforded by ufg united fire casualty group’s ratings also reflect the continued advantages of its longstanding agency relationships and solid regional franchise which was enhanced by the acquisition of mercer insurance group inc mercer and its propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries in march  in addition underwriting results improved substantially in  as a result of rate revisions less catastrophic and large loss activity and continued favorable prior year loss reserve development these positive rating factors are partially offset by the variability in united fire  casualty group’s underwriting and operating results in recent years driven by adverse loss reserve development from hurricane katrinarelated claims in  and  catastrophe and weatherrelated losses in  and the continued challenging albeit improving market conditions in the group’s core markets the icr of ufg recognizes the capital strength of its subsidiaries and the fact that it has no outstanding debt while am best believes ufg and united fire casualty group’s ratings are well positioned at their current rating levels factors that may lead to negative rating actions include a trend of deteriorating underwriting and operating performance to a level below its peers andor an erosion of surplus that causes a decline in riskadjusted capital to a level that no longer supports the current ratings if you liked this article you might like  stocks spiking on big volume these stocks rising
