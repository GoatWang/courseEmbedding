strategy employs a quantitative price momentum based rotation model for sectors and indexes developed by marty mcclelland the objective is to achieve attractive rates of return while controlling risk this model was originally developed based on seven years of market data from  through  and it has been continuously refined and managed since  investment philosophy during any period of time there are groups of similar securities sectors that outperform the market averages these periods of outperformance can last for as long as one year or more often even in flat or down markets selected sectors perform well for example if high oil prices threaten economic growth at least one of the energy related sectors should perform well if commodity inflation pressures the market the precious metal sector should outperform the investment strategy is designed to capitalize on this behavior the years  and  provide examples the market was up approximately  in both  and  and the strategy significantly outperformed in each year  based on a heavy focus on energyrelated sectors and gold when do we buy we monitor over  index sector and exchange traded funds daily and identify those funds exhibiting the most momentum over short intermediate and longterm periods we invest in the topperforming funds and hold each as long as it remains in the set of top performers when do we sell our sell decision is based entirely on longterm momentum to avoid unnecessary volatility caused by temporary shortterm moves when a fund falls out of the set of top performing funds we sell it and replace it with a fund from the set of then top performers in cases where no funds are demonstrating positive momentum the strategy invests in a money market fund to protect against excessive losses when we are fully invested we employ stop loss triggers for risk control what to expect the momentum strategy typically outperforms in sustained upwardtrending markets characterized by consistent market leadership where the strategy typically underperforms is during market transitions such as early  bearish to bullish and  bearish to bullish the strategy would likely underperform the market in an environment where no sectors demonstrate a sustained upward move and individual sectors repeatedly rally only to quickly decline to price levels below where the rally began  brownsboro road suite

tax – managed strategy momentum strategy contact us regent quarterly market letter important disclosure information market letter nd quarter  the market’s strength continued during the second quarter interest rates remain at low levels and fell further during the quarter this brings us back to tina there is no alternative and tina drives money into the stock market the economy slowed a bit during the first quarter to about a  annual growth rate but it accelerated in the second quarter to about  commodity prices were weak during q which caused the stock market to worry less about interest rate increases   q   ytd sp     dow jones     nasdaq   foreign markets generally outperformed the us during the second quarter europe was the best performer vgk gained  during q and brazil was the worst ewz fell  q  review technology stocks were strong during the second quarter with the nasdaq once again outperforming the sp and the dow jones industrial average people talk about faang facebook apple amazon netflix and google and these and similar stocks have paced the market all year for the year facebook is up  apple is up  amazon is up  netflix is up  and google is up  healthcare stocks were very strong during the second quarter some of the fears about a healthcare bill faded the bill is not tough on drug pricing it removes taxes on medical devices and it is friendly to health insurance companies for the second quarter amgen increased  medtronic gained  and united healthcare increased  these are big leaders in their subsectors but they are mostly representative of healthcare sector performance energy stocks were the worst performers in the market with the xle index falling  iran iraq and libya are all producing more oil and us production is booming in our letter from the last quarter we wrote about our inflation concerns and we highlighted commodity prices commodity prices had been strong but they were broadly weaker in q oil is the biggest component of commodity prices and it fell again during q  from  to  natural gas prices also fell during q copper gold and soy bean prices were relatively unchanged corn and wheat were up during q wages are still up almost  over the same time last year but the fall in commodities caused the increase in the consumer price index cpi to slow down the most recent cpi was up  which is still below the federal reserve’s target inflation rate of  the unemployment rate ticked down  during the quarter to  the federal reserve increased interest rates by  in june but given the reduction in inflation the federal reserve may hold off in raising interest rates for the rest of this year despite the rise in short–term interest rates longer term rates declined with the yield on the –year treasury bond falling from  to  financial stocks xlf were weak early in the quarter but rallied strongly at the end of the quarter for a total increase of  the us dollar was weak during the second quarter combined with better q growth this caused estimates for corporate profits earnings to increase the price–to–earnings ratio pe for the market remains high at about  this is higher than the long–term average if rates stay low and growth stays positive tina should remain in place and an  pe is sustainable however the higher the pe gets the higher the risk becomes if rates increase or if growth falters q  investment strategy the  election changed our view slightly had mrs clinton been elected we expected a recession in  or  the trump administration is reducing regulations and generally helping businesses there are promises of foreign profits repatriation lower tax rates and increased infrastructure spending the market is still giving the administration the benefit of doubt on these issues if enacted these policies won’t stop the business cycle but they are likely to extend it and we are now planning for a later downturn in  or  we became modestly more bullish after the election in q we maintained this modestly bullish posture and we plan the same for q we must remember that we are now over  years into this economic expansion that began in march  the longest expansion in the history of the us has been  years although we became more bullish after the election we remain aware that a downturn is still likely to be on the near–term horizon if the market continues to perform well and pe ratios expand further or if the federal reserve raises interest rates too much we will move to a more defensive posture the federal reserve is now forecasting one additional rate increase in  – taking the federal funds rate from the current  to  since inflation has moderated recently we think they may hold off on this rate increase the  forecast is for  rate increases – for a total increase of  growth will need to pick up for this to happen in addition to raising shortterm interest rates the federal reserve also plans to shrink its balance sheet ie own less bonds and mortgages in the last few years the fed has been increasing its balance sheet quantitative easing to keep interest rates artificially low starting later this year they plan to stop buying bonds and mortgages and to potentially begin selling them the fed moving from a buyer to a seller should have the effect of increasing interest rates with growth continuing and with the fed removing accommodation we expect interest rates to rise later this year and next year the interest rate on the –year treasury bond is currently about  we expect that it will rise to  –  this year and perhaps as high as  –  in  if this happens we doubt the economy can handle rates this high and this could be the trigger for a  or  recession it’s also possible that the next downturn could be triggered by a geopolitical event north korea is probably the most concerning between kim jong–un and donald trump you would be hard pressed to find more potentially volatile adversaries a confrontation with north korea would definitely affect south korea japan

your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
