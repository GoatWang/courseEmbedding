announcing an estimated per share net asset value “nav” of the company’s common stock of  the press release is attached hereto as exhibit  and incorporated herein by reference determination of estimated per share nav      overview based on the recommendation from a valuation committee comprised solely of the company’s independent directors including the independent chairman of the board the “valuation committee” on march   the company’s board of directors the “board” unanimously approved and established an estimated per share nav of the company’s common stock of  based on an estimated market value of the company’s assets less the estimated market value of the company’s liabilities divided by the total number of shares outstanding as of december   the company is providing this estimated per share nav to assist brokerdealers that participated in the company’s public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under national association of securities dealers conduct rule  the estimated per share nav will first appear on stockholder account statements for the quarter ended march   the board previously determined an estimated per share nav of the company’s common stock of  as of september   and an estimated per share nav of  as of august   the company intends to publish an updated estimated per share nav on at least an annual basis process in determining the estimated per share nav the board considered information and analysis including valuation materials that were provided by duff  phelps llc “duff  phelps” information provided by the company’s advisor cole reit advisors iv llc “cr iv advisors” and the estimated per share nav recommendation made by the valuation committee duff  phelps is an independent global valuation advisory and corporate finance consulting firm that specializes in providing real estate valuation services that was engaged by the company to perform a full valuation of the properties that were acquired prior to june   and to assess the reasonableness of the valuation of the seven properties that were acquired by the company since june   as further described below duff  phelps also reviewed the company’s methodology for estimating fair market adjustments to the company’s debt and determined that the approach was reasonable the engagement of duff  phelps was approved by the valuation committee duff  phelps’ scope of work was conducted in conformity with the requirements of the code of professional ethics and standards of professional practice of the appraisal institute several members of the duff  phelps engagement team who certified the methodologies and assumptions applied by the company hold a member of appraisal institute “mai” designation duff  phelps was previously engaged by the company in july  and july  to assist the board in determining the estimated per share nav of the company in january  duff  phelps was engaged by cole credit property trust v inc “ccpt v” another real estate program sponsored by cole capital to assist its board of directors in determining the estimated per share nav of ccpt v and was later engaged by ccpt v in december  to assist its board of directors in determining an updated estimated per share nav other than the engagements with ccpt v and the prior engagements with the company as described herein duff  phelps does not have any direct interests in any transaction with the company or the company’s advisor or its affiliates and has not performed any other services for the company or the company’s advisor or its affiliates during the past two years the analysis provided by duff  phelps included a range of navs of the company’s shares and the board believes that the use of the “nav methodology” as discussed below as the primary or sole indicator of value has become widely accepted as a best practice in the valuation of nonlisted reit shares and therefore the board determined to use the nav methodology in establishing the estimated per share nav based on these considerations the valuation committee recommended and the board established an estimated per share nav of the company’s common stock as of december   of  per share which was the approximate midpoint of the  to  per share valuation range calculated by duff  phelps using the nav methodology the valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of the investment program association practice guideline  valuations of publicly registered nonlisted reits the board is ultimately and solely responsible for the establishment of the estimated per share nav    valuation methodology in preparing its valuation materials and in reaching its conclusions as to the reasonableness of the methodologies and assumptions used by the company to value its assets duff  phelps among other things • reviewed financial and operating information requested from or provided by the company including property level cash flow projections for each of the properties and market leasing assumptions for each of the multitenant properties • researched the market by means of publications and other resources to measure current market conditions supply and demand factors and growth patterns and their effect on each of the subject properties • reviewed all other assets and liabilities of the company including mortgage debt to determine the reasonableness of fair value of such items as of the valuation date and • reviewed company provided valuation including narratives computations and supporting documentation • discussed the valuations and related writeups with the relevant members of the company’s deal teams or valuation group to understand the company’s expectations and intent with respect to each of the properties • performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other factors as duff  phelps considered appropriate for  singletenant properties and  multitenant properties that were acquired by the company prior to june   for which duff  phelps performed a full valuation duff  phelps utilized two approaches pursuant to the nav methodology in valuing the company’s real estate assets that are commonly used in the commercial real estate industry the following is a summary of the nav methodology and the valuation approaches used by duff  phelps for two singletenant properties and five multitenant properties acquired by the company since june   duff  phelps used the acquisition price as the value after performance of a positive assurance analysis nav methodology  – the nav methodology determines the value of the company by determining the estimated market value of the company’s entity level assets including real estate assets and subtracting the market value of its entity level liabilities including its debt the materials provided by duff  phelps to estimate the value of the real estate assets were prepared using discrete estimations of “as is” market valuations for each of the properties in the company’s portfolio using the income capitalization approach as the primary indicator of value and the sales comparison approach as a secondary approach to value as discussed in greater detail below from the aggregate values of the individual properties duff  phelps made adjustments to reflect balance sheet assets and liabilities the resulting amount which is the estimated nav of the company is divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding to determine the estimated per share nav duff  phelps also reviewed the company’s methodology for estimating fair market adjustments to the debt and determined that the approach was reasonable determination of estimated market value of the company’s real estate assets under the nav methodology income capitalization approach – the income capitalization approach simulates the reasoning of an investor who views the cash flows that would result from the anticipated revenue and expense on a property throughout its lifetime the net operating income “noi” developed in duff  phelps’ analysis is the balance of potential income remaining after vacancy collection loss and operating expenses this noi was then capitalized at an appropriate rate to derive an estimate of value the “direct capitalization method” or discounted by an appropriate yield rate over a typical projection period in a discounted cash flow analysis the “dcf method” thus two key steps were involved  estimating the noi applicable to the subject property and  choosing appropriate capitalization rates and discount rates duff  phelps utilized the direct capitalization method for the properties in the company’s portfolio with more than eight years remaining on their existing leases or whose options will likely be exercised so that the remaining term is greater than eight years and the dcf method for the remaining properties the following summarizes the range of overall capitalization rates duff  phelps used to arrive at the estimated market values of the company’s properties valued using the direct capitalization method     range   weightedaverage overall capitalization rate    to      the following summarizes the range of terminal capitalization rates discount rates and implied overall capitalization rates duff  phelps used to arrive at the estimated market values of the company’s properties valued using the dcf method     range   weightedaverage terminal capitalization rate    to     discount rate    to     implied overall capitalization rate     to       excludes four properties due to vacancy as of december   the board believes that the assumptions employed by duff  phelps in the income capitalization approach are reasonable and within the ranges used for properties that are similar to the company’s properties and held by investors with similar expectations to the company’s investors however a change in the assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of the company’s investments in real estate for example assuming all other factors remain unchanged an increase of  basis points in the capitalization rates determined for the company’s properties valued using the direct capitalization method together with an increase of  basis points in the discount rates used for properties valued using the dcf method would result in a decrease of  per share from the approximate midpoint of duff  phelps’ valuation range while a  basis point decrease in these rates would result in an increase of  per share from the approximate midpoint of the valuation range further each of these assumptions could change by more than  basis points or not change at all sales comparison approach  – the sales comparison approach estimates value based on what other purchasers and sellers in the market have agreed to as the price for comparable improved properties this approach is based upon the principle of substitution which states that the limits of prices rents and rates tend to be set by the prevailing prices rents and rates of equally desirable substitutes utilizing the nav methodology including use of the two approaches to value the company’s real estate assets noted above and dividing by the approximately  million shares of the company’s common stock outstanding on december   resulted in an estimated valuation range of  to  per share  with a base value or approximate midpoint of  duff  phelps prepared and provided to the company a report containing among other information a range of net asset values for the company’s common stock as of december   the “valuation report” on march   the valuation committee conferred with duff  phelps regarding the methodologies and assumptions used in the valuation report and discussed the valuation report and related issues with the company’s advisor the valuation committee met again to discuss the valuation on march   in determining a recommended per share nav the valuation committee considered the analysis provided by duff  phelps and the range of values duff  phelps determined input from the company’s advisor regarding the nature and characteristics of the real estate assets in the portfolio and general real estate market conditions based upon this information the valuation committee determined to recommend to the board an estimated per share nav of  which was the approximate midpoint of the range determined by duff  phelps the board thereafter unanimously approved the valuation committee’s recommendation the table below sets forth the calculation of the company’s estimated per share nav as of december   dollars in thousands except per share values     estimated nav   estimated per share nav investment in real estate assets         other assets       total assets                 notes payable and credit facility       other liabilities       total liabilities       total estimated value as of december           shares outstanding in thousands         exclusions from estimated per share nav the estimated per share nav recommended by the valuation committee and approved by the board does not reflect any “portfolio premium” nor does it reflect an enterprise value of the company which may include a premium or discount to nav for • the size of the company’s portfolio as some buyers may pay more for a portfolio compared to prices for individual investments • the overall geographic and tenant diversity of the portfolio as a whole • the characteristics of the company’s working capital leverage credit facilities and other financial structures where some buyers may ascribe different values based on synergies cost savings or other attributes • certain thirdparty transaction or other expenses that would be necessary to realize the value • services being provided by personnel of cr iv advisors under the advisory agreement and the company’s potential ability to secure the services of a management team on a longterm basis or • the potential difference in per share nav if the company were to list its shares of common stock on a national securities exchange limitations of the estimated per share nav as with any valuation methodology the nav methodology used by the board in reaching an estimate of the per share nav of the company’s shares is based upon a number of estimates assumptions judgments and opinions that may or may not prove to be correct the use of different valuation methods estimates assumptions judgments or opinions may have resulted in significantly different estimates of the per share nav of the company’s shares in addition the board’s estimate of the per share nav is not based on the book values of the company’s real estate as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as the company’s book value for most real estate is based on the amortized cost of the property subject to certain adjustments furthermore in reaching an estimate of the per share nav of the company’s shares the board did not include a discount for debt that may include a prepayment obligation or a provision precluding assumption of the debt by a third party in addition although selling costs were used by duff  phelps in the individual valuation of multitenant properties using the dcf method other costs that are likely to be incurred in connection with an appropriate exit strategy whether that strategy involves a listing of the company’s shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a merger of the company or a sale of the company’s portfolio were not included in the board’s estimate of the per share nav of the company’s shares as a result there can be no assurance that • stockholders will be able to realize the estimated per share nav upon attempting to sell their shares or • the company will be able to achieve for its stockholders the estimated per share nav upon a listing of the company’s shares of common stock on a national securities exchange a merger of the company or a sale of the company’s portfolio furthermore the estimated per share nav of the company’s shares was calculated as of a particular point in time the per share nav of the company’s shares will fluctuate over time as a result of among other things developments related to individual assets and changes in the real estate and capital markets additional information regarding engagement of duff  phelps duff  phelps’ valuation materials were addressed solely to the company in connection with the approval by the board of an estimated per share nav of the common stock of the company as of december   duff  phelps’ valuation materials provided to the company do not constitute a recommendation to purchase or sell any shares of the company’s common stock or other securities the estimated per share nav of the company’s common stock may vary depending on numerous factors that generally impact the price of securities the financial condition of the company and the state of the real estate industry more generally such as changes in economic or market conditions changes in interest rates changes in the supply of and demand for commercial real estate properties and changes in tenants’ financial condition in connection with its review while duff  phelps reviewed the information supplied or otherwise made available to it by the company for reasonableness duff  phelps assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information and of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it by any other party and did not undertake any duty  or responsibility to verify independently any of such information with respect to financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with duff  phelps duff  phelps assumed that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the company and relied upon the company to advise duff  phelps promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of its review in preparing its valuation materials duff  phelps did not and was not requested to solicit thirdparty indications of interest for the company in connection with possible purchases of the company’s securities or the acquisition of all or any part of the company in performing its analyses duff  phelps made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance general business economic and regulatory conditions and other matters many of which are beyond duff  phelps’ control and the control of the company the analyses performed by duff  phelps are not necessarily indicative of actual values trading values or actual future results of the company’s common stock that might be achieved all of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses the analyses do not reflect the prices at which properties may actually be sold and such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty as stated above the board considered other factors in establishing the estimated per share nav of the company’s common stock in addition to the materials prepared by duff  phelps consequently the analyses contained in the duff  phelps materials should not be viewed as being determinative of the board’s estimate of the per share nav of the company’s common stock duff  phelps’ materials were necessarily based upon market economic financial and other circumstances and conditions existing at december   and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may have affected duff  phelps’ analysis but duff  phelps does not have and has disclaimed any obligation to update revise or reaffirm its materials as of any date subsequent to december   for services rendered in connection with and upon the delivery of its valuation materials the company paid duff  phelps a customary fee

the amount of the estimated value the attainment of a stipulated result or the occurrence of a subsequent event directly related to the intended use of the valuation materials the company also agreed to reimburse duff  phelps for its expenses incurred in connection with its services and will indemnify duff  phelps against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement distribution reinvestment
