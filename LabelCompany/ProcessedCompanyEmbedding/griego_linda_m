on mar   entitled “methods and apparatus for the infusion of foodstuffs with agent substances” which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entiretyfield of the inventionthis patent specification relates to the field of foodstuff preparation more specifically this patent specification relates to systems and methods that facilitate the integration of one or more agent substances—such as for flavor nutrition medication or the like—into the structures of dry foodstuffsbackgroundflavor combination is a well known practice that involves combining two or more foodstuff items to create a new foodstuff that incorporates the flavors of the combined foodstuff items for example chocolate covered dried cranberries have a unique flavor that is created by coating a dried cranberry in liquid chocolate and then drying the chocolate while widely practiced in foodstuff preparation conventional combining practices may come with a number of drawbacks for example conventional combining practices may rely on liquid processes or coating ingredients to accomplish combining perhaps adding time expense and potentially unnecessary ingredients to a combining system conventional combining practices also may have failed to produce certain foodstuff and flavor combinations available via a combining system that does not rely on liquid coatings and other coating agents unfortunately these coatings may be easily dislodged from the surface of a coated foodstuff through washing normal handling transportation settling and the likethe foregoing problems related to conventional foodstuff preparation may represent a longfelt need for an effective solution to the same while implementing elements may have been available actual attempts to meet this need may have been lacking to some degree this may have been due to a failure of those having ordinary skill in the art to fully appreciate or understand the nature of the problems and challenges involved as a result of this lack of understanding attempts to meet these longfelt needs may have failed to effectively solve one or more of the problems or challenges here identified these attempts may even have led away from the technical directions taken by the present inventive technology and may even result in the achievements of the present inventive technology being considered to some degree an unexpected result of the approach taken by some in the fieldtherefore a need exists for novel systems and methods that facilitate the integration of one or more agent substances such as for flavor nutrition medication or the like into the structures of dry foodstuffs there is a further need for novel foodstuff and agent substance integration systems and methods that do not rely on liquid coatings and other coating agents finally there exists a need for novel foodstuff and agent substance integration systems and methods that are able to integrate foodstuff and agent substances together into a product in which the agent substances are not dislodged from the surface of an integrated foodstuff product through washing normal handling transportation settling and the likebrief summary of the inventiona foodstuff and agent

agitation device  may include a substantially dry foodstuff input  which of course may be configured to input a substantially dry foodstuff  of the kinds or having any of the other properties or characteristics as described hereinwith respect to the steps of providing a substantially dry agent substance  and a substantially dry foodstuff  of course it should be understood that multiple agent substances and multiple foodstuffs may be utilized either separately or in any combinations or amounts consistent with the inventive principles described herein as but one example embodiments may involve providing at least one additional substantially dry agent substance  at least one additional substantially dry foodstuff  or both at least one additional substantially dry agent substance  and at least one additional substantially dry foodstuff  an agitation device  accordingly may have in various embodiments at least one additional substantially dry agent substance input  andor at least one additional dry permeable foodstuff input as perhaps best shown in figs  in some embodiments the method  may comprise agitating a combination of a foodstuff  and an agent substance  within an agitation device  an agitation device  may comprise an agitation chamber  and an optional lid  which may form a cavity  the cavity  may bound and form a substantially liquidfree agitation area  andor a substantially liquidfree permeation zone  by depositing or adding one or more foodstuffs  into contact with one or more agent substances  a combination consisting essentially of one or more foodstuffs and one or more agent substances  may be formed in some embodiments by depositing or adding a foodstuff  and an agent substance  into contact with each other within the cavity  of an agitation device  a combination consisting essentially of one or more foodstuffs and one or more agent substances  may be formed in step in some embodiments an agitation device  may comprise a food tumbler type of agitation device  which may be configured with a cavity  comprising one or more paddles  a paddle  may comprise a projection of any size or shape which may optionally be coupled to the agitation chamber  andor optionally movably positioned within the cavity  in preferred embodiments an agitation device  may comprise a motor  which may be coupled to the agitation chamber  such as with a belt  and pulleys  gears chain drive drive shaft or any other suitable method of motion transfer including direct coupling of a motor  to the agitation chamber  in further embodiments an agitation device  may comprise a control unit  which may function as a timer and control the agitation rate and time periodin further embodiments an agitation device  may be configured to perform rotational agitation so that a combination consisting essentially of one or more foodstuffs and one or more agent substances  within the cavity  may be rotated or tumbled by the rotation of the agitation chamber  in other embodiments an agitation device  may be configured to perform vibrational agitation so that a combination consisting essentially of one or more foodstuffs and one or more agent substances  within the cavity  may be vibrated by the vibration of the agitation chamber  in still other embodiments an agitation device  may be configured to perform stirring blending incorporating or any other type of agitation to combination consisting essentially of one or more foodstuffs and one or more agent substances  within the cavity the method  may involve agitating a substantially dry agent substance  and a substantially dry foodstuff  in the substantial absence of a liquid that is not intrinsic to the substantially dry agent substance  and a substantially dry foodstuff  in such agitation a liquid may not be the medium of permeation of a substantially dry foodstuff  with a substantially dry agent substance  or otherwise may not play an outcome determinative role in such permeation infusion or the like for example agitation may occur in the substantial absence of liquids typically involved in foodstuff preparation such as water syrups fruit juices or the like or perhaps simply may be restricted to the residual moisture if any of a dried fruit provided as the substantially dry foodstuff  of course embodiments may include the complete absence of moisture liquids or the like which are not intrinsic to the agent substance  or foodstuff  during such agitation or perhaps may be limited to such as may be contributed by a substantially dry agent substance  or a substantially dry foodstuff an agitation device  accordingly may have in various embodiments a substantially liquidfree agitation area  configured to receive a substantially dry agent substance  from a substantially dry agent substance input  and a substantially dry foodstuff  from a substantially dry permeable foodstuff input  naturally the substantially liquidfree agitation area  may have any of the properties or characteristics described hereinthe method  may involve permeating a substantially dry foodstuff  with a substantially dry agent substance  as a result of agitating them for example the relative motions of the foodstuff and the agent substance during agitation may create multiple opportunities for contact wherein the agent substance  through such contact may permeate the foodstuff  as may be encouraged by the motions of the agitation as mentioned above the foodstuff  may have spaces pores interstices or the like capable of receiving and holding the agent substance  through such permeation or integration where the agent substance  is in a solids form such as powder or granules permeation may be effected by allowing individual grains to permeate through such spaces pores interstices or the like in this manner the agent substance  and the foodstuff  may be integrated together to form an agent permeated foodstuff  in which the agent substance  and the foodstuff  may not be separated by physical or mechanical methods this integration is distinct from a foodstuff that is coated with a cereal or flavoring agent since the coating of the cereal or flavoring agent may be broken off washed off or otherwise removed from the foodstuffan apparatus accordingly may have a substantially liquidfree permeation zone  of a substantially liquidfree agitation area  responsive to a substantially dry agent substance input  and a substantially dry permeable foodstuff input  moreover various embodiments may involve permeating in the absence of applied heat perhaps such as approximately room temperature permeating also may be done in the absence of an applied vacuum or perhaps by applying only a lowpressure vacuum during the step of permeating such as up to  inches of mercurynaturally the substantially liquidfree permeation zone  may have any of the properties or characteristics described herein including without limitation being an unheated permeation zone a permeation zone at approximately room temperature or a novacuum permeation zone and in embodiments may further comprise a lowpressure vacuum applicator to which the permeation zone is responsive in some embodiments applying a low pressure vacuum may involve applying up to  inches of mercury and a lowpressure vacuum applicator may be an up to  inches of mercury lowpressure vacuum applicatorpermeating may comprise the step of integrating the substantially dry permeable foodstuff  with the substantially dry agent substance  the substantially dry agent substance  as a result of integration may be distributed or permeated through the body of the foodstuff  in whole or in part such as to be infused or embedded into the body of the foodstuff as opposed to merely coating the surface of the foodstuff  with the agent substance  in this manner an agent permeated foodstuff  may be formed or created in some embodiments the agent permeated foodstuff  may be a rinseproof agent permeated foodstuff  in as much as the agent substance  may not be able to be simply rinsed off of a surface of the agent permeated foodstuff the method  may result in creating an agent permeated foodstuff  from the substantially dry agent substance  and the substantially dry foodstuff  in some embodiments the method  may include integrating the foodstuff with one or more agent substances so that an agent permeated foodstuff is created consisting essentially of the foodstuff and the one or more agent substances as step  integration may follow from the steps of agitating and permeating such as wherein the agent  may be held within the permeable structure of the foodstuff  so as perhaps to become integrated with the foodstuff and impart its flavor medicinal or other characteristics to the agent permeated foodstuff  accordingly an agitation device  may have an agent permeated foodstuff output  responsive to the substantially liquidfree agitation area as perhaps best shown in figs  and  an exemplary agent permeated foodstuff  is illustrated in this example the agent permeated foodstuff  is a coffee agent permeated raisin foodstuff a the coffee flavor agent permeated raisin foodstuff a may be formed according to the foodstuff and agent substance integration method  shown in fig  in some embodiments the method  may begin  and a foodstuff  such as a raisin foodstuff a and one or more agent substances  such as a coffee agent substance a ground cinnamon powder etc  may be added into an agitation device  to form a combination consisting essentially

having a tumbler capacity of up to  pounds up to  pounds up to  pounds up to  pounds up to  pounds up to  pounds up to  pounds up to  pounds and the likethe method  may include agitating a combination of a foodstuff  and one or more agent substances  within an agitation device  for a period of time preferably in the absence of any additives in step  in further embodiments the foodstuff  and agent substance  may be agitated in the device  for a period of time in the absence of any additives including lipids waxes oils food polymers aqueous solutions water cereal fructan plasticizer gum fruit juice syrups and polymeric coatings which are typically used to adhere affix or otherwise coat flavors cereals and the like to foodstuffin some embodiments the period of agitating time may be approximately  minutes to  hours in preferred embodiments the period of time may be approximately at least one hour in further embodiments the period of time may be approximately one hour to twelve hours in still further embodiments the period of time may be approximately  minutes to  hours some embodiments may involve long tumbling such as perhaps for a duration longer than typically commercially employed when tumbling the relevant kinds of foodstuffs and agents in some embodiments long tumbling may involve tumbling for at least  hours at least  hours at least  hours or perhaps even longer moreover any suitable tumbling rate may be utilized consistent with the inventive principles described herein including perhaps tumbling at a generally moderate rate or perhaps in various embodiments from one or more revolutions of an agitation chamber  per minute or perhaps from  percent to  percent of a maximum rate of a tumbler accordingly a tumbler in various embodiments may include a longduration tumbler an at least hour tumbler an at least hour tumbler an at least hour tumbler and tumblers having an appropriate rate specification and operational duration specification and the likenow with reference primarily to fig  embodiments also may involve tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity as wherein a tumbler type agitation device  may not be filled to its capacity with the relevant foodstuff and flavor agent to be tumbled and indeed perhaps may be filled to substantially less than its capacity any suitable total tumbler type agitation device  capacity may be utilized consistent with the inventive principles described herein and tumbling in various embodiments may involve for example tumbling with a tumbler type agitation device  having a capacity of up to  pounds tumbling with a tumbler type agitation device  having a capacity of up to  pounds tumbling with a tumbler type agitation device  having a capacity of up to  pounds tumbling with a tumbler type agitation device  having a capacity of up to  pounds and the like tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity in various embodiments may involve for example tumbling at up to  percent of a tumbler type agitation device  capacity tumbling at up to  percent of a tumbler type agitation device  capacity tumbling at up to  percent of tumbler type agitation device  capacity and the like however any limited tumbler capacity capable of effecting the inventive principles discussed below may be utilized consistent with the inventive principles discussed hereinaccordingly a tumbler type agitation device  in various embodiments may be a lowload tumbler type agitation device  which may involve tumblers with a lowload capacity up to  percent tumbler capacity load tumblers with a lowload capacity up to  percent tumbler capacity load tumblers with a lowload capacity up to  percent tumbler capacity load and the likenow with reference primarily to fig  tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity in various embodiments may have the effect of expanding tumbling space for a substantially dry agent substance  and a substantially dry foodstuff  unlike a tumbler type agitation device  filled with a foodstuff and agent substance to capacity near capacity or even simply a substantial capacity an expanded tumbling space of a tumbler type agitation device  filled to a limited tumbler capacity may allow the foodstuff and agent substance more space in which to agitate rather than being held back by the overall mass of the foodstuff and agent substance as may be the case with conventionally filled tumbler type agitation device  the expanded tumbling space of a limited capacity tumbler type agitation device  may allow both the foodstuff  and the agent  greater freedoms of motion such as the ability to translate more freely rotate more freely and the like this may increase the degree intensity or the like of the agitation perhaps increasing the effectiveness of the permeation of the foodstuff  with the agent  accordingly a lowload tumbler type agitation device  may have an expanded tumble space  having any of the expanded tumbling space properties and characteristics described herein and which of course may response to a substantially dry agent substance input  and a substantially dry permeable foodstuff input tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity in various embodiments also may have the effect of increasing tumbling contact for a substantially dry agent substance  and a substantially dry foodstuff  it may be appreciated that contact between the agent and foodstuff may be a prerequisite for integrating the foodstuff with the agent substance it may follow that the greater the degree of contact the greater the opportunity for inegration and perhaps the greater the effectiveness of creating an agent permeated foodstuff  tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity may promote increased tumbling contact such as perhaps by reducing restrictions on the movement of tumbled foodstuffs and agents and promoting their ability to interact with one another accordingly a lowload tumbler type agitation device  may have an increased tumble contact range  having any of the increased tumbling contact properties and characteristics described herein and which of course may response to a substantially dry agent input  and a substantially dry permeable foodstuff input tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity in various embodiments additionally may have the effect of promoting substantially clumpless tumbling unlike conventional processes wherein the end result of tumbling may result in clumping of created agent permeated foodstuff  tumbling at a limited tumbler capacity may reduce the opportunities for clumping to occur such as by reducing the overall density of the tumbled foodstuffs and agents this further may result in avoiding the need for posttumbling declumping measures accordingly a lowload tumbler type agitation device  may be in some embodiments a substantially clumpless tumbler having any of the clumpless tumbling properties and characteristics described herein and which of course may have a posttumbler declumpfree egressnow with further
