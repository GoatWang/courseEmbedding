oklahoma city real people  real reviews  real results by far the best bank i work with you will not regret it even though it is located in san provider name locked  the mobile banking makes it really easy to deposit checks costumer service is excellent when your working with them  donny l provider name locked was the absolute worst insurance company ive had the displeasure to deal with  one of my trucks was destroyed in a may  tornado  the claims process was a true nightmare  on my latemodel truck the damage was a crushed bed broken glass and other damage while the damage to my  ford f was complete and total  it took a great deal of work on my part to keep them from totalling the dodge provider name locked diesel pickup  it took me to go out and source parts and such to keep the damage threshold below their total limits which seemed to me as i was doing the work they shouldve been doing  thats not all the  ford was my dads truck and i had two professional independent appraisals done on the truck for  and   the provider name locked adjuster offered me a whopping  for the truck  the adjuster claimed that the truck was missing the original air conditioning system the truck never had air ever and that a color change affected the value significantly never mind the color change was complete to include every square inch of the truck with the exclusion of the very bottom of the firewall  he also claimed the color change was to a nonstock color it was ford blue and was painted ford red  he knew absolutely nothing about ford trucks at all  the ended up going to an arbitrator of the oklahoma insurance department where the claim was settled at less than k and i kept the truck remains i wholeheartedly recommend you run away from provider name locked   do not take them at their word ever  i learned a k mistake the hard way in dealing with provider name locked   i cancelled my policy with them the day i got the dodge out of the body shop and sent them a letter stating why i did so  to add insult to it all they kept sending me come back we miss you mailings for the next seven years  no way provider name locked   patrick d i have been a member of provider name locked since i married my husband  years ago he has been a member since  the representatives on the phone are professional and helpful in revising insurance coverage and handling claims i revised my automobile policy recently online and it was quite easy other insurance companies may be a little cheaper but provider name locked s service is unmatched  suzanne t join angies list to view providers
