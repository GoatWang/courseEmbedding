accompanying notes are an integral part of these interim financial statements        golden star resource corp notes to interim financial statements december   stated in us dollars unaudited    nature of operations   organization   the company was incorporated in the state of nevada usa on april     exploration stage activities   the company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining claims upon location of a commercial minable reserve the company expects to actively prepare the site for its extraction and enter a development stage during the fiscal year  the company entered into an agreement with mayan mineral ltd to acquire a resource property in nevada note  currently the company is actively looking for other mineral properties for its planned business operation   going concern   these unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “us gaap” applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business   the general business strategy of the company is to acquire and explore mineral properties the continued operations of the company and the recoverability of mineral property costs is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable mineral reserves the ability of the company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of its properties and upon future profitable production the company has not generated any revenues or completed development of any properties to date further the company has a working capital deficit of  june     has incurred losses of  since inception and further significant losses are expected to be incurred in the exploration and development of its mineral properties the company will require additional funds to meet its obligations and maintain its operations there can be no guarantee that the company will be successful in raising the necessary financing management’s plans in this regard are to raise equity financing as required   these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern these unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty    summary of significant accounting policies   the unaudited interim financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with us gaap because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment actual results may vary from these estimates the unaudited interim financial statements have in management’s opinion been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below        golden star resource corp notes to interim financial statements december   stated in us dollars unaudited    summary of significant accounting policies continued     a cash   the company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents there are no cash equivalents as at december   june   nil     b mineral property acquisition payments   the company expenses all costs incurred on mineral properties to which it has secured exploration rights prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves if and when proven and probable reserves are determined for a property and a feasibility study prepared with respect to the property then subsequent exploration and development costs of the property will be capitalized   the company regularly performs evaluations of any investment in mineral properties to assess the recoverability andor the residual value of its investments in these assets all longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable     c exploration expenditures   the company follows a policy of expensing exploration expenditures until a production decision in respect of the project and the company is reasonably assured that it will receive regulatory approval to permit mining operations which may include the receipt of a legally binding project approval certificate     d asset retirement obligations   the company has adopted asc  “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which requires that an asset retirement obligation “aro” associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset be recognized as a liability in the period which it is incurred and becomes determinable with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset   the cost of the tangible asset including the initially recognized aro is depleted such that the cost of the aro is recognized over the useful life of the asset the aro is recorded at fair value and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value the fair value of the aro is measured using expected future cash flow discounted at the company’s creditadjusted riskfree interest rate to date no significant asset retirement obligation exists due to the early stage of exploration accordingly no liability has been recorded        golden star resource corp notes to interim financial statements december   stated in us dollars unaudited    summary of significant accounting policies continued     e use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of unaudited interim financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates     f financial instruments   asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value   level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are either directly or indirectly observable and   level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing   the company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash accounts payable and accrued liabilities loan payable and due to a related party pursuant to asc  the fair value of our cash is determined based on “level ” inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets the company believes that the recorded values of all of the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations   the company’s operations are in canada which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates the financial risk is the risk to the company’s operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates currently the company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk        golden star resource corp notes to interim financial statements december   stated in us dollars unaudited    summary of significant accounting policies continued     g income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  “accounting for income taxes” and asc  —accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which require the liability method of accounting for income taxes the liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities     h basic and diluted net loss per share   the company reports basic loss per share in accordance with asc  – “earnings per share” basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share because there are no potential dilutive securities     i foreign currency translation   the company’s functional currency is the us dollar transactions in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date nonmonetary items are translated at the historical rate unless such items are carried at market value in which case they are translated using exchange rates that existed when the value were determined any resulting exchange rate differences are recorded in the statement of operations    recent adopted and new accounting pronouncements   in may  the fasb issued guidance to remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share practical expedient the guidance is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal  and early adoption is permitted adoption of the new guidance effective for the quarter beginning october   had no impact on the company’s balance sheets or statements of operations or cash flows   in august  the fasb issued guidance on how to account for and disclose going concern risk the guidance is effective

liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal  and earlier adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its financial statements        golden star resource corp notes to interim financial statements december   stated in us dollars unaudited    recent adopted and new accounting pronouncements continued   in june  the fasb issued guidance that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets under the new guidance credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses the new guidance also modifies the impairment models for available forsale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination the guidance is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal  and earlier adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its financial statements    mineral claim interest   on august   the company entered into a quitclaim deed the “deed” with kee nez resources llc

this section of the quarterly report includes a number of forwardlooking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance forwardlooking statements are often identified by words like believe expect estimate anticipate intend project and similar expressions or words which by their nature refer to future events you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements which apply only as of the date of this prospectus these forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions   plan of operation   we are a startup exploration stage corporation and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion during the year end audit this means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated any revenues and do not anticipate generating any revenues until we begin removing and selling minerals there is no assurance we will ever achieve these goals accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than the sale of minerals in order to implement our project and stay in business our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others   our exploration target is to find a mineralized material specifically an ore body containing gold our success depends upon finding mineralized material this includes a determination by our consultant that the property contains reserves we have not yet selected a consultant mineralized material is a mineralized body which has been delineated by appropriate spaced drilling or underground sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metals to justify removal if we don’t find mineralized material or if it is not economically feasible to remove it we will cease operations and you will lose your investment   in addition we may not have enough money to complete the acquisition and exploration of a property if it turns out that we have not raised enough money to complete our acquisition we will try to raise additional funds from a second public offering a private placement or through loans at the present time we have not made any plans to raise additional money and there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional money in the future if we need additional money and cannot raise it we will have to suspend or cease operations   research  development   as an exploration stage company in the mining industry we are not involved in any research and development   effects of compliance with environmental laws   as a company in the mining industry we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations we strive to comply with all applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations are currently taking the steps indicated above we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations on environmental matters these laws and regulations on federal state and local levels are evolving and frequently modified and we cannot predict accurately the effect if any they will have on its business in the future in many instances the regulations have not been finalized or are frequently being modified even where regulations have been adopted they are subject to varying and contradicting interpretations and implementation in some cases compliance can only be achieved by capital expenditure and we cannot accurately predict what capital expenditures if any may be required        limited operating history need for additional capital   there is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance we are an exploration stage corporation and have not generated any revenues from operations we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources possible delays in the acquisition and exploration of our properties and possible cost overruns due to price increases in services   to become profitable and competitive we need to identify a property and conduct research and explore our property before we start production of any minerals we may find if we do find mineralized material we will need additional funding to move beyond the research and exploration stage we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders   liquidity and capital resources   we have completed our public offering as of march   and to date have raised  we will attempt to raise additional money through a subsequent private placement public offering or through loans   currently we do not have sufficient funds for our intended business operation ms miller one of our officers and directors has agreed in financing the related operating expenditures to maintain the company the foregoing agreement is oral we have nothing in writing while ms miller has agreed to advance the funds the agreement is unenforceable as a matter of law because no consideration was given at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash if we need additional cash and can’t raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans   since inception we have issued  shares of our common stock and received    in april  we issued  shares of common stock to kathrine macdonald our former

properties   summary   the following is a description of the company’s mineral properties the company holds a  interest on four contiguous federal blm unpatented lode mining claims in nevada that were acquired for mineral exploration purposes primarily in exploration for precious metals   the property   the four gsr lode mining claims named gsr    and  were staked on federal blm lands on july   by kee nez resources llc a utah limited liability company the blm claim numbers for claims gsr    and  are    and  respectively each of the four claims are  acres in size for a total of  acres   the company acquired these unpatented claims on august   from kee nez resources llc who quitclaimed the four claims to the company this transfer was filed and recorded with the blm on august   as a result golden star resource corp holds a  interest in the four claims there are no underlying agreements or royalties   a maintenance fee or a maintenance fee waiver certification must be filed annually on or before september st in order to keep the claims valid and is filed in advance for the upcoming assessment year since the company holds less than  federal unpatented lode mining claims it is entitled to file a maintenance fee waiver certification in lieu of paying the fee of  per claim payment of the maintenance fee or filing of the fee waiver certification is the responsibility of golden star resource corp notice of holding of these claims is also filed annually with churchill county all requirements have been met until the next annual due date of september     there are no buildings equipment or other facilities on the claims sources of power and water have not been investigated to date   the company only has mineral rights by virtue of these claims it does not hold any surface rights   location   the gsr  unpatented lode mining claims are situated in sections  and  tn re mdm in churchill county nevada   the property is located  air miles southeast of reno nv and  air miles southeast of fallon nv the property can be accessed from fallon by heading east on us hwy  for  miles and then heading south on nv  for  miles this paved highway cuts across the southeast corner of the claim group see fig         location map     click to enlarge        claim map     click to enlarge        geology   the gsr property lies in the basin and range province near its western margin where it adjoins the northwestsoutheast trending walker lane mineral belt this boundary is about  miles west of the gsr property the basin and range province is a major physiographic region of the western us centered on nevada and western utah typified by northnortheast trending mountain ranges separated by broad flat alluvium filled valleys gold and silver mineralization is known to occur in many parts of this province   in the vicinity of the gsr property there are numerous historical small mine workings in the surrounding mountain ranges an active exploration project at bell mt  miles to the northwest and several past producing large gold mines such as paradise peak  miles to the southeast and rawhide  miles to the west   the nearsurface rocks in the area of the gsr property are a series of suboutcropping mesozoic age metasedimentary rocks overlain by tertiary age rhyolitic lavas and volcanoclastics   no exploration has been carried out on the property by gsr and it has not been examined by a gsr contracted professional geologist or by gsr’s officers or directors   due to current subdued market conditions in the junior natural resource markets the company has no plans for an exploration program until it has the ability to raise sufficient funds to engage in an exploration program such a program would likely initially entail prospecting geological mapping and rockchip sampling quality assurance and quality controls for sampling collection protocols will be developed with the exploration program as funding allows there would be no permitting or bonding requirements for this preliminary phase of exploration permits and bonding would be required if and when exploration advanced to a drilling or trenching phase since those activities cause surface disturbance   the property is currently without any known reserves and any program to be proposed in the future would be exploratory in nature   item  exhibits   the following documents are included
