irwindentist reviewsratings for dr spencer e schwartz staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgedr schwartz is one of the best dentists ive had the pleasure of shadowing i shadowed at his practice as a student for a few months and was blown away by how thorough and detail oriented he is in all of his procedures he makes sure the patient is always aware of the procedure and cost he knows a lot about insurance and insurance policies and will make sure you get your moneys worth was this rating useful  flag  submitted april   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgedr schwartz is the best dentist i know hes extremely thorough in his examinations and gives you all your options he takes pictures of everything going on and takes the time to explain exactly whats wrong and why as a patient you can tell he really has your best interest at heart hes very detailed in his work and does everything in his power to make the procedure successful also ive never seen a dentist administer a shot as painlessly as dr schwartz his attention to detail is incredible extremely professional using the laser is also huge advantage you wont get in other offices painless i definitely recommend him youll get your moneys worth was this rating useful  flag  submitted april   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgewell where do i start the dentist himself had a  minute conversation to me about how bad my insurance is and how he gets paid a flat fee he didnt seem to do a dental exam because he wont get paid i told him this is what i have from my company and if he didnt like it why take this insurance i went to this at this specificity time because my filling had fallen out i asked him to fix it since it looked like my tooth would crack if he didnt he then proceeded to lecture me how he cant do it because its another persons work he cant fix someone else mistake according to him well this filling was done  years prior so it wasnt a mistake and i think its highly unprofessional to discuss payment issues with a client not only did he seem like a fake dentist because he seemed like he should of been a professor instead of a dentist but he had a suit on with several holes in the arm and leg it seemed as though it was from a thrift shop i actually googled him after the visit to make sure this was really him sketchy man and sketchy office dont waste ur time go elsewhere please was this rating useful  flag  submitted december   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgeim so grateful to dr schwartz  his staff ive been a patient there for a few years now most recently bridgework my other dentist had done was no good id only had the bridge for a few years now im out of work and needed major work done his staff helped me get carecredit and was very helpful with the process also my other dentist connected the teeth and they looked very fake dr schwartz made individual crowns for the from teeth and was able to save my teeth the color is better and they look more real than the ones i had before what a difference dr schwartz was very thorough  very patient the work wasnt cheap but i felt like he really cared about my interests even after cementing the crowns he said if i wanted any changes after  days hed help me but the work was good and my wife liked it too my smile just feels so much more natural than before i recommend dr schwartzwas this rating useful  flag  submitted june   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei just left dr schwartzs office after a terrible customer service experience as a new patient in scheduling a routine cleaning appointment it was not communicated to me by the receptionist that a consultation by the dentist was required prior to cleaning my teeth i received no confirmation of my appointment prior to today even though over the phone i was told i would receive one by email even though the office was supposed to open at am there was no answer to my calls or the voice message i left between  and am so after showing up early i waited in the waiting area for  minutes while the receptionist ate her breakfast and made some personal phone calls when i was finally called into the office by the hygienist i was told that the dentist was not going to come in today and that they would need to take x rays for him to review and i would need to schedule a follow up appointment for my cleaning after explaining how inconvenienced i was having called out of work for this appointment i was merely told that this was their policy no apology no effort to even try and fix the situation i left and will be finding a new dentist i have no idea whether dr schwartz is a good dentist but from the quality of the staff he hires and the way his office is run i cannot recommend using himwas this rating useful  flag  submitted may   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei highly highly highly would recommend drschwartz to anyone my front tooth broke off completely only the root at the gum was there i thought it was hopeless but he was able to put a brand new tooth on there in an hour he didnt cause me any pain either i was very comfortable with him and his staff theyre all very nicedr schwartz also explained everything to me and showed me examples of his work he really helped me understand what he was doing and what my options were im still amazed he was able to build a tooth up from nothing also they got me in right away thank you so much dr schwartz for saving my tooth  smilewas this rating useful  flag  submitted january   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei was in such pain i went to this lady dentist she looked at my xray and said i needed an extraction but i didnt want to lose my tooth so i called my insurance and they signed me with drschwartz he did a very careful exam he told me my tooth could be saved and explained it well he shows me pictures of what had to be done and that really helped me understand what was going on drschwartz did a root canal and filled my tooth he did a great job no more pain  i brought my kids to dr schwartz and would recommend him to anyone the staff is really nice too very friendly i was very impressed by the equipment he had too very up to datewas this rating useful  flag  submitted september   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei chipped my front teeth and visited two other offices they told me i had to get crowns which wouldnt have been covered by my insurance dr schwartz said i could just bond them he did the bonding and they have stayed in ever since ive been going to his office ever since he also did this laser treatment on my gums to make my teeth look better it didnt hurt at all i take my  children too theyve never had a cavity dr s also takes lots of pictures on the computer to show me what hes doing he explains it very well and he never rushes they always get in touch with me to let me know when its time for my  month check up pon and annette are very nice too they treat everyone nicelywas this rating useful  flag  submitted june   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgeive been dr schwartzs patient for years now any patient would be lucky to have a dentist like dr schwartz he keeps uptodate very thorough and does excellent work he does laser work which i found very impressive he did implant surgery on me and i barely felt any discomfort he also uses a camera while working and explains everything to me he really likes for me to understand what hes doing he also told me all my choices i got implants which cost lots of money and my insurance barely paid anything the thing is he wasnt after money he told me i could have my teeth replaced with something very simple that my insurance would have covered i dont know too many dentists and doctors that are that up front with patients his staff is very nice and theyve been with him the whole time hes been there that says lots about him too i recommend all my friends  family see dr schwartzwas this rating useful  flag  submitted june   staff punctuality helpfulness knowledgei went to him for a checkup and he decided that i had one cavity but wanted to redo all my old fillings since they were old and silver stupid me listened the next visit he was cavity filling happy and when i felt a pain he said oh i dont know why you feel the pain but he continued his work and on the other side realized i needed a root canal it took him many tries to finish filing the fillings there was no way i was going to let him do a root canal i still feel he did a lousy job on at least one of the fillingsi would never go back to him and wish my insurance would not pay since i probably have to get it refilled or something lousy dentist i wish i saw these reviews before i went to himwas this rating useful  flag  submitted july   rate this doctordr spencer e
