over the networks of the cable providers twc brings not only a sizable number of business and residential subscribers to the new company but access to content as well operations twc also operates local news broadcasting stations in new york including new york city north carolina and texas regional sports networks as well as a news sports and entertainment online portal the company generates about  of revenue from its residential services business services and advertising account for about  and  respectively geographic reach its core service areas are in new york the midwest texas the

competitors such as netflix and hulu via its isp such services could eat into twcs more profitable cable business another potential problem for twc is the federal communications commissions vote to

improving the quality and reliability of its residential products and offering distinguished customer service twc expects to see continued strong growth in its business services segment it predicts revenue of more than  billion from those offerings by  mergers and acquisitions acquisitions have played their part in twcs strategy in  the company closed its acquisition of dukenet communications

and gary sterling represent a putative class of former and current residents of  separately licensed skilled nursing facilities that are in the business of providing longterm hour care for the elderly and disabled hereafter plaintiffs respondents are interrelated business entities that own and operate the skilled nursing facilities hereafter collectively referred to as covenant plaintiffs sued covenant alleging among other things that it consistently and intentionally failed to provide adequate nursing staff for its elderly and disabled residents and that covenant misrepresented its staffing levels to residents and to the consuming public plaintiffs alleged three causes of action in their first amended complaint fac  violation of a skilled nursing resident‟s right to reside in an adequately staffed facility health  saf code §  subd b  violation of california‟s unfair competition law ucl bus  prof code §  et seq and  violation of the consumers legal remedies act clra civ code §  et seq plaintiffs alleged that the inadequacy of the staffing levels at covenant‟s facilities was demonstrated by its noncompliance with the statutory mandate that a skilled nursing facility maintain a minimum numeric ratio of  nursing hours per patient per day nhppd see §  subd a covenant filed a demurrer urging the court to dismiss this dispute because a skilled nursing facility‟s obligation to provide its residents care at a level of  nhppd is not enforceable by a private right of action it argued that because section  is a regulatory statute it can only be enforced by the california department of public health cdph in addition covenant warned that litigating the case would necessarily involve the court in a “regulatory thicket‟of nursing home staffing regulations” that is best left to administrative expertise covenant urged the court to dismiss based on the abstention doctrine the trial court agreed with both arguments and dismissed plaintiffs‟ lawsuit without leave to amend in the published portion of this opinion we first conclude that while section  subdivision a may not create a private right of action section  subdivision b does thereby allowing plaintiffs to sue under this latter statute for a violation of section  subdivision a as to the court‟s invocation of the abstention doctrine at this stage of the proceedings it is not clear that adjudicating plaintiffs‟ claims “would require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency or to interfere with the functions of an administrative agency citations” alvarado v selma convalescent hospital   calappth   alvarado even if otherwise appropriate the fac contained nonequitable claims for relief including damages that are not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of equitable abstention therefore we reverse the demurrer as to plaintiffs‟ first cause of action seeking relief under section  subdivision b in the nonpublished portion of this opinion we likewise reverse the trial court‟s dismissal of the ucl and clra causes of action   click to view the full text pdf of the courts decision shuts v covenant holdco llc   judges ignazio j ruvolo jurisdiction

companies which own and control those licensees directly or indirectly plaintiffs allege california nurses association legal terms of responsibilities imposed on a skilled nursing facility the plain purpose of this decline to adjudicate only equitable claims see alvarado  calappth at p  facilities” the first amended complaint indicates that cameron shuts brings this action in in alvarado claimed that “defendants engaged in a pervasive and intentional failure to equipped citation” alvarado at pp  fn omitted because regulatory commercial markets for goods and services citation‟ citation” mckell v authorized skilled nursing facility residents themselves to bring actions to remedy ehc management llc as amicus curiae on a aarp foundation litigation barbara jones we agree with this analytical framework as wehlage makes clear in order to hooper lundy  bookman mark e reagan allegation that defendant failed to disclose to consumers that it sold motor fuel at a be cured by amendment” on the doctrine of equitable abstention to dismiss plaintiffs‟ section  subdivision b the rights of a resident of a skilled nursing facility as set forth in the patient‟s bill of class action against a skilled nursing facility and  of its affiliates under california‟s whether covenant violated the ucl and clra by representing their services have clra civ code §§  et seq the court dismissed these two causes of action for  klein supra  calappth at p  in determining whether the court made case without leave to amend on both grounds the court‟s judgment of dismissal was was demonstrated by its noncompliance with the statutory mandate that a skilled nursing nhppd the minimum number of actual nursing hours per patient required in a skilled costs on appeal are awarded to plaintiffs matter over to cdph represents an unwarranted frustration of the legislature‟s desire to calappth   holding that absent a legislative determination a court could salisbury  p  noting that trial court correctly declined to “abstain from adjudicating the regulatory guidance when a plaintiff essentially is asking the court to make an economic entirely speculative see klein supra  calappth at p  fact that plaintiffs‟ misrepresented that their services are of a particular quality or standard when in fact they specified price per gallon without adjusting for temperature expansion or disclosing the reasonableness of the conduct in question‟ citations” id at p  the court by section  subdivision b a statute which was never invoked by the plaintiffs in appellants to state a cause of action for reasons that were not raised in covenant‟s demurrer or division four  curiae on behalf of plaintiffs and appellants alameda county subdivision b in  it expanded rather than narrowed the scope of the legislation to filed  action see wehlage supra  fsuppd at p  “that the cdph may enforce trial judge hon winifred younge smith first appellate district the cdph has recently published a series of detailed “all subdivision a “does not provide a right of action under state law    ” wehlage care provided at a skilled nursing facility does not come within clra‟s definition of job conducting surveys issuing deficiencies and remedying them when appropriate    ” his capacity as “successorininterest and personallegal representative” of charles shuts adjudicating a suit that seeks equitable remedies if “granting the requested relief would mckenna long  aldridge christopher j patient of a skilled nursing facility” to “bring a civil action against the licensee of a on an unnecessary burden in monitoring or enforcing injunctive relief where other more calth   consequently these cases recognize that the ucl and the clra continue”  period the other named plaintiff in the first amended
