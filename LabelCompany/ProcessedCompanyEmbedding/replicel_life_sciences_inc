phase  trial will enroll  male subjects in good health with mild to moderate androgenetic alopecia  dermal sheath cup cells will be isolated from a small punch biopsy taken from the back of the subject’s scalp  these cells will be replicated and then reintroduced into balding areas on the subjects scalp  after injections are performed subjects will return to the clinic for assessment of total terminal and vellus hair density and cumulative hair thickness as well safety  participants will remain in the trial for approximately  months rch is now under clinical investigation at tokyo

sciences is developing an autologous cellbased procedure for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia pattern baldness and general hair loss in men and women the procedure has the potential to become the first minimally invasive solution for hair loss what causes hair lossno one is  certain of what all the contributing factors may be in hair loss however it is believed that there is a link between male pattern baldness mpb also known as androgenetic alopecia and androgenic hormones in males a hormone known as dihydrotestosterone dht triggers androgen receptors in hair follicles on the top of the scalp this activation of the hormone receptors changes the cells and reduces their cell growth activity over time the hair follicle miniaturizes causing each successive growth cycle to get shorter and the hair follicles get thinner and smaller the large terminal hair follicles turn into tiny unpigmented vellus hair follicles eventually the follicles are no longer able to function properly and they completely disappear in men though in women the follicles usually survive in their miniaturized state in men balding typically starts on the top of the head in some men the hair loss can progress until there is nothing left but a fringe of hair around the bottom half of the head women’s hair loss is quite different from male pattern baldness as the hair loss pattern is usually a diffuse thinning over the top of the scalp but it too is primarily hormonally driven it has been noted that both the number of androgen receptors and the level of alpha reductase which converts testosterone to dht are higher in hair follicles on top of the scalp than in the rest of the scalp this may partly explain why hair loss occurs in hair follicles on top of the scalp while hair follicles at the back and sides of the scalp seem more resistant to the androgen hormones in addition to androgens causing pattern baldness it is believed that there are other factors that contribute to the condition along the way some suggest that inflammation may also contribute to hair loss sometimes but not always hair follicles that are in the process of miniaturizing have inflammatory cells around them a possible explanation for this inflammatory cells activity may be that elevated androgens also trigger increased sebum production favoring an excess microbial and parasitic population leading to inflammation of the hair follicle doctors have found a strong correlation between early onset extensive hair loss and heart disease so there may be a common etiology outside the androgen paradigm for pattern loss for more information on hair loss please visit wwwkeratincomcurrent treatmentssurgical hair restoration medical hair restoration consists of a variety of surgical hair restoration treatments designed to reduce baldness follicular unit hair transplant “fut” surgery is by far the dominant hair restoration treatment and involves the surgical removal of large portions of hairbearing scalp from the back of the head these sections of scalp skin are then dissected by hand into smaller hair follicle clusters follicular units and transplanted to the balding areas of a patient’s scalp scalp flap surgery scalp reduction surgery and scalp expansion surgery are other forms of surgical hair restoration combined these treatments represent a far smaller patient base than hair transplant surgery follicular unit extraction or “fue” is another type of hair transplant technique in which a small round punch is used to extract follicular units from a patient’s baldnessresistant donor area  these    and hair follicular unit grafts are then transplanted into a patient’s balding areas  this is a time consuming and tedious procedure and a physician is often limited to transplanting only  to  follicular unit grafts in one day which means a patient often has to come in a number of times to achieve the desired result  while the fue procedure has grown in popularity largely due to the minimally invasive way in which follicular unit grafts are removed the standard strip excision method is still the leading hair transplant procedure however fut and fue hair transplant surgery will always be limited by the availability and quality of donor hair follicles hair replacement surgery is a complicated procedure that may require several hair transplant sessions over a period of onetotwo years before the desired result is achieved ultimately the act of hair transplantation does not ‘create’ new hair the process simply relocates viable hair from the back of the scalp to the front most women will not undergo this extremely invasive surgery  in terms of cosmetic results both fut and fue surgery are quite dependent upon the skill of the surgeon nonsurgical restoration only two hair restoration treatments approved by the united states food and drug administration “fda” are available today minoxidil and finasteride minoxidil is marketed as rogaine® finasteride is marketed as propecia® these two products can be effective in hair loss prevention and may grow new hair however once a patient begins using rogaine® or propecia® he or she must continue to use the products indefinitely if an individual stops using the drug any new hair grown as a result of the drug will likely fall out as with any drug adverse reactions can sometimes occur rogaine® minoxidil rogaine® minoxidil was introduced in  as the first drug approved for treatment of baldness by the fda it is now available overthecounter in several countries including the usa minoxidil remains the only product available without a prescription that has been approved by the fda as a proven treatment against hair loss minoxidil is no longer under patent so it is also marketed as a number of topical treatments made by several different companies  minoxidil stimulates hair growth in individuals with male and female pattern baldness however the mechanism of action is unknown  it comes in  and  topical formulations and known side effects include itching and skin irritation of the treated scalp as well as unwanted hair in areas adjacent to treatment sites which can be distressing to women when the face is involved  once treatment is stopped all results will be lost within  to  months propecia® finasteride finasteride is marketed by merck under the trademark names proscar® and propecia® among other generic names  it is a synthetic antiandrogen that inhibits type ii alpha reductase the enzyme that converts testosterone to dht  only available by prescription it was developed to treat mild to moderate male pattern hair loss on the vertex top of head and anterior midscalp area middle front of head in men only there is insufficient evidence that propecia® works for receding hairlines at the temples  listed side effects include erectile dysfunction and depression  once treatment is stopped all results will be lost within  to  months news releases  replicel

treatment as quickly as possible to men who suffer from pattern baldness the asrm route to market does not come with the coveted japanese nhi insurance coverage but the indication is one that doesn�t necessarily need the nhi insurance coverage incentive to work shiseido already has opened the shiseido cellprocessing and expansion center spec in kobe and is using this location as its base to develop and eventually provide the therapy not many nonjapanese companies understand the asrm route to market but it is one that a relatively wellknown regenerative medicine company cytori therapeutics has already received multiple approvals for over the years and is a very real and relatively fast route to market that exists in japan i would keep my eyes peeled on replicel and shiseido

with the trial and the product manufactured by shiseido  the firm notes that early commercialization of the product is possible in japan the life sciences report interview with eden rahim  i do like replicel life sciences inc a microcap canadian regenerative medicine company with a novel technology developing autologous cell therapies whats interesting about replicel is that it has four novel programs on the go and management has secured a partnership with shiseido company in japan to fund its alopecia trials rch for pattern baldness could be on the market in  the company has developed a dermal injector device rci to pair with its therapeutic approach it will file for ce mark approval of the dermal injector in the european union eu later this year and i think the product will be on the market in europe in  management has been able to derisk this little company in a way many small companies havent been able to do  the dermal injector is a novel instrument with extreme precision that sources the cells in the scalp it has an analgesic delivery capability built in so it can simultaneously anesthetize the skin and obtain autologous dermal sheath cells it will have many applications  replicel wont market the product itself but will partner that out the company could have the alopecia therapy on the market in japan in  and the dermal injector could be on the market in the eu in   the device is a catalyst even though replicel will have data in the alopecia and tendon repair indications later this year i think dermal injector may carry more weight because the market may realize it represents the fastest route to commercialization and revenues which would help the company mitigate some of its cash burn the adoption and costs to market the device are much less than they would be for developing and commercializing a therapeutic read more  the life sciences report interview with alan leong  replicel life sciences inc greets the new year with new ceo lee buckler

progress made in advancing all replicel hairfollicle derived cell therapies into formal clinical testing the life sciences report interview with alan leong  replicel life sciences inc caught my attention because of its hair regeneration or restoration technology that may not be the application that first goes commercial but its interesting and theres a lot of money in this area  replicel has a way of using dermalrelated cells that is far less invasive  the companys technology can be used to regenerate hair and a related technology can be used to repair tendons for patients with tendinitis or major tendon injuries interestingly because of the nature of the cells replicel is using and its process cost and scale arent issues other scientists give it a thumbs up saying the science is good the company is currently in a set of phase  and  trials for both the hair regeneration and for tendon repair early results seem to be very good replicel is under the radar it based in vancouver

shows signs of healing chronic tendon problems news provided by replicel life sciences inc mar    et share this article firstinhuman clinical study meets primary endpoint demonstrating product safety and clinical potential for tendon regeneration and healing vancouver march   prnewswire replicel life sciences inc otcqb repcf tsxv rp frapp replicel or the company is pleased to report compelling safety and clinical data from its phase  tendon repair study investigating the use of replicels type  collagenexpressing hair folliclederived fibroblasts rct as a treatment for achilles tendinosis the clinical trial met its goal of establishing a complete safety profile at  months and showed no serious adverse events related to the study treatment or injection procedure additionally each of the treated participants all of whom suffered chronic tendon pain and loss of function over an extended period of time with no recovery from standard treatments showed numerous clinically important improvements by various measures including tendon composition blood supply physical function and pain sensation  chronic tendinosis is a state of tendon degeneration that is very difficult to reverse as evidenced by the many therapies used to try and treat it stated dr ross davidson an orthopedic surgeon former clinical professor at the department of orthopaedics at the university of british columbia and past head physician and orthopaedic consultant for the vancouver canucks of the national hockey league nhl  this study shows exciting clinical improvements in patients with clinically diagnosed chronic achilles tendinosis who were unresponsive to standard treatments and who had suffered for many months in some cases years with frequent pain and loss of function not only did the study show several clinically important improvements in pain and function scores but several ultrasound measures clearly demonstrate a marked improvement in tendon structure something rarely seen in patients with this condition said davidson with further clinical studies this new technology could represent a cuttingedge advancement in kickstarting a healing process that results in tendon regeneration for the first time we may have a treatment that shows signs of reversing the underlying problem versus just treating the symptoms this could be a gamechanger in sports medicine dr davidson concluded the most clinically material improvements observed from the study are summarized as follows visaa scale of achilles tendon injury severity participants treated with rct in the per protocol population who completed the visaa evaluation  months after receipt of injections showed clinically relevant signals of healing including an overall  improvement in total score compared to baseline two patients showed select measures of nearcomplete recovery in function by visaa scoring vas scale of pain severity four out of five participants treated with rct who completed questionnaires  months after injection showed clinically relevant signals of improvement in pain on loading runningjumping based on vas score average improvement in vas score for the four participants was  over baseline vas score three out of five participants treated with rct who completed questionnaires  months after injection showed improvement in pain on palpation based on vas score average improvement in vas score for the three participants was  over baseline vas score two patients showed select measures of nearcomplete elimination of pain by vas scoring  this trial was to show the safety of injection of hair folliclederived nonbulbar dermal sheath cells nbds stated replicels chief medical officer dr rolf hoffman as well as to repeat the landmark trials of our collaborators who injected skinderived fibroblasts together with prp plateletrich plasma in different tendinopathies we believe the cause of healing mechanism of action in those studies was the cellular collagen production and not the prp which in our view has little clinical or commercial potential as a therapeutic product or treatment for tendon repair i am very pleased that in this trial we see some early signals of regenerative healing in some patients and because of its similar pathogenesis there is every reason to believe the ability to heal achilles tendons will extend to numerous applications including repairing the patellar tendon of the knee jumpers knee both tendons of elbow tennis elbow golfers elbow and the rotator cuff observed dr hoffmann furthermore he concluded when we have established that our cell therapy heals chronic tendon injury it may then be used by physicians for more acute injury with the goal of an approved label for these additional treatments in the future this is a major step forward in the companys development of a series of products which leverage the exciting collagenproducing capacity of these cells stated replicel ceo lee buckler our management and clinical team are very excited about the data from this trial and the potential for further development and clinical testing of this product to treat patients without good options for the tendon degeneration pain and loss of function they are experiencing buckler concluded we have captured the medical and investment communities attention and see the results of this much anticipated proofofconcept clinical study as an opportunity to advance therapies for patients and incrementally add value for shareholders in the months ahead about achilles tendinopathyachilles tendinopathy is a condition that causes pain swelling and stiffness of the achilles tendon that joins your heel bone to your calf muscles it is thought to be caused by repeated tiny injuries to the achilles tendon these may occur for a number of reasons including overuse of the tendon for example in runners treatments range from physiotherapy to antiinflammatory medications to surgery for many people symptoms of achilles tendon injury usually clear within three to six months of starting treatment however for some people the injury does not respond to treatment and progresses to chronic tendinosis there is an estimated incidence rate of  new cases of midportion achilles tendinopathy each year in north america alone according to statistics published in the british journal of sports medicine  about the rct tendon repair studythe study was designed to demonstrate the safety of a single injection of replicels rct into the achilles tendon while the study was not designed to be statistically significant for efficacy multiple measures of efficacy were incorporated to give insights into the products potential and to assist in guiding future development decisions measures of whether the product may be working included testing and scoring patient pain in various settings evaluating overall function blood flow changes in the tendon and changes in the overall density and composition of the tendon as measured by ultrasound imaging for further trial details see httpswwwclinicaltrialsgovctshownct the firstinhuman study involved patients clinically diagnosed with chronic achilles tendinosis the primary purpose of this singlecentre phase  randomized  double blind placebocontrolled trial was to assess the safety profile of rct injections as compared to placebo injections the study also measured the potential efficacy and impact injections had on tendon structure and function and the symptoms of achilles tendinosis the study was led by principal investigator dr rob lloydsmith mdcm of the university of british columbia ubc and was conducted at the ubc sports medicine clinic in vancouver bc canada data from such a trial not designed for statistical significance often signals clinically significance which is extremely informative for future product development and clinical trial design the goal of the study was to establish sufficient evidence of safety to allow the company to proceed with wellpowered phase  studies investigating optimal dosing treatment frequency effect duration etc as was expected with injecting ml into the achilles tendon all study participants who received injections less one rctinjected participant reported at least one adverse event related to treatment regardless of treatment administered rct or placebo the adverse events were either soreness at the injection site or the observation of a partial thickness tear in the tendon postinjection most reports of soreness resolved shortly after receiving injections about tendon treatment clinical efficacy measurements visaathe visaa scale aims to evaluate the clinical severity for patients with chronic achilles tendinopathy it is a questionnaire which evaluates symptoms and their effect on physical activity it can be used to compare different populations with chronic achilles tendinopathy and facilitate comparisons between studies it can be used to determine the patients clinical severity the visaa represents a clinically validated reliable and diseasespecific questionnaire to measure the condition of the achilles tendon but it is not a diagnostic tool the final version of the questionnaire was named the victorian institute of sport assessmentachilles questionnaire vasa visual analogue scale vas is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms it is an instrument that measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured for example the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain from the patients perspective this spectrum appears on a continuum in that their pain does not take discrete jumps as a categorization of none mild moderate and severe would suggest it was to capture this idea of an underlying continuum that the vas was devised about dr ross

populations we work with to improve our product manufacturing clinical outcomes and assays critical to regulatory approval and commercialization stated replicel president and ceo r lee buckler this study will examine different cell groups from human hair follicles and look for differences and similarities in gene and protein expression additionally the project will analyze array data from select subjects who participated in replicels phase iiia clinical trial of its rch product in development for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia which completed earlier this year this includes data from patients who had the best clinical hair growth response at six months and a sustained positive response at  months in the study with ubc the gene expression profiles of the cultured cells from these clinical trial subjects who had a strong hair growth response will be compared to the gene expression profile of subjects who had a reduced hair growth response the analysis is anticipated to allow replicel to better identify specific genes with high or low expression in the cultured cells that correspond to strong hair growth promotion about professor youwen zhou md phd dr youwen zhou is a

involve  men and women with thinning hair caused by androgenetic alopecia will be conducted at tokyo medical university hospital and toho university ohasi medical center by drs tsuboi and niiyama clinical endpoints will include measures of safety and efficacy based on hair fibre thickness and densitythe study is being financed by shiseido company and each product being injected will be manufactured by shiseido at their spec cellprocessing and expansion center facility in kobe japan replicel helped shiseido design validate and prepare the spec facility for certification by japans pmda pharmaceuticals and medical device agency shiseidos spec team was also trained by replicel and innovacell in the gmp good manufacturing practice compliant production protocols for rchthe product being tested in the clinical study rch is an autologous cell therapy developed by replicel shiseido has an exclusive marketing license to the product for certain asian countries under a license and codevelopment agreement signed in as part of the agreement between the companies replicels team trained the clinical investigatory team on critical elements of both the patient biopsy procedure and injection of the cellular product into the patients scalp furthermore the injector being used in this study mimics replicels patented firstgeneration injection technologyin the agreement shiseido committed to sharing the clinical data from this study with replicel thus further strengthening the collective data package being created on rch while such data may be sufficient for shiseido to bring rch to market in japan it will also be valuable to replicel to inform further product development and clinical testing decisions for use in submissions to other regulatory agencies andor to support license negotiations for this product to parties for market rights outside of shiseidos exclusive territorysince the signing of the development agreement replicel has been working closely with shiseido on the technology transfer optimizing several features of the products manufacturing and continuing to add to the body of science as it relates to the product and its intended functionwe believe that japans unique regenerative medicine regulatory and industry environment provides a unique opportunity to rapidly advance this product in their country we are excited that rch has the potential to be launched in the japanese market by shiseido sooner than anywhere else in the world stated replicel ceo r lee bucklerabout rchrch is an autologous cell therapy utilizing dermal sheath cup dsc cells isolated from the hair follicle to treat androgenetic alopecia to manufacture rch dermal sheath cup cells are isolated from a small punch biopsy taken from the back of a subjects scalp these cells are replicated in a gmp compliant cell production facility and the cells are then injected into balding areas on the same subjects scalp in clinical trials after injections are performed subjects return to the clinic at regular intervals for assessment of total terminal and vellus hair density and cumulative hair thickness as well as for safety and data collectionsince signing the regional licensing and codevelopment agreement replcel and shiseido have optimized the product and its manufacturing including building validating and obtaining pmda certification of shiseidos facility purposebuilt for this product successfully completed the transfer of the manufacturing protocols and the product manufacturing validations selected the clinical sites trained all related personnel and obtained regulatory clearance for the clinical studymarket  billion was spent on hair loss treatments in  according to the washington post with  billion of this spent on surgical procedures according to the international society of hair restoration surgery we believe rch has the potential to capture a good percentage of that surgical expenditure but also to significantly grow
