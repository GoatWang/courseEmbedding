the study was to test safety and tolerability of jbt in adults with cf who had forced expiratory volume in  second fev percent predicted at least  without regard to their cftr mutation infecting pathogen or baseline treatment secondary objectives were to evaluate changes in proinflammatory and proresolving lipid mediators as a marker of mechanism of action of jbt and to evaluate efficacy with

stable standardofcare medications were dosed with study product at  cf centers in the us and europe and treated with study product daily for a period of  days with a followup period of  days we look

inflammation is an attempt for the body to protect itself as part of a complex biological response of vascular tissue to harmful stimuli such as pathogens damaged cells or irritants just as the immune system can be triggered to elicit inflammation it can also be triggered to resolve or turn off inflammation this off switch for inflammation was discovered relatively recently resulting from the production of antiinflammatory cellular mediators such as resolvins and lipoxins many chronic inflammatory diseases result from an imbalance between the on and off signals resulting in heightened inflammation that is unable to resolve one of the triggers for this process is the cb receptor pathway found in lymphocytes dendritic cells macrophages glial cells and other immune cells upon activation of the cb receptor on immune cells there is a shift in eicosanoid production resulting in a reduction in proinflammatory eicosanoids eg pge and ltb and an increase in specialized proresolving mediator eicosanoids eg pgj and lxa the end result is that inflammation is halted and resolved while the damaged tissue is remodeled and healed latest news jun   •  am edt corbus
