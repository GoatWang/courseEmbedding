issues and fiduciary duties in the context of significant transactions declarationour modus operandi guiding beliefsweve all heard the we invest in teams first and foremost ideology time and time again while we believe thats true at ranch vc we like to take it a step further we look to invest in how people think in their decisionmaking abilities can they roll with the punches will they overcome the existential risk of building a breakthrough business we immensely respect the determination ambition and grit all our founders possess our hope is to nurture those relationships into something which extends beyond the standard investorfounder dynamic we aim to be a voice of objective reason a benchmark of trust and an arbiter of growth for all our entrepreneurs we view the companies we invest in not as clients but partners celebrating together in the spoils of victory while enduring all the trials and tribulations and doing whatever necessary to persevereinvestment strategy our goal for fund i is to invest in strong teams with high intellectual horsepower across many sectors of industry that are looking to make a material impact on the world their breakthrough ideas must coexist within a burgeoning market have sustainable business models as well as technical defensibility we are a generalist fund with a sector agnostic thesis which reduces restrictions on visibility and creates a more opportunistic approach rather than trying to predict the unpredictable we feel its best to amass a portfolio composed of nonconsensus high upper bound impact opportunities that are right on the edge of the riskreward curve all this to help ensure diversification for our investors as well as enable the future with our portfolio companiesour unique advantageas hypercollaborators and entrepreneurs we bring measurable value to the table for our portfolio companies we have a vested interest in seeing our companies succeed and therefore compelled to bring forth novel ideas pooled resources global connections and strategic partnerships to maximize the probability of success our bespoke partnering model offers preeminent value creation for our portfolio companies across many aspects of business we are not looking to run your company or vote on who the next ceo should be nor do we believe in coercion we simply want to lend our unique
