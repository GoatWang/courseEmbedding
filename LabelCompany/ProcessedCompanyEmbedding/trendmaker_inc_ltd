nuts and bolts of interesting topics nuts and bolts press publishes ebooks on topics not found anywhere else the company was established on august   to publish ebooks under the nuts and bolts brand name earlier in  the company’s founder began developing the concept for an ebook publisher that would produce products that would appeal to tablet and smartphone users who were eager to learn more about their hobbies and interests the family of our founder president chief executive officer chief financial officer treasurer and director michael hillerbrand includes numerous published authors and professional educators mr hillerbrand our sole officer believes the increased popularity of ebooks in the united states is due to certain industry and social trends that should continue for at least the next few years the company believes that the principal changes that have contributed to growth in the ebook market are  the emergence of ebook readers tablet computers and smartphones that make reading ebooks more convenient than a traditional print book  the low cost of production and distribution of ebooks and  the continued consumer interest in consuming media electronically rather than in the traditional print format the company conducts its business through its whollyowned operating subsidiary nuts and bolts publishing llc “nabp” which conducts its business worldwide by delivering ebooks through the internet as of march   nabp using the marketing name nuts and bolts press has published two ebooks – one was published in october  and one was published in november  the company has also recently published the first series of online courses on the online publishing platform wwwudemycom the company’s strategy is to publish new titles on a regular basis increasing output each year of operation as the ebook catalog increases in size brand awareness and profit margins are projected to increase titles will be carefully researched based on consumer search engine topic queries and ebook content will be specifically tailored to match high consumer interests formats will be tested to ensure learning effectiveness and positive consumer reception the ebook electronic format will facilitate easy lowcost updates and format changes the ebook creation process starts with market research this research consists of identifying the categories of current “best sellers” published by other companies and identifying topics in market niches that have a high number of google and bing searches but where such searches result in limited competitive advertising for books both of these market research methods are good indicators of potentially profitable ebook titles the next step in developing ebook titles is to rank this list of potential titlestopics by potential profitability the ranking order of titles is dynamic and is revised as new topics are identified periodically the top titles are moved off the potential title list and put on the production list even when a title is published development is ongoing because the ebooks are published electronically they can be easily modified if an existing ebook title is not meeting sales expectations it can be edited combined with other titles or retitled edits can be made to enhance the quality of the titles or to add new material the creation of new titles can range in the time required depending on familiarity the author has with the subject matter and whether the title is derived from a print book in the public domain or is an original work of the author original works on topics unfamiliar to the author take the longest amount of time to produce the shortest time frame from conception to publication would be about four weeks and the longest could be six months to a year or more the company is focused on the titles that have the highest sales potential and the shortest turnaround time to publication   in august  the company published its first digital multimedia “selfhelp” course on how to start a freelancing business the course teaches anyone how to start their own freelancing business using the digital publishing platform wwwudemycom  the course uses  audiovideo lectures totaling  minutes of content to teach enrolled students in addition  worksheets and quizzes are also included the course currently has over  students enrolled from  countries has received  positive reviews from enrolled students while the student enrollment and response has been very positive sales have been negligible according to the udemy terms of service sales revenues are held in reserve for  months to offset any refunds before being distributed to the publisher the company in addition udemy has the right to advertise courses for sale prices well below the sales price set by the publisher and collects a sales commission of  for all sales udemy generates from its promotional efforts also the majority of students registered for the course redeemed “try it free” promotional coupons sales revenues are expected to be earned in the first fiscal quarter of  management is currently conducting tests on the impact of course title and description copy on increasing sales conversions management is carefully evaluating whether publishing additional multimedia courses makes economic sense httpnutsandboltspresscom   tmin current price volume bid ask days range tmin detailed quote dmmmmyyyy tmin
