mellor joined tanner clinic in  his practice focuses on the full spectrum of ent care including allergy testing and treatment head and neck surgery and facial plastic and reconstructive surgery dr mellor was born in laramie wyo and raised in arkansas he moved west to earn his bs from brigham young university he completed his md at the university of arkansas for medical sciences in little rock postgraduate training was made up of a twoyear residency in general surgery at methodist healthcare in memphis tenn followed by a threeyear residency in otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at the university of tennessee health science center also in memphis dr mellor is a former chief of surgery at davis hospital and medical center where he also served as president of the medical staff he is a cofounder of utah medical outreach a charity organization that flies doctors nurses and medical supplies to rural areas of guatemala to provide medical and surgical services dr mellor continues to travel with the nonprofit which has been making twiceyearly visits since  there he treats such conditions as cleft lip and palate hearing loss and ear tumors dr mellor is married and the father of four grown children he is fluent in spanish what patients are saying about dr mellor “we love him our year old shoved something up her nose the afterhours clinic doctor couldn’t remove it dr mellor came in after hours when he had somewhere else to be and quickly and skillfully removed it he was such a blessing to us that day”   — tiffany on facebook sept   “dr mellor is the best he is blessed

person”   — paula on facebook sept   “dr robert mellor is amazing love his patience and his calmness about everything wouldn’t go to anyone else”   —  amanda on facebook march   utahs desertdry air an enemy to healthy sinuses says ent doc if dr robert mellor had his way visitors to utah would be welcomed by a large road sign that said “don’t pick your nose or blow it too hard” utah’s arid air is responsible for many of the problems commonly seen by this tanner clinic ear nose and throat specialist the fact is he says most of us who live in the beehive state have become “nose abusers” “patients will say ‘why do i keep getting nose bleeds’ or ‘why do i feel so stuffy’” he said “well we could cure a lot of it just by treating our noses better” we can show loving kindness to our noses by keeping them from drying out dr mellor said “very rarely” he adds “should people blow their nose without some kind of moisturizing” some problems arise when the dry air — or is it the nose picking — creates a crusty area or scab in our nose inflaming the tissue and blocking air it feels natural to pick up a kleenex and blow it out and we feel great for a few hours “but that scab just builds up again” said dr mellor “so you blow your nose again if you do that enough and you pick your nose and you manipulate your nose you’ll end up with a hole that goes straight through” the septum which is the cartilage and membrane wall that separates our nostrils that chronic ulcer and hole is called a septum perforation and “it’s a worse problem than you started with” he said utah’s dry air is the foe it makes sense that if dry air is the nose’s enemy moisture is its best friend dr mellor recommends no hard noseblows unless you have some kind of moisture on hand “as you moisturize your nose those crusts get thinner” said dr mellor “moisturizing scabs allows them to soften up and fall away allowing them to heal moisture protects the outside of the crusty area so it heals from the bottom out” moisture comes in the form of saline sprays and gels one product comes in an aloe verabased cream plus salt and water make a common and simple saline solution shy away from petroleum jelly he says “there are better things than vaseline” he recommends that patients prone to nosebleeds and stuffy noses use saline spray in the morning and before bed and don’t blow hard he says if you find blood in your tissue he adds “you’re blowing way too hard” surgery is the preferred method of treating a perforated septum an alternative is to place a “button” type patch in the nose “but very few people can tolerate that” he said the outpatient surgery takes about an hour and requires only a short recovery “most people will recover over a weekend and go back to work on monday” he said humidifier a cheap alternative to hawaii humidifiers can help keep the nose and sinuses moisturized if you use them however dr mellor recommends cleaning them periodically to remove unpleasant bacteria he’s not a big fan of wholehouse humidifiers because of the difficulty maintaining them instead he says “people spend most of their time in their bedroom so if you have a humidifier there it will help” or he adds you could move to hawaii “but then you’d start developing mold allergies”   a dive too deep  a dive too deep — dr  robert mellor’s draw to ent  began in the months following  his return home from an lds  mission during a swim at a  byu pool a very deep dive  from the high dive went  wrong he lost hearing as a result of barotrauma the damage that results from unequal pressure

things have been credited with parts armstrong for example has taken propositions and properties to be parts of their conjunctions sets to be parts of sets that include them and geographical regions and events to be parts of regions and events that contain them the justification for bringing all these diverse relations under a single ‘part–whole’ concept is that they share all or most of the formal features articulated in mereology but the concept  has also prompted an ontological thesis that has been expressed in various ways that wholes are ‘no ontological addition’ to their parts  that to list both a whole and its parts is ‘double counting’ and that there is ‘no more’ to a whole than its parts for example that there is no more to a conjunction than the conjuncts that are its parts and whose truth or falsity determines whether it is true or false for brevity i shall express the thesis in the last of these ways as the claim that entities with parts are ‘nothing but’ those parts

  the active nature of the soul in sense perception robert kilwardby and peter olivijuhana toivanen  josé filipe silva    vivarium  detailsthis article discusses the theories of perception of robert kilwardby and peter of john olivi our aim is to show how in challenging certain assumptions of medieval aristotelian theories of perception they drew on augustine and argued for the active nature of the soul in sense perception for both kilwardby and olivi the soul is not passive with respect to perceived objects rather it causes its own cognitive acts with respect to external objects and thus allows the subject to  perceive them we also show that kilwardby and olivi differ substantially regarding where the activity of the soul is directed to and the role of the sensible species in the process and we demonstrate that there are similarities between their ideas of intentionality and the attention of the soul towards the corporeal world shrinkthth century philosophy misc in medieval

robots and reality a reply to robert sparrowrussell blackford    ethics and information technology  detailswe commonly identify something seriously defective in a human life that is lived in ignorance of important but unpalatable truths at the same time some degree of misapprehension of reality may be necessary for individual health and success morally speaking it is unclear just how insistent we should be about seeking the truth robert sparrow has considered such issues in discussing the manufacture and marketing of robot ‘pets’ such as sony’s doglike ‘aibo’ toy and whatever more advanced devices may  supersede it though it is not his only concern sparrow particularly criticizes such robot pets for their illusory appearance of being living things he fears that some individuals will subconsciously buy into the illusion and come to sentimentalize interactions that fail to constitute genuine relationships in replying to sparrow i emphasize that this would be continuous with much of the minor sentimentality that we already indulge in from day to day although a disposition to seek the truth is morally virtuous the virtue concerned must allow for at least some categories of exceptions despite sparrow’s concerns about robot pets and robotics more generally we should be lenient about familiar relatively benign kinds of selfindulgence in forming beliefs about reality sentimentality about robot pets seems to fall within these categories such limited selfindulgence can coexist with ordinary honesty and commitment to truth shrinkrobot ethics in applied ethics direct

skinner’s appropriation of speech act theory for intellectual history has been extremely influential even as the model continues to be important for historians however philosophers now regard the original speech act theory paradigm as dated are there more recent initiatives that might reignite theoretical work in this area this article argues that the inferentialism of robert brandom is one of the most interesting contemporary philosophical projects with historical implications it shows how brandom’s work emerged out of the broad  shift in the philosophy of language from semantics to pragmatics that also informed speech act theory the article then goes on to unpack the rich implications of brandom’s inferentialism for the theory and practice of intellectual history it contends that inferentialism clarifies legitimizes and informs intellectual historical practice and it concludes with a consideration of the challenges faced by inferentialist intellectual history together

 detailsrobert adams’s finite and infinite goods is one of the most important and innovative contributions to theistic ethics in recent memory this article identifies two major flaws at the heart of adams’s theory his notion of intrinsic value and his claim that ‘excellence’ or finite goodness is constituted by resemblance to god i first elucidate adams’s complex frequently misunderstood claims concerning intrinsic value and godlikeness i then contend that adams’s notion of intrinsic value cannot explain what it could mean  for countless finite goods to be intrinsically valuable next i articulate a criticism of his godlikeness thesis altogether unlike those he has previously addressed i show that on adams’s own account of godlikeness a diverse myriad of excellences could not possibly count as resembling god his theory thus fails to account for a whole world of finite goods i defend my two criticisms against objections and briefly sketch a more aristotelian and christian

   citations     théorie mathématique des catégories en biologie et notion d’équivalence naturelle chez robert rosenfranck varenne    revue dhistoire des sciences  detailsthe aim of this paper is to describe and analyze the epistemological justification of a proposal initially made by the biomathematician robert rosen in  in this theoretical proposal rosen suggests using the mathematical concept of « category » and the correlative concept of « natural equivalence » in mathematical modeling applied to living beings our questions are the following according to rosen to what extent does the mathematical notion of category give access to more « natural » formalisms  in the modeling of living beings is the socalled « naturalness » of some kinds of equivalences which the mathematical notion of category makes it possible to generalize and to put at the forefront analogous to the naturalness of living systems rosen appears to answer « yes » and to ground this transfer of the concept of « natural equivalence » in biology on such an analogy but this hypothesis although fertile remains debatable finally this paper makes a brief account of the later evolution of rosen’s arguments about this topic in particular it sheds light on the new role played by the notion of « category » in his more recent objections against computational models that since the ’s are pervading almost every

reasons in the public square a consideration of robert audis and nicholas wolterstorffs religion in the public squarekevin carnahan    philosophia  detailsfor the last several decades philosophers have wrestled with the proper place of religion in liberal societies usually the debates among these philosophers have started with the articulation of various conceptions of liberalism and then proceeded to locate religion in the context of these conceptions in the process however too little attention has been paid to the way religion is conceived drawing on the work of robert audi and nicholas wolterstorff two scholars who are often read as holding opposing  views on these issues i argue that for the purposes of their argument about liberalism both have implicitly accepted a concept of religion that has come under severe attack in recent work on the subject namely they have accepted a concept of religion that identifies religion primarily with belief ritual practice and ecclesial institutions following recent scholarship i suggest that religion is better conceived as a kind of culture to conclude the essay i gesture toward what the beginnings of a revisioned debate

convince empirically oriented scientists and attempts to provide a viable alternative historical‐critical analysis suggests that biblical future expectations were redemptive responses to changing human needs apocalyptic visions were occasioned by heavy suffering in postexilic  times interpreted in realistic terms they have since proved to be untenable the expectation of a new creation without evil suffering and death is not constitutive for the substantive content of the biblical message as such biblical future expectations must be reconceptualized in terms of best contemporary insight and

development of human moralityrauno huttunen    studies in philosophy and education  detailsan individual is in the lowest phase of moral development if he thinks only of his own personal interest and has only his own selfish agenda in his mind as he encounters other humans this lowest phase corresponds well with sixteenth century british moral egoism which reflects the rise of the new economic order adam smith – wanted to defend this new economic order which is based on economic exchange between egoistic individuals nevertheless he surely did not want to support  the moral theory of british egoism his book the wealth of nations suits well into the world view of british moral egoism but in the book the theory of moral sentiments he presents a moral theory which is the total opposite of moral egoism contemporary german intellectuals saw contradiction in adam smith’s moral social philosophy which they called as das adam  smith  problem  smith himself didn’t think that there is any contradiction in a situation where in economic sphere civil society individual act egoistically and in ethical sphere encounter with the imagined other he feels humanity and compassion toward his fellow men hegel was a passionate reader of adam smith and he acknowledged das adam  smith  problem  he set the task of his social philosophy to overcome this paradox he wanted to create a theory of a social totality where economic egoism and feelings of humanity are not in contradiction in the same time hegel wanted to create a theory on bildung process where human spirit develops from moral unfreedom heteronomy to moral freedom and maturity autonomy taking care both aspect of love and reason in certain hegel’s texts notion of recognition plays crucial role that is why modern hegelians ludwig siep axel honneth and robert williams consider the notion of recognition to be elementary in hegel’s threefold theory of developing human spirit from family via civil society to sittliche state  for hegel family is a sphere where people love their “concrete other” and where feeling surpasses reason civil society is a sphere of private contracts and economic exchanges where cold egoistic and calculative reason surpasses feelings in the sphere of state the contradiction between family and civil society  das adam  smith  problem  is solved by “rational feeling” according to hegel state should protect citizens from alienating effect of egoistic reason of civil society and cultivate “familyfeelings” to rational feelings which integrate citizen into “sittliche community” through

filmphilosophy  detailsthis paper asks questions about trauma and its cultural representation specifically traumas representation in the cinema in this respect it compares and contrasts the work of robert bresson in particular his  masterpiece mouchette  with contemporary hollywood film james mangolds  oscarwinning girl interrupted offers an interesting example for cultural comparison in both mouchette and girl interrupted the subject matter includes amongst other traumatic experiences rape childhood abuse and suicide the paper ponders the question of whether such aspects  of trauma can ever be authentically represented on film or whether on the contrary through the deployment of cultural stereotypes cinematic representation tends rather to reproduce the very forms of structural power which are in the first place traumas primary cause bresson emerges from this analysis in a favourable light for whereas mangold stereotypes victims of trauma and represents traumatic experience itself as inevitable and overdetermined bresson always retains for the victim a sense of critical agency by contrasting key scenes from both films the paper suggests that contemporary popular cinema the hollywoodized form working in tandem with institutions of social control such as psychiatry does not subvert but in fact reproduces patterns of structural power this argument has particular

humanities  detailson the publication of robert lowell’s life studies in  some critics were shocked by the poet’s use of seemingly frank autobiographical material in particular the portrayal of his hospitalizations for bipolar disorder during the late fifties and throughout the sixties a rich vein influenced by lowell  developed in american poetry also during this time the nascent science of psychopharmacology competed with and complemented the more established somatic treatments such as psychosurgery shock treatments and psychoanalytical therapies the development  of thorazine was a remarkable breakthrough allowing patients previously thought incurable to leave hospital in  the release of miltown the first ‘minor’ tranquilizer was heralded with a media fanfare promising a new dawn of psychological cureall these two events blurred the boundary between ‘normality’ and madness by making treatment in the community more widely possible and by medicalizing more commonplace distress lowell’s early depictions of madness situate it as emblematic of the cultural malaise of ‘the tranquilized fifties ’ by his final collection day by day  mental illness had lost its symbolic
