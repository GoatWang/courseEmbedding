of investment bank shearson lehman hutton and its parent company american express several days later kravis who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to johnson presented a new bid for  billion  per share financed with an aggressive debt package kkr had the support of significant equity coinvestments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors investors included cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing

guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs favor was little more than an excuse to reject ross johnsons higher payout of  per share johnson received  million from the buyout kkr collected a  million fee in the rjr takeover at  billion of transaction value including assumed debt rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the deal was first surpassed in july  by the  billion buyout of us

performance of the rjr investment and repeated obituaries in the media kkr was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund ie offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals kkr acquired regal cinemas in  only to see the company in bankruptcy by  kkrs activity level would accelerate over the second half of the s making a series of notable investments including spalding holdings corporation and evenflo  newsquest  kindercare learning centers  amphenol corporation

of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a

cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint offer with johnson and shearson lehman but was rebuffed and johnson attempted to stonewall kkrs access to financial information from rjr rival private equity firm forstmann little  co was invited into the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for rjr many of the major banking players

guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

as bootstrap investments beginning in – they targeted familyowned businesses many of which had been founded in the years following world war ii which by the s and s were facing succession issues many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive henry kravis speaking at the world economic forum in  their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren

cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint offer with johnson and shearson lehman but was rebuffed and johnson attempted to stonewall kkrs access to financial information from rjr rival private equity firm forstmann little  co was invited into the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for rjr many of the major banking players

guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

 or the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  or the exchange act which reflect our current views with respect to among other things our operations and financial performance you can identify these forwardlooking statements by the use of words such as outlook believe expect potential continue may should seek approximately predict intend will plan estimate anticipate the negative version of these words other comparable words or other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or factual matters without limiting the foregoing statements regarding the expected acquisitions of kkr financial holdings llc and avoca capital and the associated change in our distribution policy as well as statements regarding the impact of exits of investments on netting holes and future cash carry and distributions may constitute forwardlooking statements that are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified the transactions may not be completed at all or the benefits and anticipated synergies from such transactions are not realized forwardlooking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties accordingly there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements we believe these factors include those described under the section entitled risk factors in this report these factors should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report and in our other periodic filings we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise         in this report the term gaap refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america         in this report references to kkr we us our and our partnership refer to kkr  co lp and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to kkr  co lp becoming listed on the new york stock exchange nyse on july   kkr group holdings lp group holdings consolidated the financial results of kkr management holdings lp and kkr fund holdings lp together the kkr group partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries each kkr group partnership has an identical number of partner interests and when held together one class a partner interest in each of the kkr group partnerships together represents one kkr group partnership unit         references to our managing partner are to kkr management llc which acts as our general partner and unless otherwise indicated references to equity interests in kkrs business or to percentage interests in kkrs business reflect the aggregate equity of the kkr group partnerships and are net of amounts that have been allocated to our principals in respect of the carried interest from kkrs business as part of our carry pool and certain minority interests references to our principals are to our senior employees and nonemployee operating consultants who hold interests in kkrs business through kkr holdings lp which we refer to as kkr holdings and references to our senior principals are to principals who also hold interests in our managing partner entitling them to vote for the election of its directors         prior to october   kkrs business was conducted through multiple entities for which there was no single holding entity but were under common control of senior kkr principals and in which senior principals and kkrs other principals and individuals held ownership interests collectively the predecessor owners on october   we completed the acquisition of all of the assets and liabilities of kkr  co guernsey lp fka kkr private equity investors lp or kpe and in connection with such acquisition completed a series of transactions pursuant to which the business of kkr was reorganized into a holding company structure the reorganization involved a contribution of certain equity interests in kkrs business that were held by kkrs predecessor owners to the kkr group partnerships in exchange for equity interests in the kkr group partnerships held through kkr  table of contents holdings we refer to the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of kpe and to our subsequent reorganization into a holding company structure as the kpe transaction         in this report the term assets under management or aum represents the assets from which kkr is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkrs capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds kkr calculates the amount of aum as of any date as the sum of i the fair value of the investments of kkrs investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds ii the fair value of investments in kkrs coinvestment vehicles iii the net asset value of certain of kkrs credit products iv the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles and v the fair value of other assets managed by kkr kkrs definition of aum is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions         in this report the term fee paying assets under management or fpaum represents only those assets under management from which kkr receives fees we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees this relates to kkrs capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds for only those funds where kkr receives fees ie excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkrs fees and differs from aum in the following respects i assets from which kkr does not receive a fee are excluded ie assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest and ii certain assets primarily in its private equity funds are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments         in this report the term fee related earnings or fre is comprised of segment fees less segment expenses other than certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income this measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of kkr and its business segments before investment income we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses the components of fre on a segment basis differ from the equivalent gaap amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of i the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation ii the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities iii the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets iv the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations v the exclusion of noncash equity charges and other noncash compensation charges borne by kkr holdings or incurred under the kkr  co lp  equity incentive plan vi the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses and vii the exclusion of certain nonrecurring items         in this report the term economic net income loss or eni is a measure of profitability for kkrs reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of kkr and its business segments we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of kkrs businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest eni is comprised of i fre plus ii segment investment income loss which is reduced for carry pool allocations management fee refunds interest expense and certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income less iii certain economic interests in kkrs segments held by third parties eni differs from net income loss on a gaap basis as a result of i the exclusion of the items referred to in fre above ii the exclusion of investment income loss relating to noncontrolling interests and iii the exclusion of income taxes  table of contents         in this report syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by kkr investment funds and carryyielding coinvestment vehicles which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee it does not include i capital invested in such transactions by kkr investment funds and carryyielding coinvestment vehicles which is instead reported in committed dollars invested and ii debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by kkr investment funds syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr and its business segments during a given period and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in kkrs capital markets and principal activities segment and across its investment platform         you should note that our calculations of aum fpaum fre eni syndicated capital and other financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers and as a result our measurements of aum fpaum fre eni syndicated capital and other financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers for

who put their own capital at risk when making private equity investments we seek out strong business franchises attractive growth prospects leading market positions and the ability to generate attractive returns in our private equity funds we do not effect transactions that are hostile meaning a target companys board of directors makes an unfavorable recommendation with respect to the

limited number of other firms we also proactively pursue business development strategies that are designed to generate deals internally based on the depth of our industry knowledge and our reputation as a leading financial sponsor         to enhance our ability to identify and consummate private equity investments we have organized our investment professionals in industryspecific teams our industry teams work closely with our operating consultants and senior advisors to identify businesses that can be grown and improved these teams conduct their own primary research develop a list of industry themes and trends identify companies and assets in need of operational improvement and seek out businesses and assets that they believe will benefit from our involvement they possess a detailed understanding of the economic drivers opportunities for value creation and strategies that can be designed and implemented to improve companies across the industries in which we invest due diligence and the investment decision         when an investment team determines that an investment proposal is worth consideration the proposal is formally presented to the applicable regional investment committee and the due diligence process commences if appropriate the objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational improvement and value creation when conducting due diligence investment teams evaluate a number of important business financial tax accounting environmental social governance legal and regulatory issues in order to determine whether an investment is suitable while the due diligence process differs depending on the type of investment we make generally in connection with the private equity due diligence process investment professionals spend significant amounts of time meeting with a companys management and operating personnel visiting plants and facilities and where appropriate speaking with other stakeholders interested in and impacted by the investment in order to understand the opportunities and risks associated with the proposed investment our investment professionals may also use the services of outside accountants consultants lawyers investment banks and industry experts as  table of contents appropriate to assist them in this process investment committees monitor all due diligence practices and the applicable investment committee must approve an investment before it may be made building successful and competitive businesses         portfolio management committees are responsible for working with our investment professionals from the date on which a private equity investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored when investing in a private equity portfolio company we partner with management teams to execute on our investment thesis and we rigorously track performance through regular monitoring of detailed operational and financial metrics as well as appropriate environmental social and governance issues we have developed a global network of experienced managers and

investments from our inception through december   the firm has generated approximately  billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our private equity portfolio companies in initial public offerings and secondary offerings dividends and sales to strategic buyers when exiting private equity investments our objective is to structure the exit in a manner that optimizes returns for fund investors and in the case of publicly traded companies minimizes the impact that the exit has on the trading price of the companys securities we believe that our ability to successfully realize investments is attributable in part to the strength and discipline of our portfolio management committees and capital markets business as well as the firms longstanding relationships with corporate buyers and members of the investment banking and investing communities private equity fund structures         the private equity funds that we sponsor and manage have finite lives and investment periods each fund is organized as a single partnership or a combination of separate domestic and overseas partnerships and each partnership is controlled by a general partner private equity fund investors are limited partners who agree to contribute a specified amount of capital to the fund from time to time for use in qualifying investments during the investment period which generally lasts up to six years depending on how quickly capital is deployed the investment period for certain funds may be terminated upon supermajority vote based on capital commitment of the funds limited partners or by the funds advisory committee the term of our private equity funds generally end  to  years from the date of the funds first or last investment subject to a limited number of extensions with the consent of the limited partners or the applicable advisory committee given the length of the investment periods and terms of our private equity funds and the limited conditions under which such periods can be terminated and commitments may be withdrawn the aum of our private equity funds provide a longterm stable capital base         each private equity funds general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest that allocates to it  of the net profits realized by the limited partners from the funds investments our newest private equity funds the north america fund xi and our asian fund ii have a performance hurdle which requires that we return  compounded annually to limited partners in the fund prior to receiving our  share of net profits realized by limited partners such performance hurdles are  table of contents subject to a catchup allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached our earlier private equity funds do not include a performance hurdle the timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds and is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund only after all of the following are met i a realization event has occurred eg sale of a portfolio company dividend etc ii the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception in excess of performance hurdles where applicable and iii with respect to investments with a fair value below cost cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments fair value for a fund that has a fair value above cost overall but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a netting hole see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquiditysources of liquidity for a discussion of netting holes net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds except for the annex fund as discussed below under other private equity investment vehiclese investors annex fund in addition the agreements governing kkrs private equity funds generally include a clawback or in certain instances a net loss sharing provision that if triggered may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the life of the fund see

accounting policiesnet loss sharing provision and risk factorsthe clawback or net loss sharing provisions in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors         we enter into management agreements with our private equity funds pursuant to which we receive management fees in exchange for providing the funds with management and other services gross management fees for our private equity funds generally range from  to  of committed capital during the funds investment period and is generally  of invested capital after the expiration of the funds investment period with subsequent reductions over time which causes the fees to be reduced as investments are liquidated these management fees are paid by private equity fund investors who generally contribute capital to the fund in order to allow the fund to pay the fees to us our private equity funds generally require that management fees be returned to fund investors before a carried interest may be paid         we also enter into monitoring agreements with our portfolio companies pursuant to which we receive periodic monitoring fees in exchange for providing them with management consulting and other services and we typically receive transaction fees for providing portfolio companies with financial advisory and other services in connection with specific transactions in some cases we may be entitled to other fees that are paid by an investment target upon closing a transaction or when a potential investment is not consummated our private equity fund agreements typically require us to share  to  of any monitoring transaction and other fees that are allocable to a fund after reduction for expenses incurred allocable to a fund from unconsummated transactions with fund investors         in addition the agreements governing our private equity funds enable investors in those funds to reduce their capital commitments available for further investments on an investorbyinvestor basis in the event certain key persons for example both of messrs kravis and roberts and in the case of certain geographically or product focused funds one or more of the investment professionals focused on such funds cease to be actively involved in the management of the fund while these provisions do not allow investors in our funds to withdraw capital that has been invested or cause a fund to terminate the occurrence of a key man event could cause disruption in our business reduce the amount of capital that we have available for future investments and make it more challenging to raise additional capital in the future  table of contents         to the extent investors in our private equity funds suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct fund investors may have remedies against us our private equity funds our principals or our affiliates under the federal securities laws and state laws while the general partners and investment advisers to our private equity funds including their directors officers other employees and affiliates are generally indemnified by the private equity funds to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our private equity funds such indemnity does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct         because private equity fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the funds manager also invests its own capital in the funds investments our private equity fund documents generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds the amounts of these commitments which are negotiated by fund investors generally range from  to  of a funds total capital commitments at final closing but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies when investments are made the general partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and acquires a capital interest in the investment that is not subject to a carried interest or management fees prior to the kpe transaction these capital contributions were funded with cash from operations that otherwise would be distributed to our principals subsequent to the kpe transaction these general partner commitments are made through our capital markets and principal activities segment other private equity investment vehicles         e investors annex fund     we established the annex fund in  to enable fund investors in the european fund ii and the millennium fund to make additional investments in portfolio companies of the european fund ii which had already been fully invested this fund has several features that distinguish it from our other private equity funds including i it does not pay a management fee to us ii its general partner is only entitled to a carried interest after netting any losses costs and expenses relating to european fund ii and certain millennium fund investments from the profits of the annex fund investments and iii no transaction or incremental monitoring fees are charged in connection with investments in which the annex fund

interests in certain kkr private equity funds coinvestments in certain portfolio companies of such private equity funds and other assets we acquired in the kpe transaction with the remaining holdings

vehicles and public markets separately managed accounts and investment funds with allocations assigned to a type or geographic region according to subscriptions received from a limited partner competition         we compete with other investment managers for both fund investors and investment opportunities the firms competitors consist primarily of sponsors of public and private investment funds real estate development companies business development companies investment banks commercial finance companies and operating companies acting as strategic buyers we believe that competition for fund investors is based primarily on investment performance investor liquidity and willingness to invest investor perception of investment managers drive focus and alignment of interest business reputation duration of relationships quality of services pricing fund terms including fees and the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or are to be made we believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing terms and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution in addition to these traditional competitors within the global investment management industry we also face competition from local and regional firms financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds in the various countries in which we invest in certain emerging markets local firms may have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest these competitors often fall into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may represent new types of fund investors including high net worth individuals family offices and state sponsored entities         there are numerous funds focused on private equity real assets credit and hedge fund strategies that compete for investor capital fund managers have also increasingly adopted investment strategies outside of their traditional focus for example funds focused on credit and equity strategies have become active in taking control positions in companies while private equity funds have acquired minority andor debt positions in publicly listed companies this convergence could heighten competition for investments furthermore as institutional fund investors increasingly consolidate their relationships for multiple investment products with a few investment firms competition for capital from such institutional fund investors may become more acute         some of the entities that we compete with as an investment firm may have greater financial technical marketing and other resources and more personnel than us and in the case of some asset classes longer operating histories more established relationships or greater experience several of our  table of contents competitors also have raised or may raise significant amounts of capital and have investment objectives that are similar to the investment objectives of our funds which may create additional competition for investment opportunities some of these competitors may also have lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us which may create competitive advantages for them for example master limited partnerships or mlps which typically invest in oil and gas assets may have a lower cost of capital than and may compete with our energy funds for investment opportunities in addition some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances different risk assessments or lower return thresholds which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments         we expect to compete as a capital markets business primarily with investment banks and independent brokerdealers in the north america europe asiapacific and the middle east we principally focus our capital markets activities on the firm our portfolio companies and fund investors but we also seek to service other third parties principally through merchant capital solutions llc while we generally target customers with whom we have existing relationships those customers may have similar relationships with the firms competitors many of whom will have access to competing securities transactions greater financial technical or marketing resources or more established reputations than us the limited operating history of our capital markets business could make it difficult for us to compete with established investment banks or brokerdealers participate in capital markets transactions of issuers or successfully grow the firms capital markets business over time         competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees and consultants our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and consultants and retain and motivate our existing employees

filings that we make from time to time with the sec including our consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our business financial condition or results of operations could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial in any such case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your original investment while we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable we can provide no assurance and we make no representation that our mitigation efforts will be successful risks related to our business difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition         our business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world such as interest rates availability of credit inflation rates economic uncertainty changes in laws including laws relating to taxation trade barriers commodity prices currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances including  table of contents wars terrorist acts or security operations for example the unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets during  and  provoked significant volatility of securities prices contraction in the availability of credit and the failure of a number of companies including leading financing institutions and had a material adverse effect on our businesses while the adverse effects of that period have abated to a significant degree there continue to be lingering signs of economic weakness characterized by low levels of growth and high levels of unemployment and governmental deficits in major markets including the united states and europe in addition while volatility has declined in  global financial markets have experienced periods of significant volatility in particular following the downgrade by standard  poors on august   of the longterm credit rating of us treasury debt from aaa to aa furthermore while a number of policy actions have been implemented with respect to debt and banks in a number of european countries europe continues to experience negative growth and ongoing austerity deleveraging in the developed world is continuing and likely to persist in the nearterm in the us while federal lawmakers passed certain interim measures to fund the federal government in october  a failure to reach a longer term budget agreement could lead to another federal government shut down or otherwise adversely impact the financial markets in the spring of  concerns about the federal reserves plan to scale back its monetary stimulus plan later in  caused investors to sell off significant amounts of stocks and bonds resulting in the rapid increase in interest rates in the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve announced a plan to gradually scale down its large scale asset purchase program commonly referred to as quantitative easing this and further changes in monetary policy could impair the economic recovery in the us and lead to increased volatility furthermore while us financial institutions have seen recent improvements global financial institutions have generally not yet provided debt financing in amounts and on terms commensurate with what they provided prior to          such market and economic conditions are outside our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the value of our investments in addition we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions andor events for example as of march   the date of the lowest aggregate valuation of our private equity funds during the most recent downturn the investments in the private equity funds contributed to us in the kpe transaction were marked down to  of original cost and values across all geographies declined for example as of march   the european fund ii european fund iii  fund and asian fund had multiples of invested capital of x x x and x respectively as of december   these same funds are each valued at multiples of invested capital of x x x and x respectively our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in net income relating to changes in market and economic conditions         unfavorable market conditions may reduce opportunities for our funds to make exit and realize value from their investments for example when financing is not available it is difficult for potential buyers to raise sufficient capital to purchase assets in our funds portfolios consequently we may earn lower than expected returns on investments which could cause us to realize diminished or no carried interest in addition we may not be able to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital which could adversely affect our ability to raise new funds because we can generally only raise capital for a successor fund following the substantial and successful deployment of capital from the existing fund in the event of poor performance by existing funds or during periods of unfavorable fundraising conditions pressures by fund investors for lower fees different fee sharing arrangements for transaction or other fees and other concessions for example the inclusion of performance hurdles that require us in our newer funds such as north america fund xi and asian fund ii to generate a specified return on investment prior to our right to receive carried interest will likely continue and could increase the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have managed in the circumstances described above successor funds raised by us are also likely in many instances to be smaller than our comparable  table of contents predecessor funds fund investors may also seek to redeploy capital away from certain of our credit or other nonprivate equity investment vehicles which permit redemptions on relatively short notice in order to meet liquidity needs or invest in other asset classes any of these developments could adversely affect our future revenues net income cash flow financial condition or ability to retain our employees see our inability to raise additional or successor funds could have a material adverse impact on our business and our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues         during periods of difficult market or economic conditions or slowdowns which may be across one or more industries sectors or geographies companies in which we have invested may experience decreased revenues financial losses credit rating downgrades difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations or be unable to meet their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due including amounts payable to us negative financial results in our funds portfolio companies may result in lower investment returns for our investment funds which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flow to the extent the operating performance of such portfolio companies as well as valuation multiples deteriorate or do not improve our funds may sell those assets at values that are less than we projected or even at a loss thereby significantly affecting those funds performance and consequently our operating results and cash flow and resulting in lower or no carried interest being paid to us adverse conditions may also increase the risk of default with respect to private equity credit and other equity investments that we manage or the abandonment or foreclosure of our real asset investments even if economic and market conditions do improve broadly adverse conditions in particular sectors may also cause our performance to suffer finally low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and the supply decreases changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing for their investments or refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained which could lead to loweryielding investments and potentially decrease our net income         in the event that our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case either of which could lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us any failure by lenders to provide previously committed financing can also expose us to potential claims by sellers of businesses which we may have contracted to purchase similarly our portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations to the extent that credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and therefore the investment returns on our funds in addition to the extent that conditions in the credit markets impair the ability of our portfolio companies to refinance or extend maturities on their outstanding debt either on favorable terms or at all the operating performance of those portfolio companies may be negatively impacted which could impair the value of our investment in those portfolio companies and lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us in some cases the inability of our portfolio companies to refinance or extend maturities may result in the inability of those companies to repay debt at maturity and may cause the companies to sell assets undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection which would also likely impair the value of our investment and lead to a decrease in investment income earned by us  table of contents adverse economic and market conditions may adversely affect our liquidity position which could adversely affect our business operations in the future         we expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to  continue to grow our business including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds coinvestments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies  service debt obligations as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments  fund cash operating expenses  pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings  make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy  underwrite commitments within our capital markets business and  acquire additional principal assets including other investment advisory and brokerdealer businesses         these liquidity requirements are significant and in some cases involve capital that will remain invested for extended periods of time as of december   we have approximately  billion of remaining unfunded capital commitments to our investment funds our commitments to our funds will require significant cash outlays over time and there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from realizations of investments to fund them in addition as of december   we had  billion of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and debt securities and  billion of cash and shortterm investments while we have longterm committed financings with substantial facility limits the terms of those facilities will expire in  and  and our senior notes become due in  and  see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and any borrowings thereunder will require refinancing or renewal which could result in higher borrowing costs or issuing equity depending on credit or other market conditions we may not be able to renew all or part of these borrowings or find alternate sources of financing on commercially reasonable terms and we may not be able to raise equity in addition the underwriting commitments for our capital markets business may require significant cash obligations and these commitments may also put pressure on our liquidity the holding company for our capital markets business has entered into a credit agreement that provides for revolving borrowings of up to  million which can be used in connection with our capital markets business including placing and underwriting securities offerings to the extent we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities in firm commitment underwritings or otherwise we may be required to borrow under our credit agreement for our capital markets business to fund such obligations which depending on the size and timing of the obligations may limit our ability to enter into other underwriting arrangements or similar activities service existing debt obligations or otherwise grow our business regulatory capital requirements may also limit the ability of our brokerdealer subsidiaries to participate in underwriting or other transactions or to allocate our capital more efficiently across our businesses in addition in connection with our acquisitions of kkr prisma and a minority interest in nephila we may be obligated to make future deferred purchase price payments based on the respective performance of these businesses in the event that our liquidity requirements were to exceed available liquid assets for the reasons specified above or for any other reason we could be forced to sell assets or seek to raise debt or equity capital on unfavorable terms  table of contents the clawback or net loss sharing provisions in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors         the partnership documents governing our carrypaying funds including funds relating to private equity mezzanine infrastructure energy real estate direct lending and special situations investments generally include a clawback provision that if triggered may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund under a clawback obligation upon the liquidation of a fund the general partner is required to return typically on an aftertax basis previously distributed carry to the extent that due to the diminished performance of later investments the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance thresholds excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the kpe transaction as of december   no carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their december   fair values had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value the clawback obligation would have been  million         certain private equity funds that were contributed to us in the kpe transaction in  also include a net loss sharing provision upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle to fund  of the net losses on investments in these vehicles such losses would be required to be paid by us to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner based on the fair market values as of december   there would have been no net loss sharing obligation if the vehicles were liquidated at zero value the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately  million as of december           prior to the kpe transaction in  certain of our principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally guaranteed on a several basis and subject to a cap the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners clawback obligations the terms of the kpe transaction require that our principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the kpe transaction up to a maximum of  million through investment realizations this amount has been reduced to  million as of december   using valuations as of december   no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by our principals carry distributions arising subsequent to the kpe transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and our principals who participate in the carry pool unlike the clawback obligation we will be responsible for amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify our principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts in addition guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally our earnings and cash flow are highly variable due to the nature of our business and we do not intend to provide earnings guidance each of which may cause the value of interests in our business to be volatile         our earnings are highly variable from quarter to quarter due to the volatility of investment returns of most of our funds and other investment vehicles and our principal assets and the fees earned from our businesses we recognize earnings on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds and for certain of our recent funds  table of contents when a performance hurdle is achieved a decline in realized or unrealized gains a failure to achieve a performance hurdle or an increase in realized or unrealized losses would adversely affect our net income fee income which we recognize when contractually earned can vary due to fluctuations in aum the number of investment transactions made by our funds the number of portfolio companies we manage the fee provisions contained in our funds and other investment products and transactions by our capital markets business fees for the years ended december    and  were  million  million and  million respectively we may create new funds or investment products or vary the terms of our funds or investment products for example our newer funds include performance hurdles which may alter the composition or mix of our income from time to time we may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter including our revenue and net income due to a number of other factors including changes in the values of our funds investments changes in the amount of distributions or interest earned in respect of investments changes in our operating expenses the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions net income loss attributable to kkr  co lp for the years ended december    and  was  million  million and  million respectively such fluctuations may lead to variability in the value of interests in our business and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in future periods it may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the value of interests in our business         the timing and receipt of carried interest from our investment funds are unpredictable and will contribute to the volatility of our cash flows for example with respect to our private equity funds carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met i a realization event has occurred eg sale of a portfolio company dividend etc ii the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception in excess of performance hurdles where applicable and iii with respect to investments with a fair value below cost cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments fair value carried interest payments from investments depend on our funds performance and opportunities for realizing gains which may be limited it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value or other proceeds of an investment through a sale public offering or other exit to the extent an investment is not profitable no carried interest shall be received from our funds with respect to that investment and to the extent such investment remains unprofitable we will only be entitled to a management fee on that investment furthermore certain vehicles and separately managed accounts may not provide for the payment of carry at all even if an investment proves to be profitable it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash we cannot predict when or if any realization of investments will occur in addition if finance providers such as commercial and investment banks make it difficult for potential purchasers to secure financing to purchase companies in our investment funds portfolio it may decrease potential realization events and the potential to earn carried interest a downturn in the equity markets would also make it more difficult to exit investments by selling equity securities if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter the event may have a significant impact on our cash flows during the quarter that may not be replicated in subsequent quarters a decline in realized or unrealized gains or an increase in realized or unrealized losses would adversely affect our investment income which could further increase the volatility of our quarterly results         in addition with respect to certain of the funds that we advise such as hedge funds fund of funds and kfn we are entitled to incentive fees that are generally paid annually semiannually or quarterly if the net asset value of a fund has increased over a certain predetermined hurdle rate or a specified highwater mark these funds but not kfn also have highwater mark provisions whereby if the funds have experienced losses in prior periods we will not be able to earn incentive fees with respect to a fund investors account until the net asset value of the fund investors account exceeds the highest  table of contents period end value on which incentive fees were previously paid the incentive fees we earn are therefore dependent on the net asset value of these funds or vehicles which could lead to volatility in our quarterly results and cash flow fees including incentive fees from kfn will be eliminated upon the completion of the kfn merger on a segment basis         the timing and receipt of carried interest also varies with the life cycle of our funds our carry paying funds that have completed their investment periods and are able to realize mature investments referred to as being in a harvesting period are more likely to make larger distributions than our carrying paying funds that are in their fund raising or investment periods that precede the harvesting period during times when a significant portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry paying funds that are not in their harvesting periods we may receive substantially lower carried interest distributions a decline in the pace or size of investment by our funds or an increase in the amount of transaction fees and management or monitoring fees we share with our fund investors would result in our receiving less revenue from such fees         the transaction and management or monitoring fees that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and the size of those investments any decline in that pace or the size of such investments would reduce our revenue from transaction and management or monitoring fees many factors could cause such a decline in the pace of investment or the transaction and management or monitoring fees we receive including  the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities  competition for such opportunities among other potential acquirers  decreased availability of capital or financing on attractive terms  our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business regulatory or legal complexities and adverse developments in the us or global economy or financial markets  terms we may agree with our fund investors to increase the percentage of transaction or other fees we may share with them and  new regulations or actions of regulatory authorities our inability to raise additional or successor funds or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds could have a material adverse impact on our business         our current private equity funds and certain other funds and investment vehicles have a finite life and a finite amount of commitments from fund investors once a fund nears the end of its investment period our success depends on our ability to raise additional or successor funds in order to keep making investments and over the long term earning management fees although our funds and investment vehicles generally continue to earn management fees at a reduced fee rate after the expiration of their investment periods even if we are successful in raising successor funds to the extent we are unable to raise successor funds of a comparable size to our predecessor funds or the extent that we are delayed in raising such a successor fund our revenues may decrease as the investment period of our predecessor funds expire and associated fees decrease for example kkr north america fund xi our most recent private equity fund focused primarily on north america is smaller than its predecessor fund in addition the management fee for our european fund iii will decrease beginning the second quarter as the fund enters its postinvestment period on march   and we will not have a successor european private equity fund to offset such decrease in fees until such successor fund has its first close and commences its investment period the evolving preferences of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure such as  table of contents managed accounts smaller funds and coinvestment vehicles become a larger part of our business going forward this could increase our cost of raising capital at the scale we have historically achieved furthermore in order to raise capital for new strategies and products without drawing capital away from our existing products we will need to seek new sources of capital institutional investors in funds that have suffered from decreasing returns liquidity pressure increased volatility or difficulty maintaining targeted asset allocations may materially decrease or temporarily suspend making new fund investments such investors may elect to reduce their overall portfolio allocations to alternative investments such as private equity funds resulting in a smaller overall pool of available capital in our industry in addition the asset allocation rules or regulations or investment policies to which such thirdparty investors are subject could inhibit or restrict the ability of thirdparty investors to make investments in our investment funds coupled with a lack of distributions from their existing investment portfolios many of these investors may have been left with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments to and invested capital in a number of investment funds which may significantly limit their ability to make new commitments to thirdparty managed investment funds such as those advised by us         fund investors may also seek to redeploy capital away from certain of our credit vehicles hedge fund fund of funds or other investment vehicles which permit redemptions on relatively short notice in order to meet liquidity needs or invest in other asset classes we believe that our ability to avoid excessive redemption levels primarily depends on our funds continued satisfactory performance although redemptions may also be driven by other factors important to our fund investors including their need for liquidity and compliance with investment mandates even if our performance is superior any such redemptions would decrease our aum and revenues         in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act under what has become known as the volcker rule broadly prohibits depository institution holding companies including foreign banks with us branches or agencies insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates or banking entities from investing in thirdparty private equity funds like ours final regulations implementing the volcker rule were approved by the federal banking agencies the sec and the cftc on december   although there is still uncertainty regarding the implementation of the volcker rule and the final regulations and their practical implications although banking entities will generally have until july   to conform their existing activities and investments to the requirements of the final regulations they may be limited in their ability to undertake new contractual commitments to private equity funds like ours banking entities have historically represented an important class of investors for our funds with financial institutions constituting approximately  of our aum as of december   and it is possible that other institutions will not be available to replace this traditional source of capital for our private equity funds furthermore divestitures by banking entities of interests in private equity funds and hedge funds over the next several years to comply with the volcker rule may lead to lower prices in the secondary market for our fund interests which could have adverse implications for our ability to raise funds from investors who may have considered the availability of secondary market liquidity as a factor in determining whether to invest         the number of funds raising capital varies from year to year and in years where relatively few funds are raising capital the growth of our aum fpaum and associated fees may be significantly lower for example for the year ended december   several large private equity funds namely our north america fund xi and asian fund ii were actively fundraising aum for the year ended december   totaled  billion up from  billion as of december   of which  billion was attributable to new capital raised as these funds have completed fundraising and as the fundraising outlook for our next europe focused fund is uncertain our growth in aum fpaum and associated fees attributable to new capital raised may be significantly lower in addition we had several successful fundraises in  for newer strategies such as real estate partners americas energy income and growth fund and our special situations fund and there is no assurance that fundraises for other new strategies will experience similar success in the future  table of contents our investors in future funds including separately managed accounts may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues         in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with investors the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than the terms of prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors for example such terms could restrict our ability to raise investment funds with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds reduce fee revenues we earn reduce the percentage of profits on thirdparty capital in which we share include a performance hurdle that requires us to generate a specified return on investment prior to our right to receive carried interest or add expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities for example our newest private equity funds including north america fund xi and asian fund ii include a performance hurdle that requires us to generate a  return on investment prior to receiving our share of fund gains furthermore as institutional investors increasingly consolidate their relationships with investment firms and competition becomes more acute we may receive more of these requests to modify the terms in our new funds certain of our newer funds also include more favorable terms for fund investors that commit to early closes for our funds agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us could result in a decrease in our profitability         certain institutional investors have also publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures including management or monitoring fees and transaction and advisory fees we have received and expect to continue to receive requests from a variety of fund investors and groups representing such investors to decrease fees and to modify our carried interest and incentive fee structures which could result in a reduction or delay in the timing of receipt of the fees and carried interest and incentive fees we earn in september of  the institutional limited partners association or ilpa published a set of private equity principles or the principles which were revised in january  the principles were developed in order to encourage discussion between limited partners and general partners regarding private equity fund partnership terms certain of the principles call for enhanced alignment of interests between general partners and limited partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements including proposed guidelines for fees and carried interest structures we provided ilpa our endorsement of the principles representing an indication of our general support for the efforts of ilpa         in addition certain institutional investors including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds have demonstrated an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure such as managed accounts specialized funds and coinvestment vehicles we also have entered into strategic partnerships with individual investors whereby we manage that investors capital across a variety of our products on separately negotiated terms there can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable to us as the traditional investment fund structure and the impact such a trend could have on our results of operations if widely implemented is unclear moreover certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to insource their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients         any agreement to terms less favorable to us could adversely affect our revenues and profitability the investment management business is intensely competitive which could have a material adverse impact on our business         we compete as an investment manager for both fund investors and investment opportunities the investment management business is highly fragmented with our competitors consisting primarily of sponsors of public and private investment funds real estate development companies business  table of contents development companies investment banks commercial finance companies and operating companies acting as strategic buyers of businesses we believe that competition for fund investors is based primarily on  investment performance  investor liquidity and willingness to invest  investor perception of investment managers drive focus and alignment of interest  business reputation  the duration of relationships with fund investors  the quality of services provided to fund investors  pricing  fund terms including fees and  the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or will be made         we believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing terms and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution         a number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks  a number of our competitors in some of our businesses may have greater financial technical marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do and in the case of some asset classes longer operating histories more established relationships or greater experience  fund investors may materially decrease their allocations in new funds due to their experiences following an economic downturn the limited availability of capital regulatory requirements or a desire to consolidate their relationships with investment firms  some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by fund investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do  some of our competitors have agreed to terms on their investment funds or products that may be more favorable to fund investors than our funds or products such as lower management fees greater fee sharing or performance hurdles for carried interest and therefore we may be forced to match or otherwise revise our terms to be less favorable to us than they have been in the past  some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors funds or other available investment products  our competitors have raised or may raise significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar investment objectives and strategies to our funds which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many alternative investment strategies seek to exploit  some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities  some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances different risk assessments or lower return thresholds which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments  some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation or less regulatory scrutiny and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do andor bear less expense to comply with such regulations than we do  table of contents  there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding the formation of new funds including a relatively low cost of entering these businesses and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business including major commercial and investment banks and other financial institutions have resulted in increased competition  some fund investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded is smaller or manages fewer investment products and  other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us         we may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices structures and terms offered by competitors our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment alternatively we may experience decreased investment returns and increased risks of loss if we match investment prices structures and terms offered by competitors moreover as a result if we are forced to compete with other investment firms on the basis of price we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee carried interest or other terms there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the alternative investment management industry will decline without regard to the historical performance of a manager fee or carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds without corresponding decreases in our cost structure would adversely affect our revenues and profitability         in addition if interest rates were to rise or if market conditions for competing investment products become or are favorable and such products begin to offer rates of return superior to those achieved by our funds the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease this competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds either of which would adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flow our structure involves complex provisions of us federal income tax laws for which no clear precedent or authority may be available these structures also are subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis         the us federal income tax treatment of our unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of us federal income tax laws for which no clear precedent or authority may be available you should be aware that the us federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the internal revenue service or irs and the us department of the treasury frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts statutory changes revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations the present us federal income tax treatment of owning our common units may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made for instance changes to the us federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes affect the tax considerations of owning our common units change the character or treatment of portions of our income including for instance the treatment of carried interest as ordinary income rather than capital gain and adversely impact your investment in our common units see the discussion below under the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as the market price of our units could be reduced our organizational documents and agreements give the managing partner broad authority to modify the amended and restated  table of contents partnership agreement from time to time as the managing partner determines to be necessary or appropriate without the consent of the unitholders to address changes in us federal state and local income tax regulations legislation or interpretation in some circumstances such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all unitholders for instance the managing partner could elect at some point to treat us as an association taxable as a corporation for us federal and applicable state income tax purposes if the managing partner were to do this the us federal income tax consequences of owning our common units would be materially different moreover certain assumptions and conventions will be applied in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report income gain deduction loss and credit to unitholders in a manner that reflects such unitholders beneficial ownership of partnership items taking into account variation in ownership interests during each taxable year because of trading activity however those assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements it is possible that the irs will assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the internal revenue code andor treasury regulations and could require that items of income gain deductions loss or credit including interest deductions be adjusted reallocated or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects our unitholders the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as the market price of our units could be reduced         over the past several years a number of legislative and administrative proposals have been introduced and in certain cases have been passed by the us house of representatives that would have in general treated income and gains including gain on sale attributable to an interest in an investment services partnership interest or ispi as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than under current law except to the extent such ispi would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital interest your interest in us our interest in kkr fund holdings lp and the interests that kkr fund holdings lp holds in entities that are entitled to receive carried interest may have been classified as ispis for purposes of this legislation it is unclear when or whether the us congress will pass such legislation or what provisions will be included in any legislation if enacted         the most recent legislative proposals provided that for taxable years beginning ten years after the date of enactment income derived with respect to an ispi that is not a qualified capital interest and that is subject to the rules discussed above would not meet the qualifying income requirements under the publicly traded partnership rules therefore if similar legislation is enacted following such tenyear period we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or be required to hold all such ispis through corporations possibly us corporations if we were taxed as a us corporation or required to hold all ispis through corporations our effective tax rate would increase significantly the federal statutory rate for corporations is currently  in addition we could be subject to increased state and local taxes furthermore you could be subject to tax on our conversion into a corporation or any restructuring required in order for us to hold our ispis through a corporation kkrs principals and other professionals could face additional adverse tax consequences under the legislation which might thereby adversely affect kkrs ability to offer attractive incentive opportunities for key personnel         the obama administration has submitted similar legislation to congress that would tax income and gain now treated as capital gains including gain on disposition of interests attributable to an ispi at rates higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law with an exception for certain qualified capital interests the proposed legislation would also characterize certain income and gain in respect of ispis as nonqualifying income under the publicly traded partnership  table of contents rules after a tenyear transition period from the effective date with an exception for certain qualified capital interests the obama administrations published revenue proposals for  and prior years contained similar proposals         states and other jurisdictions have also considered legislation to increase taxes with respect to carried interest for example new york has periodically considered legislation under which you could be subject to new york state income tax on income in respect of our common units as a result of certain activities of our affiliates in new york although it is unclear when or whether such legislation will be enacted         if the proposed legislation described above or any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as the market price of our units could be reduced additional proposed changes in the us taxation of businesses could adversely affect us         the obama administration has announced other proposals for potential reform to the us federal income tax rules for businesses including reducing the deductibility of interest for corporations reducing the top marginal rate on corporations and subjecting entities like many of our entities currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes to an entitylevel income tax similar to the corporate income tax several proposals for reform if enacted could adversely affect us and could reduce the cash we have available for distributions to unitholders or for other uses by us it is unclear what any actual legislation could provide when it would be proposed or what its prospects for enactment could be         other proposals contemplate the migration of the united states from a worldwide system of taxation pursuant to which us corporations are taxed on their worldwide income to a territorial tax system where us corporations are taxed only on their us source income subject to certain exceptions for income derived in lowtax jurisdictions from the exploitation of intangible assets at a top corporate tax rate that would be  the territorial tax system proposals envisage a revenue neutral result and consequently include revenue raisers to offset the reduction in the tax rate and base which may or may not be detrimental to the value of our common units a variation of this proposal contemplates a similar territorial us tax system but with more expansive us taxation of the foreign profits of some nonus subsidiaries such proposal could have the effect of accelerating andor increasing the us taxes payable with respect to earnings of certain of our and our portfolio companies nonus subsidiaries this proposal would also eliminate the withholding tax exemption on portfolio interest debt obligations for investors residing in nontreaty jurisdictions which could result in additional us withholding taxes imposed on ussource interest attributable to certain of our nonus subsidiaries or nonus investors whether these proposals will be enacted by the government and in what form is unknown as are the ultimate consequences of the proposed legislation we depend on our founders and other key personnel the loss of whose services could have a material adverse effect on our business results and financial condition         we depend on the efforts skills reputations and business contacts of our principals including our founders henry kravis and george roberts and other key personnel the information and deal flow they and others generate during the normal course of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields of expertise and knowledge held by our professionals accordingly our success depends on the continued service of these individuals who are not obligated to remain employed with us the loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our revenues net income and cash flows and could harm our ability to maintain or grow aum in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future  table of contents         our principals and other key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our funds and other members of the business community as a result the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds and members of the business community and result in the reduction of aum or fewer investment opportunities for example if any of our principals were to join or form a competing firm our business results and financial condition could suffer         furthermore the agreements governing our private equity funds and certain nonprivate equity investment funds managed by us provide that in the event certain key persons in these funds for example both of messrs kravis and roberts for our private equity funds and in the case of certain geographically or product focused funds one or more of the executives focused on such funds generally cease to actively manage a fund investors in the fund will be entitled to i in the case of our private equity funds reduce in whole or in part their capital commitments available for further investments and ii in the case of certain of our credit or other nonprivate equity investment funds withdraw all or any portion of their capital accounts in each case on an investorbyinvestor basis which could lead possibly to a liquidation of those funds the occurrence of such an event would likely have a significant negative impact on our revenue net income and cash flow if we cannot retain and motivate our principals and other key personnel and recruit retain and motivate new principals and other key personnel our business results and financial condition could be adversely affected         our most important asset is our people and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our principals and other professionals and to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our principals and other key personnel and to strategically recruit retain and motivate new talented personnel including new principals however we may not be successful in these efforts as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive our ability to recruit retain and motivate our professionals is dependent on our ability to offer highly attractive incentive opportunities if legislation such as the recent carried interest proposals were to be enacted income and gains recognized with respect to carried interest would be treated for us federal income tax purposes as ordinary income rather than as capital gain such legislation would materially increase the amount of taxes that we our principals and other professionals would be required to pay thereby adversely affecting our ability to offer such attractive incentive opportunities see risks related to us taxation in addition there are pending laws and regulations that seek to regulate the compensation of certain of our employees see extensive regulation of our business affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could result in additional burdens on our business the loss of even a small number of our investment professionals could jeopardize the performance of our funds and other investment products which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations efforts to retain or attract investment professionals may result in significant additional expenses which could adversely affect our profitability         many of our principals hold interests in our business through kkr holdings these individuals currently receive financial benefits from our business in the form of distributions and amounts funded by kkr holdings and through their direct and indirect participation in the value of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings while all of our employees and our principals receive base salaries from us profitbased cash bonuses for certain principals currently are borne by kkr holdings from cash reserves based upon distributions on a portion of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings in  the amount of such profitbased cash bonuses paid by kkr holdings lp was  million there can be no assurance that kkr holdings will have sufficient cash available to continue to make profitbased cash payments and we expect to pay a portion or eventually all of these cash bonus payments as kkr holdings becomes unable to reserve cash for bonus compensation as our principals who hold equity interests through kkr holdings become entitled to the cash distributions on the kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings  table of contents         moreover in connection with the kpe transaction we made large grants of kkr holdings units that vest in installments over a five year period commencing october   and will completely vest subject to certain transfer restrictions on october   our principals may also receive additional equity interests in our business through equity awards granted by kkr holdings which does not cause any dilution however we have granted and will grant some or all of the types of equity awards historically granted by kkr holdings from our equity incentive plan which has caused dilution in addition we may be unwilling to grant our employees additional significant equity awards in our business whether before or even after all of the kkr holdings units granted in october  vest in october  and the value of the grants and distributions they receive in respect of their existing awards may be lower than anticipated this may limit our ability to attract retain and motivate talented personnel in order to recruit and retain existing and future investment professionals we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them which may cause a higher percentage of our revenue to be paid out in the form of compensation which would have an adverse impact on our profit margins         in addition there is no guarantee that the confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements to which our principals are subject together with our other arrangements with them will prevent them from leaving us joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us or that these agreements will be enforceable in all cases these agreements will expire after a certain period of time at which point each of our principals would be free to compete against us and solicit investors in our funds clients and employees depending on which entity is a party to these agreements andor the laws applicable to them we may not be able to enforce them or become subject to lawsuits or other claims and certain of these agreements might be waived modified or amended at any time without our consent see certain relationships and related transactions and director independenceconfidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements         we strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration motivation and alignment of interests with fund investors if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired which could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations operational risks may disrupt our businesses result in losses or limit our growth         we rely heavily on our financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to our funds regulatory intervention or reputational damage in addition we operate in businesses that are highly dependent on information systems and technology our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth may be subject to security risks and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from our current level such a failure to accommodate growth or an increase in costs related to such information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we depend on our principal offices in new york city where most of our administrative personnel are located for the continued operation of our business a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business or directly affecting our principal offices could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption in addition insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses if at all         our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although we take protective measures and  table of contents endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access theft misuse computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact if one or more of such events occur this potentially could jeopardize our or our fund investors or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our our fund investors our counterparties or third parties operations which could result in significant losses increased costs or reputational damage finally we rely on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business including for certain information systems technology administration tax and compliance matters any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties could impair the quality of our and our funds operations and could impact our reputation and adversely affect our businesses and limit our ability to grow         our portfolio companies also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing storage and transmission of information including payment and health information a disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses and we may expand into new investment strategies geographic markets and businesses each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses         we intend to the extent that market conditions warrant to seek to grow our businesses by increasing aum in existing businesses pursuing new investment strategies including investment opportunities in new asset classes developing new types of investment structures and products such as managed accounts and structured products and expanding into new geographic markets and businesses we have in recent years opened offices in asia the middle east and south america and also developed a capital markets business in the united states europe the middle east and asiapacific which we intend to grow and diversify we have also launched a number of new investment initiatives in areas such as real estate energy infrastructure and hedge funds we have and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies acquisitions of critical business partners strategic partnerships or other strategic initiatives which may include entering into new lines of business for example recently we have formed merchant capital solutions llc a joint venture partnership that seeks to provide capital markets services to midmarket and sponsorbacked companies and maritime finance company a new specialty finance company created to lend to the maritime industry in addition we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional investment managers for example we have built and expanded our hedge fund solutions business with the acquisition of prisma and expanded our european credit business with our acquisition of avoca to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business we will face numerous risks and uncertainties including risks associated with  the required investment of capital and other resources  the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk or liability or have not appropriated planned for such activities  the possibility of diversion of managements attention from our core business  the possibility of disruption of our ongoing business  combining integrating or developing operational and management systems and controls  potential increase in concentration of the investors in our funds  table of contents  disagreements with joint venture partners or other stakeholders in strategic partnerships and  the broadening of our geographic footprint including the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions including taxation         entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar or from which we are currently exempt and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk if a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations our results of operations will be adversely affected our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon and subject to liability losses or reputational damage relating to systems controls and personnel that are not under our control we may not be successful in executing upon or managing the complexities of new investment strategies markets and businesses which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition         our growth strategy is based in part on the expansion of our platform through selective investment in and development or acquisition of businesses and investment strategies complementary to our business the expansion into new products and geographies has demanded greater management attention and dedication of resources to manage the increasing complexity of operations and regulatory compliance this growth strategy involves a number of risks including the risk that the expected synergies from a newly developed product or strategic alliance will not be realized that the expected results will not be achieved that new strategies are not appropriately planned for or integrated into the firm that the new strategies may conflict detract from or compete against our existing businesses that the investment process controls and procedures that we have developed around our existing platform will prove insufficient or inadequate or that our information systems and technology including related security systems may prove to be inadequate we have also entered into strategic partnerships and separately managed accounts which lack the scale of our traditional funds and are more costly to administer the prevalence of these accounts may also present conflicts and introduce complexity in the deployment of capital the offering of investment products to retail investors including our funds registered under the investment company act may result in increased compliance and litigation costs we may also incur significant charges in connection with such investments which ultimately may result in significant losses and costs such losses could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition as well as do harm to our professional reputation our proposed merger with kfn is subject to uncertainty and our acquisitions including our proposed acquisition of kfn expose us to increased risks and liabilities         from time to time we or our affiliates acquire or agree to acquire other businesses or invest in other businesses these acquisitions include our proposed merger with kfn the completion of these acquisitions is subject to various conditions and may expose us to increased risks and liabilities such as  we may be unable to obtain the regulatory clearances required to complete the acquisitions or in order to do so we may be required to comply with material restrictions or satisfy material conditions if we must take such actions it could be detrimental to us or to the combined organization following the consummation of the relevant acquisition furthermore these actions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the relevant acquisition or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined organization following the consummation of the relevant acquisitions  we incur substantial transactionrelated costs in connection with our acquisitions including nonrecurring transactionrelated costs nonrecurring transaction costs include but are not  table of contents limited to fees paid to legal financial and accounting advisors filing fees and printing costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses  failure to successfully combine the acquired businesses in the expected timeframe may adversely affect the future results of the combined organization and consequently the value of our common units the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses and the acquired business on a timely basis failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could result in declines in the market value of kkr common units  failure to complete an acquisition or significant delays in completing an acquisition could negatively affect the trading prices of our common units and our future business and financial results completion of an acquisition is not assured and is subject to risks including the risks that approval by the shareholders or by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied if an acquisition is not completed we may also be liable for damages or have to pay certain significant costs relating to the acquisition and the attention of our management will have been diverted to the acquisition rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us  purported class action complaints may be and in the case of the proposed kfn merger have been filed challenging the acquisition and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of an acquisition and result in substantial costs in the case of the proposed kfn merger multiple class action lawsuits are currently pending that challenge the merger each lawsuit names as defendants some or all of the parties to the merger and the individual members of kfns board of directors among other remedies the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the proposed merger if these lawsuits are not dismissed or otherwise resolved they could prevent andor delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors additional lawsuits may be filed in connection with the proposed merger there can be no assurance that any of the defendants will prevail in the pending litigation or in any future litigation the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect the combined organizations business financial condition or results of operations  acquisitions if consummated subject us to additional risks related to the acquired entitys business and operations for example following the kfn merger if completed we will be subject to the risk that the conduct of kfns operations may render it an investment company and we would be required to sell assets change the manner of its operations or register kfn as an investment company if kfn were to be deemed to be an investment company maintaining kfns investment company status might also make it more difficult for kkr to comply with its own exemption from investment company status under the investment company act see if kfn were deemed to be an investment company subject to regulation under the investment company act applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business upon completion of the merger we will also have increased exposure to the clo and leveraged finance markets see dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments upon the completion of the merger it is expected that kfn would be consolidated and as a result the management and incentive fees we earn from kfn would be eliminated on a segment basis in addition in enlarging our balance sheet we are pursuing a different business strategy than our competitors which generally have smaller balance sheets than we do to the extent we are unsuccessful in developing this strategy our business and financial results may suffer  table of contents if we are unable to syndicate the securities or indebtedness or realize returns on investments financed with our principal assets our liquidity business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected         our principal assets provide us with a significant source of capital to grow and expand our business increase our participation in our transactions and underwrite commitments in our capital markets business our principal assets have provided a source of capital to underwrite loans securities or other financial instruments which we generally expect to syndicate to third parties to the extent that we are unable to do so we may be required to sell such investments at a significant loss or hold them indefinitely if we are required to retain investments on our balance sheet for an extended period of time the inability of our capital markets business to complete additional transactions would impair our results in addition as our principal assets have been a significant source of financing for new strategies to the extent that such strategies are not successful or our principal assets cease to provide adequate liquidity we would be limited in our ability to seed new businesses or support our existing business as effectively as contemplated extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business         our business is subject to extensive regulation we are subject to regulation including periodic examinations by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and foreign government agencies and selfregulatory organizations are empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including censure the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or expulsion of applicable licenses and memberships even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount the adverse publicity relating to the investigation proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients and fund investors or fail to gain new clients and fund investors         as a result of market disruptions in the past years as well as highly publicized financial scandals regulators and fund investors exhibited concerns over the integrity of the us and global financial markets in response regulators in the united states and elsewhere launched programs of regulatory reform that have broad implications for us and for our funds as well as for many of the markets in which we and they operate in addition the private equity industry has come under increased political regulatory and news media scrutiny with politicians governmental officials and regulators focusing on the taxation of carried interest and the private equity industrys allocation of expenses to the funds and valuation practices any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business including the changes and potential changes described below as well as adverse news media attention may impose additional expenses or capital requirements on us limit our fundraising for our investment products result in limitations in the manner in which our business is conducted have an adverse impact upon our financial condition results of operations or prospects impair executive retention or recruitment and require substantial attention by senior management it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or may become law on our business or the markets in which we operate if enacted any new regulation or regulatory framework could negatively impact our funds and us in a number of ways including increasing our costs and the cost for our funds of investing borrowing or hedging increasing the funds or our regulatory costs imposing additional burdens on the funds or our staff and potentially requiring the disclosure of sensitive information in addition we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult or more expensive affect  table of contents the manner in which we conduct business and divert significant management and operational resources and attention from our business moreover we anticipate the potential for an increase in regulatory investigations and new or enhanced reporting requirements of the trading and other investment activities of alternative investment management funds and firms including our funds and us such investigations and reporting obligations will likely impose additional expenses on us may require the attention of senior management and increase the complexity of managing our business and may result in fines if we or any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations         there have been a number of legislative or regulatory proposals affecting the financial sector in the united states in particular the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act that president obama signed into law on july   creates a significant amount of new regulation the doddfrank act  establishes the financial stability oversight council or fsoc a federal agency charged with among other things designating systemically important nonbank financial companies for heightened prudential supervision and making recommendations regarding the imposition of enhanced regulatory standards regarding capital leverage conflicts and other requirements for financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to the financial stability of the us economy  requires private equity and hedge fund advisers to register with the sec under the investment advisers act as described elsewhere in this report kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp and its whollyowned subsidiaries kkr asset management llc and prisma capital partners lp are registered with the sec as investment advisers under the investment advisers act to maintain extensive records and to file reports if deemed necessary for purposes of systemic risk assessment by certain governmental bodies  authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and in certain cases prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions  requires public companies to adopt and disclose policies requiring in the event the company is required to issue an accounting restatement the clawback of related incentive compensation from current and former executive officers  restricts the ability of banking organizations to sponsor or invest in private equity and hedge funds  grants the us government resolution authority to liquidate or take emergency measures with regard to troubled financial institutions that fall outside the existing resolution authority of the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic and  creates a consumer financial protection bureau within the us federal reserve         many of these provisions are subject to further rule making and to the discretion of regulatory bodies such as the fsoc for example the following rulemaking has been enacted and the following notices of proposed rulemakings have recently been announced that may apply to us or our subsidiaries  on april   the fsoc issued a final rule and interpretive guidance regarding the process by which it will designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important the rule and guidance detail a threestage review process with the level of scrutiny increasing at each stage during the first stage the fsoc will apply a broad set of uniform quantitative metrics to identify nonbank financial companies that warrant additional review in this first stage the fsoc considers whether a nonbank financial company has at least  billion in total consolidated assets and whether it meets other thresholds relating to credit default swaps outstanding derivative liabilities loans and bonds outstanding a minimum leverage ratio of total  table of contents consolidated assets to total equity of  to  and a shortterm debt ratio of debt with maturities less than  months to total consolidated assets of  a company that meets both the asset test and at least one of the other thresholds will be subject to additional review in stage  although we have more than  billion in total consolidated assets as of december   and we believe we should not currently meet the stage  criteria outlined above those criteria as well as our business may evolve over time additional uncertainty is created because the fsoc retains authority to designate any nonbank financial company as systemically important even if the company does not meet the stage  criteria the fsoc will consider in the future whether to establish an additional set of metrics or thresholds tailored to evaluate hedge funds and private equity firms and their advisers the preamble to the final rule notes that less regulatory data is generally available for hedge funds and private equity firms but indicates that in developing any such additional metrics or thresholds it intends to review financial disclosures that private fund advisers are required to file with the sec and cftc as further described below if the fsoc were to determine that we were a systemically important nonbank financial company we would be subject to a heightened degree of regulation including more stringent standards relating to capital leverage liquidity risk management resolution planning and credit exposure reporting and concentration limits restrictions on acquisitions and annual stress testing by the federal reserve there can be no assurance that nonbank financial firms such as us will not become subject to the aforementioned restrictions or other requirements for financial firms deemed to be systemically important to the financial stability of the us economy  the doddfrank act under what has become known as the volcker rule broadly prohibits depository institution holding companies including foreign banks with us branches or agencies insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates  or banking entities from investing in thirdparty private equity funds like ours see our inability to raise additional or successor funds or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds could have a material adverse impact on our business  on october   the sec adopted a new rule requiring certain advisers to private funds to periodically file reports on a new form pf large private fund advisers including advisers with at least  billion in assets under management attributable to hedge funds and advisers with at least  billion in assets under management attributable to private equity funds are subject to more detailed and in certain cases more frequent reporting requirements the information will be used by the fsoc in monitoring risks to the us financial system  on march   the sec proposed a rule as part of a joint rulemaking effort with federal banking regulators designed to prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses the proposed rule would cover financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least  billion including investment advisers and brokerdealers and provide heightened requirements for financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least  billion the application of this rule to us could require us to substantially revise our compensation strategy and affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees  the doddfrank act amends the exchange act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the sec and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between  and  of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower  table of contents         as mandated by the doddfrank act the commodity futures trading commission or cftc has proposed or adopted a series of rules to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for swaps and security based swaps for example in october  the cftc passed rules instituting position limits on certain physical commodity futures contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent absent an applicable exemption the regulations would have required aggregation of positions in accounts in which any person directly or indirectly holds an ownership interest of  or more as well as accounts over which that person controls trading in september  the us district court for the district of columbia struck down these rules but the cftc has issued new rules regarding position limits that are substantially similar to the october  rules the timing of the adoption and the content of the final rules remain unclear if the proposed rules are adopted in substantially the form proposed and to the extent that we do not qualify for an exemption we may be required to aggregate the positions of our various investment funds and the positions of our portfolio companies although the scope of the new regulatory framework is still unclear these and other new rules may require us and our portfolio companies to limit our trading activities and in addition our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions in particular industries or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case         the doddfrank act also imposes regulatory requirements on the trading of swaps including requirements that most swaps be executed on an exchange or swap execution facility and cleared through a central clearing house although these requirements presently apply only to certain classes of interest rate swaps and credit default swaps the cftc is expected to mandate central execution and clearing with respect to additional classes of swaps in the future in addition entities acting as dealers or major swap participants must register in the appropriate category and comply with capital margin record keeping reporting and business conduct rules and that overthecounter derivative transactions be reported to central swaps data repositories the imposition of these requirements could increase the cost of trading in the derivative markets which could in turn make it more expensive and difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business among other things margin requirements for swaps and other derivatives are expected to be greater than was previously the case in the overthecounter market moreover these increased regulatory responsibilities and increased costs could reduce trading levels in the derivative markets by a number of market participants which could in turn adversely impact liquidity in the markets and expose our funds to greater risks and reduce hedging opportunities in connection with their trading activities         in february  the cftc issued a final rule that rescinded an exemption from cftc registration for commodity pool operators in connection with privately offered funds narrowed an exception from commodity pool operator registration obligations with respect to registered investment companies and amended related rules and guidance the cftc and its staff have subsequently issued interpretive guidance and noaction letters regarding these exceptions and exclusions and are expected to issue further guidance including guidance regarding the registration obligations of operators of fundsoffunds in addition under title vii of the doddfrank act the cftc has assumed regulatory authority over many types of swaps as a result operating pooled funds or providing investment advice to clients that trade these swaps is now a basis for registration with the cftc absent an applicable exemption monitoring and analysis of whether these new rules would require us or one or more of our affiliates to register with the cftc as commodity pool operators andor commodity trading advisors requires management and operational resources and attention furthermore operating our funds in a manner consistent with one or more exemptions from registration with the cftc may limit the activities of certain of our funds including our funds of funds registration with the cftc if required could impact our operations and add additional costs associated with ongoing compliance  table of contents         in august  the regulation on otc derivatives central counterparties and trade repositories also known as the european market infrastructure regulation or emir became effective certain of the requirements of emir came into force in march  and other obligations will be phased in emir imposes a requirement that certain standardized otc derivatives contracts are centrally cleared where otc transactions are not subject to central clearing techniques must be employed to monitor measure and mitigate the operational and counterparty risks presented by the transaction these risk mitigation techniques include trade confirmation reconciliation processes exchange of margin and the daily marktomarket of trades emir also requires certain filings by market participants regarding otc derivatives trades with central trade repositories certain of these risk mitigation obligations came into force on september   further market participants will be required to report any european derivative contract to a central trade repository         on july   the european securities and markets authority esma published a final report setting out certain regulatory technical standards on contracts with a direct substantial and foreseeable effect within the eu and nonevasion these technical standards set out the circumstances in which emirs provisions on central clearing and risk mitigation techniques will apply to otc derivatives by two noneu counterparties the imposition of these requirements could increase the cost of trading in the derivative markets which could in turn make it more expensive and difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business moreover these increased regulatory responsibilities and increased costs could reduce trading levels in the derivative markets by a number of market participants which could in turn adversely impact liquidity in the markets and expose our funds to greater risks in connection with their trading activities         on september   esma also published its advice to the european commission on the equivalence of emir with a number of thirdcountry regimes based on this advice the european commission may make determinations that compliance with such thirdcountry regimes will be deemed equivalent to compliance with emir on a recognition or substituted compliance basis conditional equivalence was proposed in relation to certain parts of the cftc and sec regimes whereby adherence to the relevant us regimes as well as a number of additional stipulations would deemed equivalent to emir ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding the interaction between us and eu requirements for central clearing and related activities could result in duplicative regulatory obligations in the two jurisdictions and could increase our costs of compliance         the eu alternative investment fund managers directive aifmd entered into effect on july   aifmd establishes a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for alternative investment fund managers aifms managing andor marketing alternative investment funds aifs in the eu the aifmd imposes various substantive requirements to authorized aifms including rules on the structure of remuneration for certain personnel a threshold for regulatory capital reporting obligations in respect of controlled eu portfolio companies and increased transparency towards investors and regulators and allows authorized aifms to market aifs to professional investors throughout the eu under an eu passport available since july  to authorized eu aifms the eu passport is expected to be available to authorized noneu aifms from late  in the meantime and until at least  noneu aifms may continue to market within the eu under the private placement regimes of the individual member states subject to complying with certain minimum requirements imposed by the aifmd and any additional requirements that individual member states may impose the aifmd will also impose a new strict depositary regime affecting how prime brokers may provide custody services to fund managers         although many member states have now implemented the aifmd a number of member states did not meet the implementation deadline of july   once authorized as an aifm the passport system should be available even where the host member has not transposed the aifmd into national law aifms in member states that have not yet implemented the aifmd cannot rely on the marketing passport in other member states  table of contents         the aifmd the level  regulation and eu member state implementing measures could have an adverse effect on our businesses by among other things i imposing disclosure obligations and restrictions on distributions by eu portfolio companies of the funds we manage ii significantly restricting marketing activities in the eu iii potentially requiring changes in our compensation structures for key personnel thereby potentially affecting our ability to recruit and retain these personnel iv potentially in effect restricting our funds investments in companies based in eu countries v require us to restructure our operations and vi generally increasing our compliance costs the aifmd the level  regulation and the eu member state implementing measures could limit both in absolute terms and in comparison to eubased investment managers and funds our operating flexibility our ability to market our funds and our fund raising and investment opportunities as well as expose us to conflicting regulatory requirements in the united states and the eu         in october  the european commission published its proposed revisions to the existing markets in financial instruments directive known as mifid i consisting of the revised directive mifid ii and a new related regulation mifir the proposed revisions are intended to further strengthen the eu regulatory framework for the provision of investment services and trading in financial instruments a number of substantial reforms are proposed on transaction reporting market structure securities trading and conduct of business rules including new regulatory equivalence requirements for third country firms in order for those firms to provide certain investment services in the eu the mifid iimifir proposals are expected to be finalized and agreed by eu legislators by the first quarter of  and to enter into effect in late  at the earliest it is currently expected that the majority of the provisions of mifid ii will come into force in member states during  these regulations of investment firms is expected to increase the regulatory and operating costs of our affected businesses particularly with regards to reporting requirements         during the course of  the eu has proposed or adopted a series of regulatory initiatives that may impact certain aspects of our business in eu member states in march  a regulation that limits sovereign and naked short selling of government bonds and stocks the short selling regulation became effective the short selling regulation took effect on november   in june  the european commission published a legislative proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms if and when adopted the directive will impose new obligations on covered institutions including preparation of recovery and resolution plans and give regulators wideranging powers revisions to the markets in financial instruments directive that were proposed in october  are likely to be adopted in  and are expected to result in new regulatory burdens including a requirement to trade certain derivatives on regulated trading venues in addition having an euregulated brokerdealer may bring other parts of our business namely our investments in noneu insurance brokers within the scope of the eus financial conglomerates directive if we were to become subject to these regulations our business would become subject to capital adequacy requirements additional reporting and disclosure requirements a possible request by eu regulators to establish an eu based intermediate holding company controlling the eu based regulated entities and possible stress testing if requested by eu regulator the imposition of these requirements could increase our and our funds costs and the complexity of managing our business and may result in fines if we or any of our funds are deemed to have violated any of the new regulations         on january   an amendment to the capital requirements directive crd iii entered into force among other things crd iii requires eu member states to introduce stricter controls on remuneration for key employees and risk takers within specified credit institutions and investment firms the committee of european banking supervisors or cebs published guidelines on the implementation of crd iii in december  also in december  the uk financial services authority or fsa amended its remuneration code to reflect crd iii one of our subsidiaries established in the uk is subject to crd iii crd iii required changes in our compensation structures  table of contents for key personnel of this subsidiary thereby potentially affecting its ability to recruit and retain these personnel         in  the basel committee on banking supervision an international body comprised of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from  countries including the united states finalized a comprehensive set of capital and liquidity standards commonly referred to as basel iii for internationally active banking organizations these new standards which are expected to be fully phased in by  are expected to require banks to hold more capital predominantly in the form of common equity than under the current capital framework in july  the european commission published legislative proposals to implement basel iiis capital and liquidity standards by revising the existing capital requirements directive and issuing a new capital requirements regulation collectively referred to as crd iv which came into force on january   crd iv replaces the current crd directive with new measures implementing the basel iii requirements as well as creating a single harmonized prudential rule book for banks introducing new corporate governance and a limited number of additional remuneration requirements including an expected cap on variable remuneration and enhancing the powers of regulators in june  the us federal banking agencies issued proposed regulations that among other things would implement the basel iii capital framework in the united states compliance with the basel iii standards may result in significant costs to banks which in turn may result in higher borrowing costs for the private sector and reduced access to certain types of credit basel iii may increase the cost of borrowing by our funds and portfolio companies which may result in fewer investments being acquired or disposed lower returns a decrease in valuations of our investments or an inability to refinance debt on economic terms see changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our private equity funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing for their investments and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained which could lead to lower yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income         in october  and november  the financial stability board or fsb issued reports that recommended strengthening the oversight and regulation of the socalled shadow banking system broadly described as credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system the report outlined initial steps to define the scope of the shadow banking system and proposed general governing principles for a monitoring and regulatory framework the fsb published final recommendations for the regulation and oversight of shadow banking in august  building on the work of the fsb a money market funds mmf regulation has been proposed by the european commission to address such concerns the key provisions of the proposed mmf regulation include prescribed levels of daily and weekly liquidity a capital buffer of  for constant net asset value funds internal risk credit risk assessment to be carried out by the mmf manager to avoid reliance on external creditratings and clear labels to distinguish between standard and shortterm mmfs with residual maturity not exceeding  days while the mmf regulation has not yet been finalized based on the current proposals it is likely to extend the regulatory and supervisory requirements such that the regulatory and operating costs of our affected businesses would increase and may become prohibitive         we regularly rely on exemptions in the united states from various requirements of the securities act the exchange act the investment company act the commodity exchange act and the us employee retirement income security act of  or erisa in conducting our investment management activities these exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control if for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us we could become subject to additional restrictive and costly registration requirements regulatory action or third party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected for example in raising new funds we typically rely on private placement exemptions from registration under the securities act including regulation d which was  table of contents recently amended to prohibit issuers including our funds from relying on certain of the exemptions from registration if the fund or any of its covered persons including certain officers and directors but also including certain third parties including among others promoters placement agents and beneficial owners of  of outstanding voting securities of the fund has been the subject of a disqualifying event or a bad actor which can include a variety of criminal regulatory and civil matters if any of the covered persons associated with our funds is subject to a disqualifying event one or more of our funds could lose the ability to raise capital in a rule  private offering for a significant period of time which could significantly impair our ability to raise new funds and therefore could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if certain of our employees or any potential significant investor has been the subject of a disqualifying event we could be required to reassign or terminate such an employee or we could be required to refuse the investment of such an investor which could impair our relationships with investors harm our reputation or make it more difficult to raise new funds see also risks related to our organizational structureif we were deemed to be an investment company subject to regulation under the investment company act applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business         on the other hand we are and will become further subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform to include retail investors for example funds in our public markets segment are registered under the investment company act as management investment companies these funds and kkr asset management llc which serves as their investment adviser or in the case of the business development company as its subadviser are subject to the investment company act and the rules thereunder which among other things regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions as our business expands we may be required to make additional registrations including in jurisdictions outside the us compliance with these rules will increase our compliance costs and create potential for additional liabilities and penalties the management of which would divert managements attention from our business and investments         other requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to protect holders of interests in our business consequently these regulations often serve to limit our activities for example federal bank regulatory agencies have issued leveraged lending guidance covering transactions characterized by a degree of financial leverage to the extent that such guidance limits the amount or cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions the returns on our investments may suffer in addition the regulatory environment in which our funds or their investors operate may affect our business for example changes in antitrust laws or the enforcement of antitrust laws could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity and changes in state or other local laws may limit investment activities of state pension plans or insurance companies we may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec or other governmental regulatory authorities including foreign regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets         we are also subject to a number of laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to political persons or other third parties including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa as well as trade sanctions and other export control laws administered by the office of foreign assets control or ofac the us department of commerce and the us department of state the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign governments and their officials and political parties and requires public companies in the united states to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies transactions ofac the us department of commerce and the us department of state administer and enforce various export control laws and regulations including  table of contents economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals these laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business including servicing existing fund investors finding new fund investors and sourcing new investments as well as activities by the portfolio companies in our investment portfolio or other controlled investments         the iran threat reduction and syrian human rights act of  itra expands the scope of us sanctions against iran notably itra prohibits foreign entities that are majority owned or controlled by us persons from engaging in transactions with iran that would be contrary to the sanctions regulations if undertaken by a us person in addition section  of the itra amended the exchange act to require public reporting companies to disclose in their annual or quarterly reports any dealings or transactions the company or its affiliates engaged in during the previous reporting period involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions in some cases itra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under us law or were conducted outside of the united states by a foreign affiliate to our knowledge none of our activities during the year ended december   are required to be disclosed pursuant to itra except for certain activities of portfolio companies as disclosed in exhibit  to this annual report we are required to separately file concurrently with this annual report a notice that such activities have been disclosed in this annual report the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within  days of initiating such an investigation to determine whether sanctions should be imposed disclosure of such activity even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business         similar laws in nonus jurisdictions such as eu sanctions or the uk bribery act as well as other applicable antibribery anticorruption antimoney laundering or sanction or other export control laws in the us and abroad may also impose stricter or more onerous requirements than the fcpa ofac the us department of commerce and the us department of state and implementing them may disrupt our business or cause us to incur significantly more costs to comply with those laws different laws may also contain conflicting provisions making compliance with all laws more difficult if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm incarceration of our employees restrictions on our operations and other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition we may be subject to successor liability for fcpa violations or other acts of bribery committed by companies in which we or our funds invest or which we or our funds acquire         in june  the sec approved rule  under the advisers act regarding pay to play practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government clients and elected officials able to exert influence on such clients among other restrictions the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government client for two years subject to very limited exceptions after the investment adviser its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed among other matters to track contributions by certain of the advisers employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in order to enable the sec to determine compliance with the rule there has also been similar rulemaking on a statelevel regarding pay to play practices by investment advisers including in california and new york any failure on our part to comply with  table of contents these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage         certain laws to which we are subject such as certain environmental laws takeover laws antibribery and anticorruption laws escheat or abandoned property laws and antitrust laws may impose requirements on us and our portfolio companies as an affiliated group and in some cases impose concepts such as joint and several liability or notification obligations on affiliates for example the united kingdom introduced a crc energy efficiency scheme which requires under certain circumstances that funds general partners and portfolio companies participate in the scheme as a single organization and aggregate the energy supplies made to each of them in addition the scheme imposes joint and several liability for compliance on the entities within the organization moreover certain nonus jurisdictions may seek to make us liable for the antitrust violations if any committed by certain of our portfolio companies similarly our portfolio companies may be subject to contractual obligations which may impose obligations or restrictions on their affiliates the interpretation of such contractual provisions will depend on local laws given that we do not control all of our portfolio companies and that our portfolio companies generally operate independently of each other there is a risk that we could contravene one or more of such laws regulations and contractual arrangements due to limited access and opportunities to monitor compliance in addition compliance with these laws or contracts could require us to commit significant resources and capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs         our operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions and the level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved see businessregulation the potential requirement to convert our financial statements from being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to international financial reporting standards may materially strain our resources and materially increase our annual expenses         the sec may require in the future that we report our financial results under international financial reporting standards or ifrs instead of under us gaap ifrs is a set of accounting principles that has been gaining acceptance on a worldwide basis these standards are published by the londonbased international accounting standards board iasb and are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed rules than us gaap today there remain significant and material differences in several key areas between us gaap and ifrs which would affect us if we were required to prepare financial statements in conformity with ifrs additionally us gaap provides specific guidance in classes of accounting transactions for which equivalent guidance in ifrs does not exist the adoption of ifrs is highly complex and would have an impact on many aspects and operations of kkr including but not limited to financial accounting and reporting systems internal controls taxes borrowing covenants and cash management it is expected that a significant amount of time internal and external resources and expenses over a multiyear period would be required for this conversion we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity         the investment decisions we make in our investment management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of our portfolio companies may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation arising from dissatisfaction of fund investors with the performance of their funds the activities of our portfolio companies and a variety of other litigation claims see the section entitled litigation appearing in note  commitments and contingencies of our financial statements included elsewhere in this report by way of example we our funds and certain of our employees are each exposed to the risks of litigation relating to investment activities of our funds and  table of contents actions taken by the officers and directors some of whom may be kkr employees of portfolio companies such as the risk of shareholder litigation by other shareholders of public companies or holders of debt instruments of companies in which our funds have significant investments we are also exposed to risks of litigation or investigation in the event of any transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed         to the extent investors in our investment funds suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct such investors may have remedies against us our investment funds our principals or our affiliates under federal securities law and state law investors in our funds do not have legal remedies against us the general partners of our funds our funds our principals or our affiliates solely based on their dissatisfaction with the investment performance of those funds while the general partners and investment advisers to our investment funds including their directors officers other employees and affiliates are generally indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our investment funds such indemnity generally does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct         in addition we have formed and may continue to form funds targeting retail investors which may subject us to additional risk of litigation and regulatory scrutiny seeextensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business         if any civil or criminal lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability or culpability the lawsuit could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could seriously impact our business we depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain fund investors and qualified professionals and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds as a result allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us our investment activities or the private equity industry in general whether or not valid may harm our reputation which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses         in addition with a workforce composed of many highly paid professionals we face the risk of litigation relating to claims for compensation or other damages which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount the cost of settling any such claims could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations misconduct of our employees or at our portfolio companies could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm         there is a risk that our principals and employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business we are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the assets we manage the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds invest even though we may be unable to control or mitigate such misconduct our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest if our employees were improperly to use or disclose confidential information we could suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position and current and future business relationships as well as face potentially significant litigation it is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if any of our employees or the  table of contents employees of portfolio companies were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct our business and our reputation could be adversely affected underwriting activities expose us to risks         kkr capital markets llc a subsidiary of ours may act as an underwriter in securities offerings we may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness we purchased as an underwriter at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to potential liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite we are subject to risks in using prime brokers custodians administrators and other agents         certain of our investment funds and our capital markets and principal activities business depend on the services of prime brokers custodians administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities transactions in the event of the insolvency of a prime broker andor custodian our funds may not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime brokers and custodians unsecured creditors in relation to assets which the prime broker or custodian borrows lends or otherwise uses in addition our and our funds cash held with a prime broker or custodian may not be segregated from the prime brokers or custodians own cash and our funds therefore may rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto the inability to recover assets from the prime broker or custodian could have a material impact on the performance of our funds and our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to the assets we manage         as an investment manager we sponsor and manage funds that make investments worldwide on behalf of thirdparty investors and in connection with those activities are required to deploy our own capital in those investments the investments of these funds are subject to many risks and uncertainties which to the extent they are material are discussed below in addition we have principal investments and manage those assets on our own behalf as a result the gains and losses on such assets are reflected in our net income and the risks set forth below relating to the assets that we manage will directly affect our operating performance the historical returns attributable to our funds including those presented in this report should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns on our common units         we have presented in this report certain information relating to our investment returns such as net and gross irrs multiples of invested capital and realized and unrealized investment values for funds that we have sponsored and managed the historical and potential future returns of the funds that we manage are not directly linked to returns on kkr group partnership units         moreover historical returns of our funds may not be indicative of the future results that you should expect from us which could negatively impact the fees and incentive amounts received by us from such funds in particular our funds future results may differ significantly from their historical results including for the following reasons  the rates of returns of our funds reflect unrealized gains as of the applicable valuation date that may never be realized which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds investments  table of contents  the historical returns that we present in this report derive largely from the performance of our earlier private equity funds whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds which may have little or no investment track record and in particular you will not benefit from any value that was created in our funds prior to the kpe transaction to the extent such value has been realized and we may be required to repay excess amounts previously received in respect of carried interest in our funds if upon liquidation of the fund we have received carried interest distributions in excess of the amount to which we were entitled  the future performance of our funds will be affected by macroeconomic factors including negative factors arising from disruptions in the global financial markets that were not prevalent in the periods relevant to the historical return data included in this report  in some historical periods the rates of return of some of our funds have been positively influenced by a number of investments that experienced a substantial decrease in the average holding period of such investments and rapid and substantial increases in value following the dates on which those investments were made the actual or expected length of holding periods related to investments is likely longer than such historical periods those trends and rates of return may not be repeated in the future  our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital  our funds returns have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions in certain historical periods that may not repeat themselves and there can be no assurance that our current or future funds will be able to avail themselves of comparable investment opportunities or market conditions and  we may create new funds and investment products in the future that reflect a different asset mix in terms of allocations among funds investment strategies geographic and industry exposure vintage year and economic terms         in addition our historical rates of return reflect our historical cost structure which has varied and may vary further in the future certain of our newer funds for example have lower fee structures and also have performance hurdles future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this report including risks of the industry sectors and businesses in which a particular fund invests and changes in laws see risks related to our businessdifficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subjective and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized which could result in significant losses for our funds         there are no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our investment funds and our finance vehicles when determining fair values of investments we use the last reported market price as of the statement of financial condition date for investments that have readily observable market prices when an investment does not have a readily available market price the fair value of the investment represents the value as determined by us in good faith at which the investment could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and in many cases fair value is best expressed as a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived when making fair value determinations for our private equity  table of contents investments we typically use a market multiples approach that considers a specified financial measure such as ebitda andor a discounted cash flow analysis to value our energy and infrastructure investments we generally utilize a discounted cash flow analysis while we use a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis to value our real estate investments credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers and where these values are not available credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm each of these methodologies requires estimates of key inputs and significant assumptions and judgments we also consider a range of additional factors that we deem relevant including the applicability of a control premium or illiquidity discount the presence of significant unconsolidated assets and liabilities any favorable or unfavorable tax attributes the method of likely exit financial projections estimates of assumed growth rates terminal values discount rates including risk free rates capital structure risk premiums and other factors and determining these factors may involve a significant degree of our managements judgment and the judgment of management of our portfolio companies changes in these factors can have a significant effect on the results of the valuation methodologies used to value our portfolio and our reported fair values for these assets could vary materially if the inputs and other assumptions used from prior quarters were to change significantly for example if applicable interest rates rise then the assumed cost of capital for these assets would be expected to increase under a discounted cash flow analysis and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors conversely a fall in interest rates would be expected to positively impact valuations of these assets if not offset by other factors as a result of the significant assumptions underlying our valuations our valuations may differ from those of other investors holding the identical investment that we hold         because valuations and in particular valuations of investments for which market quotations are not readily available are inherently uncertain may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if a ready market had existed even if market quotations are available for our investments such quotations may not reflect the value that we would actually be able to realize because of various factors including possible illiquidity associated with a large ownership position subsequent illiquidity in the market for a companys securities future market price volatility or the potential for a future loss in market value based on poor industry conditions or the markets view of overall company and management performance our partners capital could be adversely affected if the values of investments that we record is materially higher than the values that are ultimately realized upon the disposal of the investments and changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in our aum and such changes could materially affect the results of operations that we report from period to period there can be no assurance that the investment values that we record from time to time will ultimately be realized and that you will be able to realize the investment values that are presented in this report         because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments the fair values of investments reflected in an investment funds or finance vehicles net asset value or nav do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the fund or finance vehicle when such investments are realized realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund navs would result in losses for the applicable fund and the loss of potential carried interest and other fees also if realizations of our investments produce values materially different than the carrying values reflected in prior fund navs fund investors may lose confidence in us which could in turn result in difficulty in raising capital for future funds         in addition because we value our entire portfolio only on a quarterly basis subsequent events that may have a material impact on those valuations may not be reflected until the next quarterly valuation date  table of contents dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments         because many of our funds investments rely heavily on the use of leverage our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our continued ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates for example our credit funds use varying degrees of leverage when making investments similarly in many private equity investments indebtedness may constitute  or more of a portfolio companys total debt and equity capitalization including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment and a portfolio companys indebtedness may also increase in recapitalization transactions subsequent to the companys acquisition the absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our funds and our portfolio companies also an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness such as we experienced during  would make it more expensive to finance those investments in addition increases in interest rates could decrease the value of fixedrate debt investments that our finance vehicles or our funds make increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate private equity and other investments because other potential buyers including operating companies acting as strategic buyers may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following the acquisition of the asset in addition a portion of the indebtedness used to finance private equity investments often includes highyield debt securities issued in the capital markets capital markets are volatile and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates or at all when completing an investment         investments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic market and industry developments the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could among other things  subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants terms and conditions any violation of which would be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our ability to realize value from our investment  allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness  give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow which might limit the entitys ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities  limit the entitys ability to adjust to changing market conditions thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt  limit the entitys ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth and  limit the entitys ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing including for capital expenditures working capital or other general corporate purposes         a leveraged companys income and equity also tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than would otherwise be the case if money had not been borrowed as a result the risk of loss associated with a leveraged company is generally greater than for comparable companies with comparatively less debt for example leveraged companies could default on their debt obligations due to a decrease in  table of contents revenues and cash flow precipitated by an economic downturn or by poor relative performance at such a company         when our funds existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms or at all if the financing for such purposes were to be unavailable or uneconomic when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our funds existing portfolio investments start to come due these investments could be materially and adversely affected in the event of default or potential default under applicable financing arrangements one or more of our portfolio companies may go bankrupt which could give rise to substantial investment losses adverse claims or litigation against us or our employees and damage to our reputation         the majorityowned subsidiaries of kfn regularly use and have used significant leverage to finance their assets an inability by such subsidiaries to continue to raise or utilize leverage to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness or to maintain adequate levels of collateral under the terms of their collateralized loan obligations could limit their ability to grow their business reinvest principal cash distribute cash to kfn or fully execute their business strategy and kfns results of operations may be adversely affected if kfn is unable to maintain its operating results and access to capital resources kfn could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet its debt service and other obligations if we complete our merger with kfn we may experience similar problems         among the sectors particularly challenged by downturns in the global credit markets including the downturn experienced from  through  are the clo and leveraged finance markets kfn has and if we complete our merger with kfn we will have significant exposure to these markets through its clo subsidiaries each of which is a special purpose company that issued to kfn and other investors notes secured by a pool of collateral consisting primarily of corporate leveraged loans in most cases kfns clo holdings are deeply subordinated representing the clo subsidiarys substantial leverage which increases both the opportunity for higher returns as well as the magnitude of losses when compared to holders or investors that rank more senior to kfn in right of payment kfns clo subsidiaries have historically experienced an increase in downgrades depreciations in market value and defaults in respect of leveraged loans in their collateral during downturns in credit markets there can be no assurance that market conditions giving rise to these types of consequences will not occur reoccur subsist or become more acute in the future because kfns clo structures involve complex collateral and other arrangements the documentation for such structures is complex is subject to differing interpretations and involves legal risk in july  kfn surrendered for cancellation approximately  million in aggregate of notes issued to it by certain of its clos the surrendered notes were cancelled and the obligations due under such notes were deemed extinguished         our hedge fundoffunds longshort equity fund longshort credit fund other credit oriented funds and clos may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital the use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio a fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or debt obligations or may enter into derivative transactions such as total return swaps with counterparties that have embedded leverage the interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lostand the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbatedin the event of a decline in the market value of such securities or debt obligations gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the funds net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings however if  table of contents investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings the funds net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings         any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow the due diligence process that we undertake in connection with our investments may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment         before making our investments we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment the objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment to identify possible risks associated with that investment and in the case of private equity investments to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation when conducting due diligence we typically evaluate a number of important business financial tax accounting environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment outside consultants legal advisors accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment nevertheless when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment we rely on resources available to us including information provided by the target of the investment and in some circumstances thirdparty investigations the due diligence process may at times be subjective with respect to newly organized companies for which only limited information is available         instances of bribery fraud accounting irregularities and other improper illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions several of our funds invest in emerging market countries that may not have established laws and regulations that are as stringent as in more developed nations or where existing laws and regulations may not be consistently enforced for example our funds invest throughout jurisdictions that have material perceptions of corruption according to international rating standards such as transparency international and corruption perceptions index such as china india indonesia latin america the middle east and africa due diligence on investment opportunities in these jurisdictions is frequently more complicated because consistent and uniform commercial practices in such locations may not have developed bribery fraud accounting irregularities and corrupt practices can be especially difficult to detect in such locations         the due diligence conducted for certain of our public markets strategies is limited to publicly available information accordingly we cannot be certain that the due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts including fraud bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity including the existence of contingent liabilities we also cannot be certain that our due diligence investigations will result in investments being successful or that the actual financial performance of an investment will not fall short of the financial projections we used when evaluating that investment         when we conduct due diligence in making and monitoring investments in third party hedge funds we rely on information supplied by third party hedge funds or by service providers to such third party hedge funds the information we receive from them may not be accurate or complete and therefore we may not have all the relevant facts necessary to properly assess and monitor our funds investment in a particular hedge fund  table of contents our investment management activities involve investments in relatively highrisk illiquid assets and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the capital invested         many of our funds hold investments in securities that are not publicly traded in many cases our funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities at many points in time our funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration is available and then only at such times when we do not possess material nonpublic information the ability of many of our funds to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the capital markets and in particular the public equity markets for example the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is made even if the securities are publicly traded large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial length of time exposing our investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period in addition as certain of our funds have a finite term we could be forced to dispose of investments sooner than otherwise desirable accordingly under certain conditions our funds may be forced to either sell securities at lower prices than they had expected to realize or defer sales that they had planned to make potentially for a considerable period of time we have made and expect to continue to make significant capital investments in our current and future funds contributing capital to these funds is risky and we may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments the investments of our funds are subject to a number of inherent risks         our results are highly dependent on our continued ability to generate attractive returns from our investments investments made by our private equity credit or other investments involve a number of significant risks inherent to private equity credit and other investing including the following  companies in which investments are made may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their securities which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities or any collateral or guarantees provided with respect to their debt  companies in which investments are made are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons and as a result the death disability resignation or termination of one or more of those persons could have a material adverse impact on their business and prospects  companies in which investments are made may from time to time be parties to litigation may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations finance expansion or maintain their competitive position  instances of bribery fraud and other deceptive practices committed by senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds invest may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and if such fraud is discovered negatively affect the valuation of a funds investments as well as contribute to overall market volatility that can negatively impact a funds investment program  our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved either by expiration of such funds term or otherwise resulting in a lower than expected return on the investments and potentially on the fund itself  table of contents  our portfolio companies generally have capital structures established on the basis of financial projections based primarily on management judgments and assumptions and general economic conditions and other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of these financial projections which could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company and cause our funds performance to fall short of our expectations  executive officers directors and employees of an equity sponsor may be named as defendants in litigation involving a company in which an investment is made or is being made and we or our funds may indemnify such executive officers directors or employees for liability relating to such litigation  we or certain of our investment funds could potentially be held liable under erisa for the pension obligations of one or more of our portfolio companies if we or the investment fund were determined to be a trade or business under erisa and deemed part of the same controlled group as the portfolio company under such rules and the pension obligations of any particular portfolio company could be material in a recent decision of a federal appellate court  sun capital partners iii lp v new england teamsters  trucking indus pension fund  a private equity firm was held to be engaged in a trade or business under erisa  we advise funds that invest in businesses that operate in a variety of industries that are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation including companies that supply services to governmental agencies such as the telecommunications industry the defense and government services industry the healthcare industry and oil and gas industry that may involve greater risk due to rapidly changing market and governmental conditions in those sectors and  significant failures of our portfolio companies to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them could affect the ability of our funds to invest in other companies in certain industries in the future and could harm our reputation our investments in real assets such as real estate infrastructure assets and energy may expose us to increased risks and liabilities and may expose our unitholders to adverse tax consequences         investments in real assets which may include real estate infrastructure assets oil and gas properties and other energy may expose us to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership of real assets for example ownership of real assets in our funds or vehicles may increase our risk of liability under environmental laws that impose regardless of fault joint and several liability for the cost of remediating contamination and compensation for damages ownership of real assets may also present additional risk of liability for personal and property injury or impose significant operating challenges and costs for example with respect to compliance with zoning environmental or other applicable laws         without limiting the foregoing disclosure we note that investments that we have made and will continue to make in the oil and gas industries may present specific environmental safety and other inherent risks and such investments are subject to stringent and complex foreign federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations specific to oil and gas industries for example governing controls taxes transportation of oil and natural gas exploration and production permitting and various conservation laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas production and related operations in addition to regulations governing occupational health and safety the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas these laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production  table of contents below the rate that would otherwise be possible and increase the cost of production thus reducing profitability our oil and gas investments are subject to other risks such as  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered making it difficult to predict the future costs or impact of compliance  the oil and gas industries present inherent risk of personal and property injury for which we may not be fully insured  our estimated oil natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve quantities and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and value of our reserves  the performance of our energy investments depend on the skill ability and decisions of third party operators failure of such operators to comply with applicable laws rules and regulations could result in liabilities to us reduce the value of our interest in the oil and natural gas properties adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations  if commodity prices decline and remain depressed for a prolonged period a significant portion of our development projects may become uneconomic and cause write downs of the value of our oil and natural gas properties which may reduce the value of our energy investments have a negative impact on our ability to use these investments as collateral or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations         investments in real estate will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate related businesses and assets these risks include those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property general and local economic conditions changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area as a result for instance of overbuilding fluctuations in the average occupancy the financial resources of tenants changes in building environmental and other laws energy and supply shortages various uninsured or uninsurable risks natural disasters changes in government regulations such as rent control changes in real property tax rates changes in interest rates the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity environmental liabilities contingent liabilities on disposition of assets terrorist attacks war and other factors that are beyond our control in addition if we acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property which may often be nonincome producing they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals the cost and timely completion of construction including risks beyond the control of our fund such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms         in addition investments in real assets may cause adverse tax consequences for certain nonus unitholders regarding income effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business and the imposition of certain tax withholding please see risks related to us taxationnonus persons face unique us tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them moreover investments in real assets may also require all our unitholders to file tax returns and pay taxes in various state and local jurisdictions in the us and abroad where these real assets are located please see risks related to us taxationholders of our common units may be subject to state local and foreign taxes and return filing requirements as a result of owning such common units  table of contents certain of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings such investments may be subject to a greater risk of poor performance or loss         certain of our investment funds especially in our special situations strategy may invest in business enterprises involved in workouts liquidations reorganizations bankruptcies and similar transactions and may purchase high risk receivables an investment in such business enterprises entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received in addition if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by us federal and state and nonus laws relating to among other things fraudulent conveyances voidable preferences lender liability and a bankruptcy courts discretionary power to disallow subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation which has the potential to adversely impact us or unrelated funds or portfolio companies because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies there is a potential risk of loss by a fund of its entire investment in such company our investment in nephila is exposed to natural catastrophe and weather risk         our investment in nephila an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk is exposed to a risk of reduced revenues resulting from natural disasters because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable historical results of operations of nephila may not be indicative of its future results of operations as a result of the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period the expected returns from this investment may fall short of our expectations we often pursue investment opportunities that involve business regulatory legal or other complexities         as an element of our investment style we often pursue complex investment opportunities this can often take the form of substantial business regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investment managers our tolerance for complexity presents risks as such transactions can be more difficult expensive and timeconsuming to finance and execute it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny the application of complex tax laws or a greater risk of contingent liabilities we may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities which could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or if they are known to us we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds in addition in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business a fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate these arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund even after the disposition of an investment any of these risks could harm the performance of our funds  table of contents our private equity investments are typically among the largest in the industry which involves certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small and mediumsized investments         our private equity funds make investments in companies with relatively large capitalizations which involves certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in smalland mediumsized investments for example larger transactions may be more difficult to finance and exiting larger deals may present incremental challenges in addition larger transactions may pose greater challenges in implementing changes in the companys management culture finances or operations and may entail greater scrutiny by regulators interest groups and other third parties these constituencies may be more active in opposing some larger investments by certain private equity firms         in some transactions the amount of equity capital that is required to complete a large capitalization private equity transaction may be significant and are required to be structured as a consortium transaction a consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more other private equity firms serve together or collectively as equity sponsors while we have sought to limit where possible the amount of consortium transactions in which we have been involved we have participated in a significant number of those transactions consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by our firm over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other consortium investors accordingly we may not be able to control decisions relating to a consortium investment including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit which could result in the risks described in our funds have made investments in companies that we do not control exposing us to the risk of decisions made by others with which we may not agree any of these factors could increase the risk that our larger investments could be less successful the consequences to our investment funds of an unsuccessful larger investment could be more severe given the size of the investment we and our funds have made investments in companies that we do not control exposing us to the risk of decisions made by others with which we may not agree         our funds and accounts hold investments that include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control and such investments may comprise an increasing part of our business such instruments and securities may be acquired by our funds and accounts through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer in addition our funds and accounts may acquire minority equity interests particularly when making private equity investments in asia or sponsoring investments as part of a large investor consortium and may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds or accounts retaining a minority investment we have made certain minority investments in publicly traded companies these transactions could be viewed as unwanted damage our reputation and consequently impair our ability to source transactions in the future those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests if any of the foregoing were to occur the value of the investments by our funds or accounts could decrease and our financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected in addition many of our investments in our public markets funds vehicles and accounts are in companies or other funds that we do not control         we have also recently made minority investments with our principal assets for example our interest in nephila and may in the future acquire interests in other investment managers and businesses to the extent these businesses fail to comply with applicable regulations or laws or otherwise suffer reputational damage our reputation may suffer  table of contents we make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states         many of our funds vehicles and accounts invest or have the flexibility to invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity debt loans or other securities of issuers that are based outside of the united states a substantial amount of these investments consist of private equity investments made by our private equity funds for example as of december   approximately  of the unrealized value of the investments of those funds and accounts was attributable to foreign investments investing in companies that are based in countries outside of the united states and in particular in emerging markets such as china india turkey countries in south and southeast asia latin america and africa involves risks and considerations that are not typically associated with investments in companies established in the united states these risks may include the following  the possibility of exchange control regulations restrictions on repatriation of profit on investments or of capital invested political and social instability nationalization or expropriation of assets  the imposition of nonus taxes  differences in the legal and regulatory environment for example the recognition of information barriers or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance  greater levels of corruption and potential exposure to the fcpa and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments their officials and other third parties  violations of sanctions regimes  limitations on borrowings to be used to fund acquisitions or dividends  limitations on permissible counterparties in our transactions or consolidation rules that effectively restrict the types of businesses in which we may invest  political risks generally including political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors  less liquid markets  reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs service providers andor distribution mechanisms  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another  higher rates of inflation  less available current information about an issuer  higher transaction costs  less government supervision of exchanges brokers and issuers  less developed bankruptcy and other laws  greater application of concepts like equitable subordination which may in bankruptcy or insolvency result in the subordination of debt or other senior interests held by our investment funds vehicles or accounts in companies in which our investment funds vehicles or accounts also hold equity interests  difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations  table of contents  lack of uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards  less stringent requirements relating to fiduciary duties  fewer investor protections and  greater price volatility         as a result of the complexity of and lack of clear laws precedent or authority with respect to the application of various income tax laws to our structures the application of rules governing how transactions and structures should be reported is also subject to differing interpretations in particular certain jurisdictions including denmark france south korea and japan among others have either proposed or adopted rules that seek to limit the amount of interest that may be deductible where the lender and the borrower are related parties or where third party borrowings have been guaranteed by a related party and in the case of germany without regard to whether the parties are related or may seek to interpret existing rules in a more restrictive manner in addition the tax authorities of certain countries such as germany belgium france south korea and singapore have sought to disallow tax deductions for transaction and certain other costs at the portfolio company level either on the basis that the entity claiming the deduction does not benefit from the costs incurred or on other grounds there is also significant risk in germany that tax losses and interest carry forwards would lose their value on a change of ownership due to restrictive legislation these measures will most likely adversely affect portfolio companies in those jurisdictions in which our investment funds have investments and limit the benefits of additional investments in those countries our business is also subject to the risk that similar measures might be introduced in other countries in which our investment funds currently have investments or plan to invest in the future or that other legislative or regulatory measures that negatively affect their respective portfolio investments might be promulgated in any of the countries in which they invest         in addition certain countries such as australia china india japan and south korea where we have made investments have sought to tax investment gains derived by nonresident investors including private equity funds from the disposition of the equity in companies operating in those countries in some cases this development is the result of new legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing legislation and local authority assertions that investors have a local taxable presence or are holding companies for trading purposes rather than for capital purposes or are not otherwise entitled to treaty benefits with respect to india a general antiavoidance rule was introduced that would provide a basis for the tax authorities to subject other sales and investments through intermediate holding jurisdictions such as mauritius to indian tax the proposed rule is presently scheduled to become effective for tax years beginning on or after april           further the tax authorities in certain countries such as australia belgium china denmark germany and south korea have sought to deny the benefits of income tax treaties or eu directives with respect to withholding taxes on interest and dividends and in the case of south korea capital gains of nonresident entities on the basis that the entity benefiting from such treaty or directive is not the owner of the income is a mere conduit inserted primarily to access treaty benefits or directives or otherwise lacks substance         as a result of the complexity of our structures foreign jurisdictions may seek to tax a material portion of the fee income associated with our management advisory activity due to the complexity sophistication and global nature of our investment decision making function foreign jurisdictions may assert that a material amount of fee income was associated with a taxable presence in their jurisdiction and assert that such income is subject to local tax potentially reducing our profits associated with such income although this risk may be mitigated by the availability of foreign tax credits         although we expect that most of the capital commitments of our funds vehicles and accounts will be denominated in us dollars our investments and capital commitments that are denominated in a  table of contents foreign currency such as euro will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances the ability of countries to pay their national debt levels of shortterm interest rates differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies longterm opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments we may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks but we can offer no assurance that such strategies will be effective or even available at all if we engage in hedging transactions we may be exposed to additional risks associated with such transactions see risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our investments third party investors in our funds with commitmentbased structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us which could adversely affect a funds operations and performance         investors in certain of our funds make capital commitments to those funds that the funds are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods we depend on fund investors fulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for such funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations for example management fees when due any fund investor that did not fund a capital call would generally be subject to several possible penalties including having a significant amount of existing investment forfeited in that fund however the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital for instance early in the life of the fund then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful investors may in the future also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund thereby inhibiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call if our fund investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected our equity investments and many of our debt investments often rank junior to investments made by others exposing us to greater risk of losing our investment         in many cases the companies in which our funds invest have or are permitted to have outstanding indebtedness or equity securities that rank senior to our funds investment by their terms such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of distributions interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our investment also in the event of insolvency liquidation dissolution reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of its investment in addition debt investments made by our investment funds vehicles or accounts in our portfolio companies may be equitably subordinated to the debt investments made by third parties in our portfolio companies after repaying senior security holders the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment to the extent that any assets remain holders of claims that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets also during periods of financial distress or following an insolvency the ability of our funds to influence a companys affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors  table of contents risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our investments         when managing exposure to market risks we employ hedging strategies or certain forms of derivative instruments to limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments including changes in prevailing interest rates and currency exchange rates the scope of risk management activities undertaken by us varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates prevailing foreign currency exchange rates the types of investments that are made and other changing market conditions the use of hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of a decline in the value of a position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines however such activities can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments thereby offsetting the decline in the value of the position such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases moreover it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a market development that is so generally anticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price         the success of any hedging or other derivative transactions that we enter into generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes as a result while we may enter into such transactions in order to reduce our exposure to market risks unanticipated market changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if the hedging or other derivative transaction had not been executed in addition the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in connection with hedging activities and price movements in a position being hedged may vary moreover for a variety of reasons we may not seek or be successful in establishing a perfect correlation between the instruments used in hedging or other derivative transactions and the positions being hedged an imperfect correlation could prevent us from achieving the intended result and could give rise to a loss in addition it may not be possible to fully or perfectly limit our exposure against all changes in the value of its investments because the value of investments is likely to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors some of which will be beyond our control or ability to hedge         the cftc has proposed or adopted regulations governing swaps and security based swaps which may limit our trading activities and our ability to implement effective hedging strategies or increase the costs of compliance see risks related to our businessextensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could result in additional burdens on our business certain of our funds may make a limited number of investments or investments that are concentrated in certain geographic regions or asset types which could negatively affect their performance to the extent those concentrated investments perform poorly         the governing agreements of our funds contain only limited investment restrictions and only limited requirements as to diversification of fund investments either by geographic region or asset type our private equity funds generally permit up to  of the fund to be invested in a single company during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns in these sectors or geographic regions decreased revenues difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs may be exacerbated by this concentration of investments which would result in lower investment returns because a significant portion of a funds capital may be invested in a single investment or portfolio company a loss with respect to such investment or portfolio company could have a significant adverse impact on such funds capital accordingly a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect a funds performance and therefore our financial condition and results of operations  table of contents because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and direct coinvestments fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us         we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies through our management of private equity funds in our private markets segment as well as through separate investments in those funds and coinvestments in certain portfolio companies of such funds in our capital markets and principal activities segment as of december   we hold significant aggregate investments in each of alliance boots gmbh hca inc and first data corporation which each represent more than  of our capital markets and principal activities segment investment balance as a result of our disproportionate investment in these companies or any other portfolio companies for which similar investments are held in the future any fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us as compared to other portfolio companies our business activities may give rise to a conflict of interest with our funds         as we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to investment activities among our various funds and also our own account for example  in pursuing the interest of our fund investors we may take actions that could reduce our aum or our profits that we could otherwise realize in the short term  we may be required to allocate investment opportunities among investment vehicles that may have overlapping investment objectives including vehicles that may have different fee structures and among kkr coinvestment vehicles including vehicles in which kkr employees may investment and third party coinvestors  we may on behalf of our funds or kkr itself buy sell hold or otherwise deal with securities or other investments that may be purchased sold or held by our other funds or that are otherwise issued by a portfolio company in which our funds invest conflicts of interest may arise between a fund on one hand and kkr on the other or among our funds including but not limited to those relating to the purchase or sale of investments the structuring of or exercise of rights with respect to investment transactions and the advice we provide to our funds  we may invest on behalf of our fund or for our own account in a portfolio company of one fund that is a competitor service provider supplier customer or other counterparty with respect to a portfolio company of another fund  we may structure an investment in a manner that may be attractive to fund investors or to kkr holdings lp from a tax perspective but that may require corporate taxation to unitholders  a decision to acquire material nonpublic information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund or our own account may result in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action  our fiduciary obligations to our fund investors may preclude us from pursuing attractive proprietary investment opportunities in particular as we enter into strategic relationships with broad investment mandates similar to the investments we make with our principal assets  conflicts may arise in allocating time services or resources among the investment activities of our funds kkr other kkraffiliated entities and the employees of kkr  table of contents  our principals have made personal investments in a variety of our investment funds which may result in conflicts of interest among investors of our funds or unitholders regarding investment decisions for these funds  the general partners entitlement to receive carried interest from many of our funds may create an incentive for that general partner to make riskier and more speculative investments on behalf of a fund than would be the case in the absence of such an arrangement in addition for our funds that pay carried interest based on accrued rather than realized gains the amount of carried interest to which the general partner is entitled and the timing of its receipt of carried interest will depend on the valuation by the general partner of the funds investment  from time to time one of our funds may seek to effect a purchase or sale of an investment with one or more of our other funds in a socalled cross transaction  the investors in our investment vehicles are based in a wide variety of jurisdictions and take a wide variety of forms and consequently have diverging interests among themselves from a regulatory tax or legal perspective or with respect to investment policies and target riskreturn profiles  we or our affiliates including our capital markets business may receive fees or other compensation in connection with specific transactions or different clients that may give rise to conflicts the decision to take on an opportunity in one of our businesses may as a practical matter also limit the ability of one or our other businesses to take advantage of other related opportunities         in addition our funds and accounts also invest in a broad range of asset classes throughout the corporate capital structure these investments include investments in corporate loans and debt securities preferred equity securities and common equity securities in certain cases we may manage separate funds or accounts that invest in different parts of the same companys capital structure for example our credit funds may invest in different classes of the same companys debt and may make debt investments in a company that is owned by one of our private equity funds in those cases the interests of our funds and accounts may not always be aligned which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts for example one of our private equity funds could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition divestiture or other transaction that in its judgment could enhance the value of the private equity investment even though the proposed transaction would subject one of our credit funds debt investments to additional or increased risks finally our ability to effectively implement a public securities strategy may be limited to the extent that contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of our private equity business impose restrictions on our engaging in transactions that we may be interested in otherwise pursuing         we may also cause different investment funds to invest in a single portfolio company for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest conflicts may also arise where we make principal investments for our own account or permit employees to invest alongside our investment vehicles or our balance sheet for their own account in certain cases we may require that a transaction or investment be approved by fund investors or their advisory committees be approved by an independent valuation expert be subject to a fairness opinion be based on armslength pricing data or be calculated in accordance with a formula provided for in a funds governing documents prior to the completion of the relevant transaction to address potential conflicts of interest such instances include principal transactions where we or our affiliates warehouse an investment in a portfolio company for the benefit of one or more of our funds or accounts pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such funds or accounts followon investments by a fund other than a fund which made an initial investment in a company or transactions in which we arrange for one of our funds or accounts to buy a security from or sell a security to another one of our funds or accounts  table of contents         appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and we could suffer reputational damage or potential liability if we fail or appear to fail to deal appropriately with conflicts as they arise regulatory scrutiny of or litigation in connection with conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which could in turn materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways including as a result of an inability to raise additional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us if kfn were deemed to be an investment company subject to regulation under the investment company act applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business         our business would be adversely affected if kfn the publicly traded specialty finance company managed by us and with which we have signed a merger agreement was to be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act a person will generally be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act if absent an available exception or exemption it i is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities or ii owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding  of the value of its total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis we believe kfn is not and does not propose to be primarily engaged in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities and we do not believe that kfn has held itself out as such kfn conducts its operations primarily through its majorityowned subsidiaries each of which is either outside of the definition of an investment company as defined in the investment company act or excepted from such definition under the investment company act kfn monitors its holdings regularly to confirm its continued compliance with the  test described in clause ii above and restricts its subsidiaries with respect to the assets in which each of them can invest andor the types of securities each of them may issue in order to ensure conformity with exceptions provided by and rules and regulations promulgated under the investment company act if the sec were to disagree with kfns treatment of one or more of its subsidiaries as being excepted from the investment company act with its determination that one or more of its other holdings are not investment securities for purposes of the  test or with its determinations as to the nature of its business or the manner in which it holds itself out kfn andor one or more of its subsidiaries could be required either i to change substantially the manner in which it conducts its operations to avoid being subject to the investment company act or ii to register as an investment company either of these would likely have a material adverse effect on kfn its ability to service its indebtedness and to make distributions on its shares and on the market price of its shares and securities and could thereby materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations         on august   the sec published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding rule a and a concept release seeking information on section cc two provisions with which kfns subsidiaries must comply under the  test described above among the issues for which the sec has requested comment is whether rule a should be modified so that parent companies of subsidiaries that rely on rule a should treat their interests in such subsidiaries as investment securities for purposes of the  test the sec is also seeking information about the nature of entities that invest in mortgages and mortgagerelated pools and how the sec staffs interpretive positions in connection with section cc affect these entities any guidance or action from the sec or its staff including changes that the sec may ultimately propose and adopt to the way rule a applies to entities or new or modified interpretive positions related to section cc could further inhibit kfns ability or the ability of any of its subsidiaries to pursue its current or future operating strategies which could have a material adverse effect on kfn and on us  table of contents investors in certain of our public markets funds may redeem their investments in these funds with minimal notice         investors in our funds of funds along with those in our longshort equity strategy longshort credit strategy and similar investment vehicles may generally submit redemptions to redeem their investments on a quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time or in certain cases capital may be withdrawn earlier subject to a fee in each case subject to the applicable funds specific redemption provisions for certain kkr prisma funds managed as part of a single investors mandate the length of time to redeem an investment may vary and will depend on the liquidity constraints of each kkr prisma funds underlying portfolio factors which could result in investors leaving our funds include changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest unhappiness with a funds performance or investment strategy changes in our reputation departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals performance and liquidity needs of fund investors in a declining market or period of economic disruption or uncertainty the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our aum could accelerate the decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions from our funds of funds or other similar investment vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues net income and cash flows         a portion of assets invested in our fund of hedge funds strategy are managed through separately managed accounts or entities structured for investment by one investor or related investors whereby we earn management and incentive fees and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account or single entity mandates the investment management agreements we enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts or entities on behalf of certain clients may be terminated by such clients on as little as  days prior written notice or less in certain prescribed circumstances in addition the boards of directors of the certain funds we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies on as little as  days prior written notice similarly we provide subadvisory services to other investment advisors and managers such investment advisors and managers could terminate our subadvisory agreements on as little as  days prior written notice in the case of any such terminations the management and incentive fees we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues         a fund of funds is subject to risks related to the limited rights it has to withdraw transfer or otherwise liquidate its investments from the underlying hedge funds or other funds in which it invests hedge funds including those in which our fund of funds are invested and the hedge funds we offer to our fund investors may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume increased price volatility concentrated trading positions limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which they may be a party and changes in industry and government regulations it may be impossible or costly for hedge funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls withdrawal requests or otherwise particularly if there are other market participants seeking to dispose of similar assets at the same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise         moreover these risks may be exacerbated for funds of funds such as those we manage for example if one of our funds of funds were to invest a significant portion of its assets in two or more hedge funds that each had illiquid positions in the same issuer the illiquidity risk for our funds of hedge funds would be compounded in  many hedge funds experienced significant declines in value in many cases these declines in value were both provoked and exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets often at distressed prices moreover certain funds of funds were invested in hedge funds that halted redemptions in the face of illiquidity and other issues which precluded those  table of contents funds of funds from receiving their capital back on request there can be no guarantee that such a situation would not recur particularly in times of market distress         terms of the governing documents in may also limit a fund of funds ability to withdraw transfer or otherwise liquidate their investments in underlying portfolio funds under the terms of the governing documents of the relevant portfolio funds or other investments the ability of a fund of funds or account to redeem any amount invested therein may be subject to certain restrictions and conditions including restrictions on the redemption of capital for an initial period restrictions on the amount of redemptions and the frequency with which redemptions can be made and investment minimums that must be maintained additionally portfolio funds typically reserve the right to reduce gate or suspend redemptions to set aside side pocket capital that cannot be redeemed for so long as an event or circumstance has not occurred or ceased to exist respectively and to satisfy redemptions by making distributions inkind under certain circumstances the ability of our funds of funds or accounts to redeem portfolio fund interests may be adversely affected to varying degrees by such restrictions depending on among other things the length of any restricted periods imposed by the portfolio fund the amount and timing of a requested redemption in relation to the time remaining of any restricted periods imposed by portfolio funds the aggregate amount of redemption requests the next regularly scheduled redemption dates of such portfolio funds the imposition of gates or suspensions the use of side pockets the decision by a portfolio fund to satisfy redemptions inkind and the satisfaction of other conditions         in addition certain funds in our public markets business are registered under the investment company act as management investment companies these funds and kkr asset management llc which serves as their investment adviser or in the case of the business development company as its subadviser are subject to the investment company act and the rules thereunder one of these funds is a new york stock exchangelisted closedend fund in addition the management fees we are paid for managing the investment company will generally be subject to contractual rights the companys board of directors or in the case of the business development company we manage the investment adviser has to terminate our management of an account on as short as  days prior notice termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations investments by our fund of funds longshort equity strategy longshort credit strategy and any other hedge funds and similar investment vehicles are subject to numerous additional risks         investments by one or more hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics that we currently advise or may organize in the future are subject to numerous additional risks including the following  our longshort equity and longshort credit strategies are newly established without any operating history and we do not have any significant track record as a hedge fund manager  generally there are few limitations on the execution of investment strategies of a hedge fund or fund of funds which are subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds  hedge funds may engage in short selling which is subject to theoretically unlimited loss in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the short position there can be no assurance that the security necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further thereby exacerbating the loss  table of contents  hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract whether or not bona fide or because of a credit or liquidity problem thus causing the fund to suffer a loss counterparty risk is accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement or where the fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties generally hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty moreover the funds internal consideration of the creditworthiness of their counterparties may prove insufficient the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses  credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions this systemic risk may adversely affect the financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which the hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics interact on a daily basis  the efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments a hedge funds trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances including systems failures or human error in such event the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position or if the overall position were to need adjustment the funds might not be able to make such adjustment as a result the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds and might incur a loss in liquidating their position  hedge funds and funds of funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets hedge funds and funds of funds directly or indirectly may make investments in restricted or illiquid investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by registration requirements decreased trading volume increased price volatility concentrated trading positions limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which they may be a party and changes in industry and government regulations it may be impossible or costly for hedge funds or funds of funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls redemption requests or otherwise particularly if there are other market participants seeking to dispose of similar assets at the same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise in addition in a declining market or in the event fund investors otherwise demand greater liquidity the pace of redemptions could accelerate requiring hedge funds or funds of funds to sell assets on unfavorable terms  hedge fund investments are also subject to risks relating to investments in commodities futures options and other derivatives the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances including if the fund writes a call option price movements of commodities futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to swap agreements are influenced by among other things interest rates changing supply and demand relationships trade fiscal monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies the value of futures options and swap agreements also depends upon the price of the commodities underlying them in addition hedge funds assets are subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or counterparties most  table of contents us commodities exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity interest prices during a single day by imposing daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits the existence of which may reduce liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets our fund of hedge fund business may also be subject to and may subject our firm to extensive regulations including those of the commodity futures trading commission and the regulations described under risks related to our businessextensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties the possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could result in additional burdens on our business risks related to our common units as a limited partnership we qualify for some exemptions from the corporate governance and other requirements of the nyse         we are a limited partnership and as a result qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the nyse pursuant to these exceptions limited partnerships may elect and we have elected not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nyse including the requirements i that the listed company have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors ii that the listed company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and iii that the compensation committee be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants legal counsel and other committee advisers in addition as a limited partnership we are not required to obtain unitholder approval for a the issuance of common units to certain related parties where the number of common units exceeds one percent of the outstanding common units or voting power b the issuance of common units that equals or exceeds  of the outstanding common units or voting power or c a change of control transaction and we are not required to hold annual unitholder meetings accordingly you do not have the same protections afforded to equity holders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse our founders are able to determine the outcome of any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our limited partners         as of february   kkr holdings owns  kkr group partnership units and our senior principals generally have sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the holders of our common units including a merger or consolidation of our business a sale of all or substantially all of our assets and amendments to our partnership agreement that may be material to holders of our common units in addition our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that enable us to take actions that would materially and adversely affect all holders of our common units or a particular class of holders of common units upon the majority vote of all outstanding voting units and since more than a majority of our voting units are controlled by kkr holdings kkr holdings has the ability to take actions that could materially and adversely affect the holders of our common units either as a whole or as a particular class  table of contents         the voting rights of holders of our common units are further restricted by provisions in our limited partnership agreement stating that any of our common units held by a person that beneficially owns  or more of any class of our common units then outstanding other than our managing partner or its affiliates or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our managing partner or its affiliates cannot be voted on any matter our limited partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of the holders of our common units to call meetings to acquire information about our operations and to influence the manner or direction of our management our limited partnership agreement does not restrict our managing partners ability to take actions that may result in our partnership being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for us federal and applicable state income tax purposes furthermore holders of our common units would not be entitled to dissenters rights of appraisal under our limited partnership agreement or applicable delaware law in the event of a merger or consolidation a sale of substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties of our managing partner and limit remedies available to unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty it will be difficult for unitholders to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our managing partner or by its conflicts committee         our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that require holders of our common units to waive or consent to conduct by our managing partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law for example our limited partnership agreement provides that when our managing partner is acting in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as our managing partner it may act without any fiduciary obligations to holders of our common units whatsoever when our managing partner in its capacity as our general partner or our conflicts committee is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or discretion or that it deems necessary or appropriate or necessary or advisable then our managing partner or the conflicts committee will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires including its own interests and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any holder of our common units and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by our limited partnership agreement the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act which is referred to as the delaware limited partnership act or under any other law rule or regulation or in equity these standards reduce the obligations to which our managing partner would otherwise be held see also we are a delaware limited partnership and there are provisions in our limited partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the delaware general corporation law dgcl in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders         the above modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted by delaware law hence we and holders of our common units will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our managing partner if our managing partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our limited partnership agreement unless our managing partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our limited partnership agreement we and holders of our common units will not have any recourse against our managing partner even if our managing partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties furthermore even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our limited partnership agreement our limited partnership agreement provides that our managing partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us or holders of our common units for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our managing partner or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct these provisions are detrimental to the holders of our common units because they restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions that without such limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duties  table of contents         whenever a potential conflict of interest exists between us and our managing partner our managing partner may resolve such conflict of interest if our managing partner determines that its resolution of the conflict of interest is on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or is fair and reasonable to us taking into account the totality of the relationships between us and our managing partner then it will be presumed that in making this determination our managing partner acted in good faith a holder of our common units seeking to challenge this resolution of the conflict of interest would bear the burden of overcoming such presumption this is different from the situation with delaware corporations where a conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of demonstrating that the resolution was fair         also if our managing partner obtains the approval of the conflicts committee of our managing partner the resolution will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to us and not a breach by our managing partner of any duties it may owe to us or holders of our common units this is different from the situation with delaware corporations where a conflict resolution by a committee consisting solely of independent directors may in certain circumstances merely shift the burden of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff if you purchase receive or otherwise hold a common unit you will be treated as having consented to the provisions set forth in our limited partnership agreement including provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that in the absence of such provisions might be considered a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law as a result unitholders will as a practical matter not be able to successfully challenge an informed decision by the conflicts committee         we have also agreed to indemnify our managing partner and any of its affiliates and any member partner tax matters partner officer director employee agent fiduciary or trustee of our partnership our managing partner or any of our affiliates and certain other specified persons to the fullest extent permitted by law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities joint or several expenses including legal fees and expenses judgments fines penalties interest settlements or other amounts incurred by our managing partner or these other persons we have agreed to provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct we have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings         our managing partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units as provided in our limited partnership agreement or assign this right to one of its affiliates or to us our managing partner may use its own discretion free of fiduciary duty restrictions in determining whether to exercise this right as a result a unitholder may have his common units purchased from him at an undesirable time or price for additional information see our limited partnership agreement filed as an exhibit to this annual report         any claims suits actions or proceedings concerning the matters described above or any other matter arising out of or relating in any way to the limited partnership agreement may only be brought in the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof any other court in the state of delaware with subject matter jurisdiction the market price and trading volume of our common units may be volatile which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our common unitholders         the market price of our common units may be highly volatile could be subject to wide fluctuations and could decline significantly in the future in addition the trading volume in our common units may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur if the market price of our common units declines significantly you may be unable to sell your common units at an attractive  table of contents price if at all some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common units or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common units include  variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions which may be substantial  our policy of taking a longterm perspective on making investment operational and strategic decisions which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns  failure to meet analysts earnings estimates  publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units sufficiently  additions or departures of our principals and other key management personnel  adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future  changes in market valuations of similar companies  speculation in the press or investment community  changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations or announcements relating to these matters  a lack of liquidity in the trading of our common units  adverse publicity about the investment management or private equity industry generally or individual scandals specifically and  general market and economic conditions an investment in our common units is not an investment in any of our funds and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us         our common units are securities of kkr  co lp only while our historical consolidated and combined financial information includes financial information including assets and revenues of certain funds on a consolidated basis and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these funds such assets and revenues are available to the fund and not to us except to a limited extent through management fees carried interest or other incentive income distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds as discussed in more detail in this report our common unit price may decline due to the large number of common units eligible for future sale for exchange and issuable pursuant to our equity incentive plan and acquisitions         the market price of our common units could decline as a result of sales of a large number of common units in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell common units in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate as of february   we have  common units outstanding which amount excludes common units beneficially owned by kkr holdings in the form of kkr group partnership units discussed below and common units available for future issuance under the kkr  co lp  equity incentive plan which we refer to as our equity incentive plan         as of february   kkr holdings owns  kkr group partnership units that may be exchanged on a quarterly basis for our common units on a oneforone basis subject to

amount of cash that is available for distribution to holders of kkr group partnership units  our managing partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in resolving conflicts of interest which has the effect of limiting its duties including fiduciary duties to us for example our affiliates that serve as the general partners of our funds or as brokerdealers have fiduciary andor contractual obligations to our fund investors or other third parties such obligations may cause such affiliates to regularly take actions with respect to the allocation of investments among our investment funds including funds that have different fee structures the purchase or sale of investments in our investment funds the structuring of investment transactions for those funds and the advice and services we provide that comply with these fiduciary and contractual obligations but that might adversely affect our nearterm results of operations or cash flow our managing partner will have no obligation to intervene in or to notify us of such actions by such affiliates  because certain of our principals indirectly hold their kkr group partnership units through kkr holdings lp

foregoing were to occur we could experience difficulty in making new investments and the value of our existing investments our business our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer we intend to pay periodic distributions to the holders of our common units but our ability to do so may be limited by our holding company structure and contractual restrictions         we intend to pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis we are a holding company and have no material assets other than the kkr group partnership units that we hold through whollyowned subsidiaries and have no independent means of generating income accordingly we intend to cause the kkr group partnerships to make distributions on the kkr group partnership units including kkr group partnership units that we directly or indirectly hold in order to provide us with sufficient amounts to fund distributions we may declare if the kkr group partnerships make such distributions other holders of kkr group partnership units including kkr holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their kkr group partnership units         the declaration and payment of any future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our managing partner which may change our distribution policy at any time our managing partner will take into account general economic and business conditions our strategic plans and prospects our business and investment opportunities our financial condition and operating results compensation expense working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs debt and contractual restrictions and obligations including payment obligations pursuant to the tax receivable agreement legal tax and regulatory restrictions restrictions or other implications on the payment of distributions by us to the holders of kkr group partnership units or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our managing partner may deem relevant under the delaware limited partnership act we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of our assets if we were to make such an impermissible distribution any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware limited partnership act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years furthermore by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses we risk slowing the pace of our growth or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures should the need arise         our ability to characterize such distributions as capital gains or qualified dividend income may be limited and you should expect that some or all of such distributions may be regarded as ordinary income we will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis stepup we receive in connection with subsequent exchanges of our common units and related transactions         we and one or more of our intermediate holding companies are required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings to the extent this occurs the exchanges are expected to result in an increase in one of our intermediate holding companys share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of kkr management holdings lp primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available this increase in tax basis may increase for tax purposes depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain or increase loss on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets  table of contents         we are party to a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings requiring our intermediate holding company to pay to kkr holdings or transferees of its kkr group partnership units  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of this increase in tax basis as well as  of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement a termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events this payment obligation will be an obligation of our intermediate holding companies and not of either kkr group partnership in the event that any of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire kkr group partnership units in the future or if we become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes we expect that each such entity will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms while the actual increase in tax basis as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors including the timing of exchanges the price of our common units at the time of the exchange the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our taxable income we expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships the payments that we may be required to make to our existing owners will be substantial the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our existing owners continued ownership of us we may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise in particular our intermediate holding companies obligations under the tax receivable agreement would be effectively accelerated in the event of an early termination of the tax receivable agreement by our intermediate holding companies or in the event of certain mergers asset sales and other forms of business combinations or other changes of control in these situations our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity         payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based upon the tax reporting positions that our managing partner will determine we are not aware of any issue that would cause the irs to challenge a tax basis increase however neither kkr holdings nor its transferees will reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis increase or the tax benefits we claim arising from such increase is successfully challenged by the irs as a result in certain circumstances payments to kkr holdings or its transferees under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the intermediate holding companies cash tax savings the intermediate holding companies ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase and the payments to be made under this agreement will depend upon a number of factors as discussed above including the timing and amount of our future income if we were deemed to be an investment company subject to regulation under the investment company act applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business         a person will generally be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the investment company act if  it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities or  absent an applicable exemption it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding  of the value of its total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis  table of contents         we believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing investment management services and not in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities we regard ourselves as an investment management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities accordingly we do not believe that we are an orthodox investment company as defined in section aa of the investment company act and described in the first bullet point above         with regard to the provision described in the second bullet point above we have no material assets other than our equity interests in subsidiaries which in turn have no material assets other than equity interests directly or indirectly in the kkr group partnerships through these interests we indirectly are the sole general partners of the kkr group partnerships and indirectly are vested with all management and control over the kkr group partnerships we do not believe our equity interests in our subsidiaries are investment securities and we believe that the capital interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities accordingly based on our determination less than  of the partnerships total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis are comprised of assets that could be considered investment securities however our subsidiaries have a significant number of investment securities and we expect to make investments in other investment securities from time to time we monitor these holdings regularly to confirm our continued compliance with the  test described in the second bullet point above the need to comply with this  test may cause us to restrict our business and subsidiaries with respect to the assets in which we can invest andor the types of securities we may issue sell investment securities including on unfavorable terms acquire assets or businesses that could change the nature of our business or potentially take other actions which may be viewed as adverse by the holders of our common units in order to ensure conformity with exceptions provided by and rules and regulations promulgated under the investment company act         the investment company act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies among other things the investment company act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act if anything were to happen which would cause the partnership to be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act requirements imposed by the investment company act including limitations on our capital structure ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees would make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted impair the agreements and arrangements between and among the partnership the kkr group partnerships and kkr holdings or any combination thereof and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal potentially divest of our investments or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the investment company act we are a delaware limited partnership and there are certain provisions in our limited partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the delaware general corporation law dgcl in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders         our limited partnership agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law our directors or officers will not be liable to us however under the dgcl a director or officer would be liable to us for i breach of duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders ii intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law that are not done in good faith iii improper redemption of shares or declaration of dividend or iv a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal  table of contents benefit in addition our limited partnership agreement provides that we indemnify our directors and officers for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law however under the dgcl a corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and in criminal action if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful accordingly our limited partnership agreement may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders when compared to the dgcl insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors see also our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties of our limited partner and limit remedies available for unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty it will be difficult for unitholders to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our managing partner or by its conflicts committee risks related to us taxation if we were treated as a corporation for us federal income tax or state tax purposes then our distributions to you would be substantially reduced and the value of our common units could be adversely affected         the value of your investment in us depends in part on our being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes which requires that  or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code and that our partnership not be registered under the investment company act qualifying income generally includes dividends interest capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities gain from the sale or other disposition of real property real property rents income and gains from energy and oil and gas investments and certain other forms of investment income we intend to structure our investments so as to satisfy these requirements including by generally holding investments that generate nonqualifying income through one or more subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes nonetheless we may not meet these requirements may not correctly identify investments that should be owned through corporate subsidiaries or current law may change so as to cause in any of these events us to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to us federal income tax we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs on this or any other matter affecting us         if we were treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes we would pay us federal state and local income tax on our taxable income at the applicable tax rates distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income gains losses deductions or credits would otherwise flow through to you because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation our distributions to you would be substantially reduced which could cause a reduction in the value of our common units         current law may change causing us to be treated as a corporation for us federal or state income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to entity level taxation see risks related to our businessthe us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as the market price of our units could be reduced several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income franchise or other forms of taxation if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity our distributions to you would be reduced  table of contents you will be subject to us federal income tax on your share of our taxable income regardless of whether you receive any cash distributions and may recognize income in excess of cash distributions         as long as  of our gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code and we are not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act on a continuing basis and assuming there is no change in law we will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation as a result a us unitholder will be subject to us federal state local and possibly in some cases foreign income taxation on its allocable share of our items of income gain loss deduction and credit including its allocable share of those items of any entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis for each of our taxable years ending with or within the unitholders taxable year regardless of whether or when such unitholder receives cash distributions see risks related to our businessthe us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as the market price of our units could be reduced         you may not receive cash distributions equal to your allocable share of our net taxable income or even the tax liability that results from that income in addition certain of our holdings including holdings if any in a controlled foreign corporation or a cfc a passive foreign investment company or a pfic or entities treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income and holders of our common units that are us taxpayers may be required to take such income into account in determining their taxable income in the event of an inadvertent termination of the partnership status for which the irs has granted limited relief each holder of our common units may be obligated to make such adjustments as the irs may require to maintain our status as a partnership such adjustments may require the holders of our common units to recognize additional amounts in income during the years in which they hold such units in addition because of our methods of allocating income and gain among holders of our common units you may be taxed on amounts that accrued economically before you became a unitholder for example phantom income from the portfolio or due to operational activities may arise during a month and be allocated to you creating taxable liability that kkr would not consider in a quarterly distribution because kkr typically considers tax distributions on an annual basis consequently you may recognize taxable income without receiving any cash         although we expect that distributions we make should be sufficient to cover a holders tax liability in any given year that is attributable to its investment in us no assurances can be made that this will be the case we will be under no obligation to make any such distribution and in certain circumstances may not be able to make any distributions or will only be able to make distributions in amounts less than a holders tax liability attributable to its investment in us in addition we anticipate making quarterly distributions but allocate taxable income on a monthly basis as a result if you dispose of your common units you may be allocated taxable income during the time you held your common units without receiving any cash distributions corresponding to that period accordingly each holder should ensure that it has sufficient cash flow from other sources to pay all tax liabilities our interests in certain of our businesses will be held through intermediate holding companies which will be treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes such corporations will be liable for significant taxes and may create other adverse tax consequences which could potentially adversely affect the value of our common units         in light of the publicly traded partnership rules under us federal income tax laws and other requirements we will hold our interest in certain of our businesses through intermediate holding  table of contents companies which will be treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes these intermediate holding companies will be liable for us federal income taxes at regular rates on all of their taxable income as well as applicable state local and other taxes these taxes would reduce the amount of distributions available to be made on our common units in addition these taxes could be increased if the irs were to successfully reallocate deductions or income of the related entities conducting our business changes in us tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors         under the us foreign account tax compliance act or fatca us withholding agents and all entities in a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions or ffis are required to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or beginning after june   be subject to a  united states withholding tax on certain us payments and beginning in  a  withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of us stocks and securities and nonus entities which are not ffis are required to either certify they have no substantial us beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial us beneficial ownership or beginning after june   be subject to a  us withholding tax on certain us payments and beginning in  a  withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of us stocks and securities the reporting obligations imposed under fatca require ffis to enter into agreements with the irs to obtain and disclose information about certain fund investors to the irs in addition the administrative and economic costs of compliance with fatca may discourage some foreign investors from investing in us funds which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors complying with certain taxrelated requirements may cause us to invest through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate income tax or enter into acquisitions borrowings financings or arrangements we may not have otherwise entered into         in order for us to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation we must meet the qualifying income exception discussed above on a continuing basis and we must not be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act in order to effect such treatment we or our subsidiaries may be required to invest through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate income tax or enter into acquisitions borrowings financings or other transactions we may not have otherwise entered into we may hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified as a pfic or cfc for us federal income tax purposes         certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes such an entity may be pfic for us federal income tax purposes in addition we may hold certain investments in foreign corporations that are treated as cfcs unitholders may experience adverse us tax consequences as a result of holding an indirect interest in a pfic or cfc these investments may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income and unitholders that are us taxpayers will be required to take such income into account in determining their gross income subject to tax in addition all or a portion of gain on the sale of a cfc may be taxable at ordinary income rates further with respect to gain on the sale of and excess distributions from a pfic for which an election for current inclusions is not made such income would be taxable at ordinary income rates and be subject to an additional tax charge equivalent to an interest charge on the deferral of income inclusions from that pfic  table of contents tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected         if you sell your common units you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your adjusted tax basis allocated to those common units prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to you will have decreased the tax basis in your common units therefore such excess distributions will increase your taxable gain or decrease your taxable loss when the common units are sold and may result in a taxable gain even if the sale price is less than the original cost a portion of the amount realized whether or not representing gain may be ordinary income to you unitholders may be allocated taxable gain on the disposition of certain assets even if they did not share in the economic appreciation inherent in such assets         we and our intermediate holding companies will be allocated taxable gains and losses recognized by the kkr group partnerships based upon our percentage ownership in each kkr group partnership our share of such taxable gains and losses generally will be allocated pro rata to our unitholders in some circumstances under the us federal income tax rules affecting partners and partnerships the taxable gain or loss allocated to a unitholder may not correspond to that unitholders share of the economic appreciation or depreciation in the particular asset this is primarily an issue of the timing of the payment of tax rather than a net increase in tax liability because the gain or loss allocation would generally be expected to be offset as a unitholder sold units nonus persons face unique us tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them         we expect that we will be engaged in a us trade or business for us federal income tax purposes including by reason of investments in us real property holding corporations real estate assets and energy assets in which case some portion of our income would be treated as effectively connected income with respect to nonus holders or eci to the extent our income is treated as eci nonus unitholders generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable share of such income would be required to file a us federal income tax return for such year reporting their allocable share of income effectively connected with such trade or business and any other income treated as eci and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular us tax rates on any such income state and local income taxes and filings may also apply in that event nonus unitholders that are corporations may also be subject to a  branch profits tax potentially reduced under an applicable treaty on their actual or deemed distributions of such income in addition distributions to nonus unitholders that are attributable to profits on the sale of a us real property interest may also be subject to  withholding tax also nonus unitholders may be subject to  withholding on allocations of our income that are us source fixed or determinable annual or periodic income under the internal revenue code unless an exemption from or a reduced rate of such withholding applies under an applicable treaty of the internal revenue code and certain tax status information is provided taxexempt entities face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them         generally a taxexempt partner of a partnership would be treated as earning unrelated business taxable income or ubti if the partnership regularly engages in a trade or business that is unrelated to the exempt function of the taxexempt partner if the partnership derives income from debtfinanced property or if the partner interest itself is debtfinanced as a result of our ownership of real estate assets and energy assets and incurrence of acquisition indebtedness we will derive income that constitutes ubti consequently a holder of common units that is a taxexempt entity including an individual retirement account or ira or a k plan participant will likely be subject to unrelated  table of contents business income tax to the extent that its allocable share of our income consists of ubti and thus may be subject to us federal income taxes and us federal income tax reporting with respect to such income in addition a taxexempt investor may be subject to unrelated business income tax on a sale of their common units we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and we will therefore adopt certain income tax accounting conventions that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax requirements the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of our common units         because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units we have adopted depreciation amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our unitholders tax returns         in addition our taxable income and losses are determined and apportioned among unitholders using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law as a result if you transfer your common units you may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer similarly a transferee may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of the transferees acquisition of our common units a transferee may also bear the cost of withholding tax imposed with respect to income allocated to a transferor through a reduction in the cash distributed to the transferee the sale or exchange of  or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for us federal income tax purposes         we will be considered to have been terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a month period a termination of our partnership would among other things result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders holders of our common units may be subject to state local and foreign taxes and return filing requirements as a result of owning such units         in addition to us federal income taxes holders of our common units may be subject to other taxes including state local and foreign taxes unincorporated business taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future even if the holders of our common units do not reside in any of those jurisdictions holders of our common units may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions in the us and abroad further holders of our common units may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all us federal state local and foreign tax returns that may be required of such unitholder in addition our investments in real assets may expose unitholders to additional adverse tax consequences see our investments in real assets such as real estate and energy may expose us to increased risks and liabilities and may expose our unitholders to adverse tax consequences  table

medicare tax we may not be able to furnish to each unitholder specific tax information within  days after the close of each calendar year which means that holders of common units who are us taxpayers

of income dividends gains losses or deductions and adjustments to carrying basis will be reported on schedule k and distributed to each unitholder annually it may require longer than  days after the

on march   to unitholders of record as of the close of business on february           we intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business and  of the net cash income from our realized principal investments in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations subject to the completion of the kfn merger we expect to maintain the same distribution policy except we intend to make quarterly cash distributions of  of kfns realized earnings and  of the net cash income from our other realized principal investments for purposes of our distribution policy distributions are expected to consist of i fre ii carry distributions received from our investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool and iii a percentage of net realized principal investment income as described above this amount is expected to be reduced by i corporate and applicable local taxes if any ii noncontrolling interests and iii amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above  table of contents         our distribution policy reflects our belief that distributing substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business will provide transparency for holders of our common units and impose on us an investment discipline with respect to the businesses and strategies that we pursue we believe distributing a meaningful portion of our net realized principal investment income allows the holders of our common units to participate in the returns generated on our balance sheet assets while still allowing us to retain significant capital to invest in our business         because we make our investment in our business through a holding company structure and the applicable holding companies do not own any material cashgenerating assets other than their direct and indirect holdings in kkr group partnership units distributions are expected to be funded in the following manner  first the kkr group partnerships will make distributions to holders of kkr group partnership units including the holding companies through which we invest in proportion to their percentage interests in the kkr group partnerships  second the holding companies through which we invest will distribute to us the amount of any distributions that they receive from the kkr group partnerships after deducting any applicable taxes and  third we will distribute to holders of our units the amount of any distributions that we receive from our holding companies through which we invest         the partnership agreements of the kkr group partnerships provide for cash distributions which are referred to as tax distributions to the partners of such partnerships if we determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners we expect that the kkr group partnerships would make tax distributions only to the extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities which would generally be computed based on an estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income however in light of our current distribution policy we expect that the kkr group partnerships will not make tax distributions because our distributions paid under our current policy are generally expected to be sufficient to permit us holders of kkr group partnership units to fund their estimated us tax obligations including any federal state and local income taxes with respect to their distributive shares of net income or gain after taking into account any withholding tax imposed on us there can be no assurance that for any particular holder such distributions will be sufficient to pay such holders actual us or nonus tax liability         the declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of our managing partner and the terms of our limited partnership agreement there can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that such distributions will be sufficient to pay any particular kkr  co lp unitholders actual us or nonus tax liability in particular the amount and timing of distributions will depend upon a number of factors including among others our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs including funding of investment commitments and debt service and future debt repayment obligations general economic and business conditions our strategic plans and prospects our results of operations and financial condition our capital requirements legal contractual and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions by us or our subsidiaries including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and such other factors as the board of directors of our managing partner considers relevant         the managing partner may change the distribution policy at any time and from time to time we are not currently restricted by any contract from making distributions to our unitholders although  table of contents certain of our subsidiaries are bound by credit agreements that contain certain restricted payment andor other covenants which may have the effect of limiting the amount of distributions that we receive from our subsidiaries see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

of our business including seed capital for new strategies and other opportunistic investments we believe that the market experience and skills of professionals in our capital markets business and the investment expertise of professionals in our private markets and public markets segments will allow us to continue to grow and diversify this asset base over time business environment         as a global investment firm we are affected by financial and economic conditions in north america europe asiapacific and elsewhere in the world global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations impacting both the success of the investments we make as well as our ability to exit these investments profitably and to make new investments while certain economies experienced moderate expansion in  the current global economic environment remains uncertain within europe there is a divergence between stronger growth in germany and weaker or negative growth in other countries overall europe has experienced negative growth trends as sovereign debt concerns have affected consumer and business behavior which has pushed the region into recession fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of european countries have led to substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs stresses in the european banking system and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area through the course of  fiscal restraint deficit reductions and central bank support have alleviated some of the stresses and borrowing costs have receded however these issues may resurface if there is not continual progress in structural reforms fiscal consolidation and other matters ongoing austerity and deleveraging in the developed world are likely to persist in the nearterm but at a slower pace importantly periods of deleveraging tend to be accompanied by increased volatility in the global capital markets which may pose downside risk to the economic outlook while a number of policy actions have been taken which seek to address the european sovereign debt crisis if one or more eurozone members were to leave the eurozone the functioning of europes single market currency could be undermined which would cause a deeper and more damaging impact on the global economy growth in asian economies is mixed for example the rate of real gross domestic product growth in china remains lower compared to the pace of growth in prior years in addition the new chinese leadership has signaled that its reform agenda is more important than growth and regulatory and structural adjustments could further impair growth the us economy grew moderately in  but continues to be restrained by various headwinds for example while unemployment has declined the unemployment rate remains elevated and consumer and business spending has been cautious in the wake of recent fiscal tightening in the us including the temporary us government shutdown us consumers could further retrench spending and while central banks around the world adopt quantitative easing the us dollar could continue to appreciate which could impact us corporate profitability as well as curtail us growth the us federal reserve has also announced a shift in monetary policy by initiating the tapering of quantitative easing uncertainty surrounding the pace and timing of tapering could cause interest rates to rise which could affect our investments         in addition foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and rising us interest rates may negatively impact certain foreign currencies that depend upon foreign capital flows for example the japanese yen indian rupee and australian dollar depreciated   and  against the us dollar respectively in  furthermore higher interest rates and weaker currencies in some emerging market currencies may increase country default risk within credit markets spreads have tightened significantly while issuance has reached record levels in  if interest rates rise sharply or growth remains weak default risk may rise moreover while our private markets business invested or committed over  table of contents  billion in new transaction activity during  through february   levels of transaction activity are generally volatile and reduced levels of transaction activity tend to result in a reduced amount of transaction fees and potential future investment gains         in addition to economic conditions global equity markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations as equity prices which have been and may continue to be volatile significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and therefore the investment income that we recognize for our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation for other investments these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize a market multiples valuation approach as one of the methodologies to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices in addition the receptivity of equity markets to initial public offerings or ipos as well as subsequent equity offerings by companies already public impacts our ability to realize investment gains for example during the first quarter of  we have been able to complete an ipo for santander consumer usa nyse sc and complete secondary sales of common shares of kion group ag xetra kgx prosiebensat media ag xetra psm and nxp semiconductors nv nasdaq nxpi         notwithstanding the trends described above global equity markets rose during the year ended december   with the sp  index up  and the msci world index up  equity market volatility declined during the year ended december   as evidenced by the chicago board options exchange market volatility index or the vix a measure of volatility beginning the year at  and ending at  on december   the belowinvestment grade credit markets trailed the equity markets with the splsta leveraged loan index up  and the boaml hy master ii index up  during the year ended december   respectively         conditions in global credit markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations we rely on the ability of our funds to obtain committed debt financing on favorable terms in order to complete new private equity and other transactions similarly our portfolio companies regularly require access to the global credit markets in order to obtain financing for their operations and to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness to the extent that conditions in the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive this may negatively impact the operating performance and valuations of those portfolio companies and therefore our investment returns on our funds in addition during economic downturns or periods of slow economic growth the inability to refinance or extend the maturities of portfolio company debt and thereby extend our investment holding period may hinder our ability to realize investment gains from these portfolio companies when economic conditions improve credit markets can also impact valuations for example we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices if applicable interest rates rise as was the case in  then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors conversely a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors these impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates in certain cases the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use the market multiples approach may yield different and offsetting results for example the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price finally low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases  table of contents         our public markets segment manages a number of funds and other accounts that invest capital in a variety of credit and equity strategies including leveraged loans high yield bonds and mezzanine debt as a result conditions in global credit and equity markets have a direct impact on both the performance of these investments as well as the ability to make additional investments on favorable terms in the future         in addition our capital markets and principal activities segment generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt securities and credit facilities with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes as a result the conditions in global equity and credit markets as well as transaction activity in our private markets segment and to a lesser extent public markets segment impact both the frequency and size of fees generated by this segment         finally conditions in commodity markets impact the performance of our portfolio companies in a variety of ways including through the direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell the price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility which among other things could be driven by economic monetary political or weather related factors if certain of our portfolio companies are unable to raise prices to offset increases in the cost of raw materials or other inputs or if consumers defer purchases of or seek substitutes for the products of such portfolio companies such portfolio companies could experience lower operating income which may in turn reduce the valuation of those portfolio companies however the results of operations and valuations of certain of our other portfolio companies for example those involved in the development of oil and natural gas properties may benefit from an increase or suffer from a decline in commodity prices in particular our private markets portfolio contains several real asset investments whose values are influenced by the price of natural gas and oil while nearterm natural gas and oil prices rose during the year ended december   longterm pricing of such real assets was by comparison more stable the valuations of these real asset investments generally increase or decrease with the increase or decrease respectively of such longterm commodities prices as well as individual company performance furthermore as we make additional investments in oil and gas companies and assets the value of our portfolio may become increasingly sensitive to oil and gas prices basis of accounting         the consolidated financial statements referred to hereafter as our financial statements include the accounts of kkrs management and capital markets companies the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities         in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap certain entities including a substantial number of our funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest or noneconomic variable interest in those entities in particular the majority of our consolidated funds consist of funds in which we hold a general partner or managing member interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds with respect to our consolidated funds and vehicles we generally have operational discretion and control and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund including the ability to remove the general partner also known as kickout rights as of december   our private markets segment included  consolidated investment funds and  unconsolidated coinvestment vehicles our public markets segment included  consolidated investment vehicles and  unconsolidated vehicles  table of contents         when an entity is consolidated we reflect the assets liabilities fees expenses investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis while the consolidation of a consolidated fund does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to kkr or kkrs partners capital that kkr reports the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation this is due to the fact that the assets liabilities fees expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected as single line items the single line items in which the assets liabilities fees expenses and investment income attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations for a further discussion of our consolidation policies see critical accounting policiesconsolidation key financial measures fees         fees consist primarily of i transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities ii management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds a specialty finance company structured finance and other vehicles and separately managed accounts iii monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies and iv consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing advisory and other services these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees upon closing of the transaction monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes         fees reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds because those fees are eliminated in consolidation however because those management fees are earned from and funded by thirdparty investors in our funds who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds net income attributable to kkr is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation accordingly while the consolidation of funds impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to kkr or kkrs partners capital         for a further discussion of our fee policies see critical accounting policiesrevenue recognition expenses compensation and benefits         compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries bonuses and benefits as well as equitybased compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equitybased awards and carry pool allocations         all kkr principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by kkr or its consolidated entities and is accounted for as compensation and benefits expense these employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance overall profitability and other matters while cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by kkr and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense cash bonuses that are paid to certain of kkrs principals are currently borne by kkr holdings these bonuses are  table of contents funded with distributions that kkr holdings receives on kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of kkr holdings because kkr principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principals vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense these compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by kkr holdings at the time of the distribution         with respect to kkrs active and future funds and coinvestment vehicles that provide for carried interest kkr allocates to its principals and other professionals a portion of the carried interest earned as part of its carry pool kkr currently allocates approximately  of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool for the purpose of the discussion under consolidated results of operations these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profitsharing arrangements in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as compensation and benefits expense for kkr employees and general administrative and other expense for certain nonemployee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations however for the purposes of the discussion under segment analysis carry pool allocations are recorded as a component of investment income loss general administrative and other         general administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors accountants advisors and consultants insurance costs travel and related expenses communications and information services depreciation and amortization charges changes in fair value of contingent consideration and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds general administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors investment income loss net gains losses from investment activities         net gains losses from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities the majority of our net gains losses from investment activities are related to our private equity investments fluctuations in net gains losses from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments the fair value of as well as the ability to recognize gains from our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets which in turn affects the net gains losses from investment activities recognized in any given period upon the disposition of an investment previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period since our investments are carried at fair value fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time for a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments see critical accounting policiesfair value measurements dividend income         dividend income consists primarily of distributions that investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with i dispositions of operations by portfolio companies ii distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and iii other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies  table of contents interest income         interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances principal assets and credit instruments in which our consolidated funds invest interest expense         interest expense is incurred from debt issued by kkr credit facilities entered into by kkr and debt outstanding at our consolidated funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or managing cash flow which are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of our consolidated funds or management companies in addition to these interest costs we capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straightline method as appropriate see liquidity income taxes         the kkr group partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the united states as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in nonus jurisdictions accordingly these entities in some cases are subject to new york city unincorporated business taxes or nonus income taxes furthermore we hold our interest in one of the kkr group partnerships through kkr management holdings corp which is treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and certain other whollyowned subsidiaries of the kkr group partnerships are treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes accordingly such whollyowned subsidiaries of kkr including kkr management holdings corp and of the kkr group partnerships are subject to federal state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to kkrs share of this income is reflected in the financial statements we also generate certain interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to kkr management holdings corp as a result of a  recapitalization of kkr management holdings corp         we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with gaap under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized         tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests         net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships that are held by kkr holdings the allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests historically the amount of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships held by kkr holdings we expect this activity to continue  table of contents segment operating and performance measures         the segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of each of kkrs reportable business segments the reportable segments for kkrs business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income loss between kkr  co lp and kkr holdings lp and as such represent the business in total in addition kkrs reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds that kkr manages         certain of the following financial measures in this report are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with gaap we believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our gaap results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of kkrs businesses these financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap if available we caution readers that these nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers and as a result may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap where applicable are included within financial statements and supplementary datanote  segment reporting and later in this report under segment book value fee related earnings fre         fee related earnings is comprised of segment fees less segment expenses other than certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income this measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of kkr and its business segments before investment income we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses the components of fre on a segment basis differ from the equivalent gaap amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of i the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation ii the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities iii the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets iv the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations v the exclusion of noncash equity charges and other noncash compensation charges borne by kkr holdings or incurred under the kkr  co lp  equity incentive plan equity incentive plan vi the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses and vii the exclusion of certain nonrecurring items economic net income loss eni         economic net income loss is a measure of profitability for kkrs reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative

of kkrs businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest eni is comprised of i fre plus ii segment investment income loss which is reduced for carry pool allocations management fee refunds interest expense and certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income less iii certain economic interests in

relating to noncontrolling interests and iii the exclusion of income taxes  table of contents assets under management aum         assets under management represent the assets from which kkr is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkrs capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds kkr calculates the amount of aum as of any date as the sum of i the fair value of the investments of kkrs investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds ii the fair value of investments in kkrs coinvestment vehicles iii the net asset value of certain of kkrs credit products iv the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles and v the fair value of other assets managed by kkr kkrs definition of aum is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions fee paying aum fpaum         fee paying aum represents only those assets under management from which kkr receives fees we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees this relates to kkrs capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds for only those funds where kkr receives fees ie excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkrs fees and differs from aum in the following respects i assets from which kkr does not receive a fee are excluded ie assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest and ii certain assets primarily in its private equity funds are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments committed dollars invested         committed dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital commitments that have been invested by kkrs investment funds and carryyielding coinvestment vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr and its business segments during a given period we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkrs investment of committed capital such amounts include i capital invested by fund investors and coinvestors with respect to which kkr is entitled to a carried interest and ii capital invested by kkrs investment funds and vehicles gross dollars invested         gross dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital that has been invested by all of our public markets investment vehicles in our private credit nonliquid strategies and is used as a measure of investment activity for our public markets in a given period we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into our public markets investment of capital across its private credit nonliquid strategies for all the investment vehicles which it manages such amounts include i capital invested by fund investors and coinvestors with respect to which our public markets segment is entitled to a fee or carried interest and ii internal and proprietary capital invested by our public markets investment funds and vehicles  table of contents syndicated capital         syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by kkr investment funds and carryyielding coinvestment vehicles which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee it does not include i capital invested in such transactions by kkr investment funds and carryyielding coinvestment vehicles which is instead reported in committed dollars invested and ii debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by kkr investment funds syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr and its business segments during a given period and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in kkrs capital markets and principal activities segment and across its investment platform uncalled commitments         uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that kkrs investment funds and carrypaying coinvestment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to kkrs investment funds and vehicles to make future investments adjusted units         adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of kkr that is held by kkr  co lp and kkr holdings and represent the fully diluted unit count using the ifconverted method we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of kkr as if all outstanding kkr holdings units had been exchanged for common units of kkr  co lp book value         book value is a measure of the net assets of kkrs reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of our investment portfolio including carried interest as well as our overall liquidity position we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of kkr excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders in our consolidated funds book value differs from kkr  co lp partners capital on a gaap basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to kkr holdings lp cash and shortterm investments         cash and shortterm investments represent cash and liquid shortterm investments in highgrade shortduration cash management strategies used by kkr to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating kkrs liquidity position we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkrs available liquidity cash and shortterm investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid shortterm investments in cash and shortterm investments the impact that these liquid shortterm investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities accordingly the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis has no impact on cash provided used by operating activities investing activities or financing activities as of december   we had cash and shortterm investments on a segment basis of approximately  billion excluding approximately  billion of liquid shortterm investments cash and shortterm investments may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of approximately  billion as of december    table of contents consolidated results of operations         the following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended

increase of  million compared to fees of  million for the year ended december   the net increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees of  million an increase in transaction fees of  million and an increase in incentive fees of  million the increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of prisma as well as new capital raised primarily in our public markets segment the increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an increase in the size and number of feegenerating investments completed during the year ended december   in our private markets segment during the year ended december   there were  transaction feegenerating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately  billion compared to  transaction feegenerating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately  billion during the year ended december   transaction fees vary by  table of contents investment based upon a number of factors the most significant of which are transaction size the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees the complexity of the transaction and kkrs role in the transaction the increase in incentive fees is due primarily to an increase in incentive fees received from prisma which became part of kkr during the three months ended december   partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from kfn as a result of its investment performance kfn has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and kkrs receipt of incentive fees from kfn incentive fees from kfn are determined quarterly while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelvemonth periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year due to the scheduled payments of such fees incentive fees can generally be expected to be larger in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter assuming performance thresholds have been met whether an incentive fee from kfn and other kkr vehicles is payable in any given period and the amount of an incentive fee payment if any depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period expenses         expenses were  million for the year ended december   an increase of  million compared to  million for the year ended december   the increase was primarily due to an increase in general administrative and other expenses of  million partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expenses of  million the increase in other general administrative and other expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees in connection with the growth of our business the acquisition of prisma as well as a  million onetime expense incurred in our public markets business in connection with the launch of a closedend fund during the year ended december   the net decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to i lower equitybased compensation reflecting fewer kkr holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition partially offset by ii an increase in cashbased compensation as a result of the prisma acquisition increased headcount and an increase in fees and iii higher equitybased compensation relating to additional equity grants under the equity incentive plan net gains losses from investment activities         net

that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in june  the decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies dividend income         dividend income was  million for the year ended december   a decrease of  million compared to dividend income of  million for the year ended december   during the year ended december   we received dividends of  million from capsugel healthcare sector  million from pets at home consumer products sector  million from visma technology sector  million

to year ended december   fees         fees were  million for the year ended december   a decrease of  million compared to fees of  million for the year ended december   the net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in transaction fees of  million and a decrease in monitoring fees of  million which were partially offset by a  million increase in management fees the decrease in transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of investments completed in our private markets segment and to a lesser extent a decrease in overall capital markets transaction activity in our private markets segment during  there were  transaction feegenerating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately  billion as compared to  transaction feegenerating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately  billion during  transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors the most significant of which are transaction size the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees the complexity of the transaction and kkrs role in the transaction in our capital markets business the transaction fees we receive will depend on the amount of capital our funds and other vehicles deploy the amount of capital this business syndicates and the number of transactions it completes for third party clients the decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of  million of fees received in  from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the ipos of hca inc and the nielsen company bv nyse nlsn and the sale of seven media group media sector while no such termination payments were received in  these types of termination payments may occur in the future however they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with ipo or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio also contributing to the decrease in monitoring fees was a decrease in expense reimbursements in connection with monitoring of portfolio companies of  million the decrease in monitoring fees from termination payments and expense reimbursements was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of  million the increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and an increase in the average size of the fee during the year ended december   we had  portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of  million compared with  portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of  million during the year ended december   the increase in management fees was primarily due to an increase relating to the acquisition of prisma as well as increases relating to new capital raised primarily in our public markets segment  table of contents expenses         expenses were  billion for the year ended december   an increase of  billion compared to  billion for the year ended december   the increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in compensation and benefits of  billion due to i higher carried interest being allocated to the carry pool for

increase of  million compared to fees of  million for the year ended december   the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of  million and an increase in incentive fees of  million the increase in management fees is due primarily to a full year of results for prisma being reflected in  the impact of our investment in nephila which was made during  and new capital raised the increase in incentive fees is due primarily to i an increase in incentive fees received from prisma which became part of kkr during the three months ended december   ii incentive fees relating to our investment in nephila and iii incentive fees from our kkr equity strategies platform these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from kfn as a result of its investment performance kfn has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and kkrs receipt of incentive fees from kfn incentive fees from kfn are determined quarterly while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelvemonth periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year due to the scheduled payments of such fees incentive fees can generally be expected to be larger in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter assuming performance thresholds have been met whether an incentive fee from kfn and other kkr vehicles is payable in any given period and the amount of an incentive fee payment if any depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period         on december   we certain of our affiliates and kfn entered into a merger

where fair value is below cost the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a netting hole when netting holes are present realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole once netting holes have been filled with either a return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or b increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event a fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next realization event which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest         as of december   netting holes existed at certain of our private equity funds the most significant of which were our domestic millennium fund partnership and domestic  fund partnership which had netting holes of approximately  million and  million respectively the domestic millennium fund partnership is not in position to pay cash carry however subsequent to december   we exited a portion of our investment in santander consumer usa pro forma for this event the netting hole in our domestic  fund partnership was reduced to zero and consequently this fund is in position to pay cash carry upon a profitable realization event however in  table of contents

in its discretion from time to time prisma capital partners         on october   kkr acquired all of the equity interests of prisma kkr may become obligated to make future purchase price payments in

acquisition of kfn         on december   kkr affiliates of kkr and kfn entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which kfn would become a subsidiary of kkr fund

completion of the merger is subject to various conditions         at the effective time of the merger each common share of kfn issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time excluding any common shares held by kkr fund holdings or any of its subsidiaries will be converted into the right to receive  kkr common units together with cash in lieu of fractional units tax receivable agreement         we and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for us federal state and local income tax purposes may be required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings kkr management holdings lp made an election under section  of the internal revenue code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of kkr group partnership units for common units occurs which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies share of the tax basis of the assets of the kkr group partnerships at the time of an exchange of kkr group partnership units certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available this increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain or increase loss on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets         we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to kkr holdings or to executives who have exchanged kkr holdings units for kkr common units as transferees of kkr group partnership units  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above as well as  of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement a termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events in the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire kkr group partnership units in the future or if we become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms         these payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the kkr group partnerships as such cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from  table of contents those received by current and former holders of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings and our current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within  days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by kkrs intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of kkr group partnership units         for the years ended december    and  cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were  million  million and  million respectively we expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining  of cash savings if any in income tax that they realize as of december    million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized distributions         in april  we amended our distribution policy to provide for the quarterly distribution of a percentage of net realized principal investment income as described below the distribution of net realized principal investment income replaces the annual additional distribution that was historically announced in connection with fourth quarter earnings this additional distribution was intended to cover certain tax liabilities as calculated by us and as a result of the change in distribution policy we expect that such additional distributions will no longer be made although the board of directors of the general partner of kkr  co lp may decide otherwise from time to time         we intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business and  of the net cash income from our realized principal investments in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations for purposes of our distribution policy distributions are expected to consist of i fre ii carry distributions received from our investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool and iii a percentage of net realized principal investment income this amount is expected to be reduced by i corporate and applicable local taxes if any ii noncontrolling interests and iii amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above         the declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of kkr  co lp which may change the distribution policy at any time and the terms of its limited partnership agreement there can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that unitholders will receive sufficient distributions to satisfy payment of their tax liabilities as limited partners of kkr  co lp when kkr  co lp

who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally guaranteed on a several basis and subject to a cap the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners clawback obligations the terms of the kpe transaction require that our

consolidated entities which in particular include our consolidated funds notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds the assets of our consolidated funds on a gross basis are substantially larger than the assets of our business and accordingly have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows the primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve i capital contributions from fund investors ii using the capital of fund investors to make investments iii financing certain investments with indebtedness iv generating cash flows through the realization of investments and v distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors because our consolidated funds are

consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of fees expenses and investment income our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances however these estimates judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses if actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated judged or assumed revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates judgments or assumptions please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies principles of consolidation         our policy is to consolidate i those entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over significant operating financial and investing decisions of the entity including those private equity credit and other investment funds and their respective consolidated funds in which the general partner is presumed to have control or ii entities determined to be variable interest entities vies for which we are considered the primary beneficiary         with respect to the consolidated kkr funds we generally have operational discretion and control and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund including the ability to remove the general partner also known as kickout rights         the consolidated kkr funds do not consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies rather those investments are accounted for as investments and carried at fair value as described below         the kkr funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds the consolidated financial statements reflect the assets liabilities revenues expenses investment income and cash flows of the consolidated kkr funds on a gross basis and the majority of the economic interests in those funds which are held by third party investors in our funds are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for funds that are consolidated all investment income loss including the portion of a funds investment income loss that is allocable to kkrs carried interest is included in investment income loss on the consolidated statements of operations the carried interest that kkr retains in net income loss attributable to kkr  co lp is reflected as an adjustment to net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests all of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by us from those funds are eliminated in consolidation however because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by noncontrolling interests our attributable share of the net income from those  table of contents funds is increased by the amounts eliminated accordingly the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income loss attributable to us or our partners capital         noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interests held by entities or persons other than us investments         investments consist primarily of private equity real assets credit equity method and other investments investments are carried at their estimated fair values with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of net gains losses from investment activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations investments denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period with changes related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of net gains losses from investment activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis further disclosure on investments is presented in note  investments in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report         the following describes the types of securities held within each investment class         private equity consists primarily of equity investments in operating companies         real assets consists primarily of investments in i oil and natural gas properties energy ii infrastructure assets and iii residential and commercial real estate assets and businesses real estate         credit consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in collateralized loan obligations         equity method consists primarily of investments in unconsolidated investment funds and vehicles that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of earnings losses from equity method investments is reflected as a component of net gains losses from investment activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment funds and vehicles are reported at fair value the carrying value of our equity method investments representing kkrs interests in unconsolidated funds approximates fair value         other consists primarily of investments in common stock preferred stock warrants and options of companies that are not private equity real assets credit or equity method investments fair value measurements         investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value the majority of investments and other financial instruments are held by the consolidated funds our funds and vehicles are for gaap purposes investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value we have retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated funds and vehicles in consolidation accordingly the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held by our funds and vehicles are reflected as a component of net gains losses from investment activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations         for investments and other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated fund or vehicle we have elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial instruments are similar to those in the consolidated funds and vehicles such election is irrevocable and is applied on  table of contents an investment by investment basis at initial recognition unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of net gains losses from investment activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations the methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated funds and vehicles         the carrying amounts of other assets accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities recognized on the statements of financial condition excluding fixed assets goodwill intangible assets contingent consideration and certain debt obligations approximate fair value due to their short term maturities these items are presented in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report specifically information on goodwill and intangible assets is presented in note  goodwill and intangible assets and information on contingent consideration is presented in note  acquisitions our debt obligations except for our  and  senior notes bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value further information on our  and  senior notes are presented in note  debt obligations the fair value for our  and  senior notes were derived using level ii inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments         fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date where available fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters where observable prices or inputs are not available valuation techniques are applied these valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors see note  fair value measurements for further information on our valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value hierarchical levels as defined under gaap are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities the hierarchical levels defined under gaap are as follows level i         inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date the type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publiclylisted equities and debt and securities sold short we classified  of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level i at december   level ii         inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level ii inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability the type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are credit investments convertible debt securities indexed to publiclylisted securities and certain overthecounter derivatives we classified  of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level ii at december   level iii         inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability the types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist we classified  of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level iii at december   the valuation of our level iii investments at  table of contents december   represents managements best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date         in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset         a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly in those circumstances further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value         the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors including for example the type of instrument whether the instrument has recently been issued whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and current market conditions to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level iii the variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between levels i ii and iii which we recognize at the beginning of the reporting period         investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices such as those traded on a securities exchange are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date we do not adjust the quoted price for these investments even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price level ii valuation methodologies         financial assets and liabilities categorized as level ii consist primarily of securities indexed to publiclylisted securities and credit and other investments credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace bid prices reflect the highest price that kkr and others are willing to pay for an asset ask prices represent the lowest price that kkr and others are willing to accept for an asset for financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bidask prices obtained from third party pricing services fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bidask range our policy is generally to allow for midmarket pricing and adjusting to the point within the bidask range that meets our best estimate of fair value for securities indexed to publicly listed securities such as convertible debt the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models the key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed to the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publiclytraded the implied credit spread on the companys other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation to the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publiclytraded the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publiclytraded debt securities in certain cases an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publiclytraded the volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible andor the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security  table of contents level iii valuation methodologies         managements determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are managements best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors         financial assets and liabilities categorized as level iii consist primarily of the following         private equity investments     we generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment the first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures the second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values such as exit ebitda multiples other inputs are also used in both methodologies for valuations determined for periods other than at year end various inputs may be estimated prior to the end of the relevant period also as discussed in greater detail under business environment a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations in certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates         upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies a weighting is ascribed to each method and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate the ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies         when determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology we consider among other factors the availability of direct market comparables the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment these factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a  weighting to a single methodology across the level iii private equity investment portfolio approximately  of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly  on market comparables and  on a discounted cash flow analysis less than  of the fair value of the level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based  on market comparables or  on a discounted cash flow analysis as of december   the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology for our level iii private equity investments were  and  respectively as of december   we believe that the approach of using both the market multiples methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology resulted in valuations of our aggregate level iii private equity portfolio that were only marginally higher than if only the discounted cash flow methodology had been used and that were only marginally lower than if only the market comparables methodology had been used         when determining the illiquidity discount to be applied we seek to take a uniform approach across our portfolio and generally apply a minimum  discount to all private equity investments we then evaluate such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and therefore justify applying a higher illiquidity discount these factors generally include i whether we are unable to sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent rights of a third party or similar factors ii whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and iii characteristics about the portfolio company regarding its size andor whether the portfolio company is experiencing or expected to experience a significant decline in earnings these factors generally make it less likely that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples andor discounted cash flow analysis and these factors tend to reduce the number of opportunities to sell an investment andor increase the  table of contents time horizon over which an investment may be monetized depending on the applicability of these factors we determine the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the  minimum and during the time we hold the investment the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased from time to time based on changes to these factors the amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment accordingly the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by us in our valuations         real assets investments     for energy and infrastructure investments we generally utilize a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values such as exit ebitda multiples for real estate investments we generally utilize a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments estimates of key inputs used in these methodologies include an unlevered discount rate and terminal capitalization rate the valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs certain investments in real estate and energy generally do not include a minimum illiquidity discount         credit investments     credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers and where these values are not available credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of values determined by an independent valuation firm valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers         other investments     we generally employ the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments         key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our level iii investment valuations as described above are included in note  fair value measurements we utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its level iii investments these unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or for applicable investments if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies level iii valuation process         the valuation process involved for level iii measurements for private equity real assets credit and other investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency oversight and review we have a private markets valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit and other investments the private markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of real estate investments each of the private markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team which except as noted below is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued the valuation teams for energy infrastructure and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments the valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing our quarterly valuation policies guidelines and processes for private markets investments classified as level iii investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial  table of contents and operating data company specific developments market valuations of comparable companies and other factors these preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations for all level iii investments in private markets except for certain investments other than our private equity investments for most investments classified as level iii in public markets an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by us to provide third party valuations or ranges of valuations from which our investment professionals select a preliminary valuation or a third party firm is generally engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations all preliminary valuations in private markets and public markets are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees the preliminary valuations are presented to a single committee consisting of senior principals involved in various aspects of the our business when these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it the valuations of level iii investments as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments are presented to the audit committee of our board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors         as of december   upon completion by an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values as determined by kkr of private markets investments reviewed by them were reasonable the limited procedures did not involve an audit review compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on certain level iii credit investments we are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments         as described above level ii and level iii investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed additional external factors may cause those values and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist to increase or decrease over time which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners capital that we report from time to time         changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains losses from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under key financial measuresinvestment income lossnet gains losses from investment activities based on the investments of our private equity funds as of december   we estimate that an immediate  decrease in the fair value of the funds investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains losses from investment activities except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr would generally be significantly less than the amount described above given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments         as of december   private equity investments which represented greater than  of consolidated investments consisted of alliance boots gmbh valued at  billion on a segment basis as of december   investments which represented greater than  of total reportable segments investments consisted of alliance boots gmbh hca inc and first data corporation valued at  million  million and  million respectively  table of contents revenue recognition         fees consist primarily of i transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities ii management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds a specialty finance company structured finance and other vehicles and separately managed accounts iii monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies and iv consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing advisory and other services these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees upon closing of the transaction monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes         certain of kkrs private equity funds require the management company to refund up to  of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a carried interest at such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover  of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof a liability to the funds limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized not to exceed  of the cash management fees earned as of december   there is no carried interest subject to management fee refunds which may reduce carried interest in future periods the refunds to the limited partners are paid and the liabilities relieved at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized in the event that a funds carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents  of the cash management fees earned these fees would not be returned to the funds limited partners in accordance with the respective fund agreements recognition of investment income         investment income consists primarily of the net impact of i realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments ii dividends iii interest income iv interest expense and v foreign exchange gains and losses relating to marktomarket activity on foreign exchange forward contracts foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt unrealized gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in net gains losses from investment activities upon disposition of an investment previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized while this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains losses that we recognize from investment activities it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes         due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds the portion of our funds investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements for funds that are consolidated all investment income loss including the portion of a funds investment income loss that is allocable to kkrs carried interest is included in investment income loss on the consolidated statements of operations the carried interest that kkr retains in net income loss attributable to kkr  co lp is reflected as an adjustment to net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds investments our share of the investment income generated by our funds investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements recognition of carried interest in statement of operations         carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the funds earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and  table of contents correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests attributable share of those earnings amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income loss in net gains losses from investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable preferred return thresholds have been met if these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains losses from investment activities         carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the funds investments were realized at the then estimated fair values amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable preferred return thresholds have been met if these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled a clawback obligation would be recorded for funds that are consolidated this clawback obligation if any is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition for funds that are not consolidated this clawback obligation if any is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded due to the extended durations of our private equity funds we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds clawback provision         the partnership documents governing our carrypaying funds including funds relating to private equity mezzanine infrastructure energy real estate direct lending and special situations investments generally include a clawback provision that if triggered may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund under a clawback obligation upon the liquidation of a carrypaying fund the general partner is required to return typically on an aftertax basis previously distributed carry to the extent that due to the diminished performance of later investments the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance hurdle         prior to the kpe transaction certain kkr principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to kkr had personally guaranteed on a several basis and subject to a cap the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners clawback obligations the terms of the kpe transaction require that kkr principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the kpe transaction up to a maximum of  million through investment realizations this amount has been reduced to  million as of december   carry distributions arising subsequent to the kpe transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to kkr and kkrs principals who participate in the carry pool net loss sharing provision         certain private equity funds that were contributed to kkr in the kpe transaction also include a net loss sharing provision upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle to fund  of the net losses on investments in these vehicles such losses would be required to be paid by kkr to fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any  table of contents carried interest had previously been distributed and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner unlike the clawback obligation kkr will be responsible for all amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify kkrs principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts recently issued accounting

iii introduces new disclosures this guidance is effective for kkrs fiscal year beginning january   earlier application is prohibited the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on kkrs financial results and consolidated financial statements item a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk         our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as general partner or manager of our funds and sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments including the effect that those movements have on our management fees carried interest and net gains from investment activities we have an increased exposure to market risks as a result of our principal assets the fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates         the quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate in order to provide a reader with an indication of the directional impact that a hypothetical adverse movement in certain risks would have on net income attributable to kkr  co lp the actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below         the firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks management of market risk         when we commit capital of a certain amount from our balance sheet to investments or transactions a balance sheet committee of senior employees including our two cochief executive officers the chief financial officer and chief administrative officer must approve the transaction before it may be made in addition this committee supervises activities governing kkrs capital structure liquidity and other strategies for the composition of our balance sheet         certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits regulatory capital requirements and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to brokerdealers pursuant to the securities exchange act of  when our capital is committed to capital markets transactions after diligence is conducted such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee these transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits the risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction for example and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of assets liabilities and certain offbalancesheet items aggregate balance sheet risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above         with respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors kkr manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee and then a portfolio management committee or other applicable senior employees regularly monitors these investments before making an investment investment professionals identify risks in due diligence evaluating among other things business financial legal  table of contents and regulatory issues financial data and other information an investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee which must approve each investment before it may be made if an investment is made a portfolio management committee or other applicable senior employees is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis management of general business risk         kkr has a risk committee comprised of senior employees from across our business segments and across business operations and includes our chief administrative officer our chief financial officer and our general counsel the risk committee monitors and evaluates kkrs general business risks the chief administrative officer who also serves as the chairman of the risk committee regularly reports to our cochief executive officers and quarterly to the audit committee which is the chief committee that monitors risk on behalf of the board of directors in addition in  we established a position dedicated to evaluating and monitoring market risk and coordinating such efforts across our businesses         kkrs global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in kkrs business including conflicts relating to specific transactions and circumstances as well as those implicit in the overall

valuation of our level iii investments in private and public markets market risk         the majority of our investments are reported at fair value net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains losses from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations based on the investments held as of december   we estimate that an immediate  decrease in the fair value of the investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains losses from investment activities except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr  co lp would generally be significantly less than the amount described above given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments and to a lesser extent our management fees because of this the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to kkr  co lp the actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of i the elimination of management fees and carried interest and ii the grossup of net gains losses from investment activities in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds         based on the fair value of investments as of december   we estimate that an immediate hypothetical  decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income  table of contents attributable to kkr  co lp in  from reductions in the following items if not offset by other factors     year ended december         management fees   carried interest net of carry pool allocation   net gains losses from investment activities excluding carried interest        in thousands    decline in fair value of investments             an immediate hypothetical  decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees since the majority of our incentive fees are earned at december  st of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback a  decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees were earned  represents an annualized reduction in management fees  decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter         our management fees in our private markets investment funds are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund as described under businessour segmentsprivate markets accordingly movements in the fair value of investments do not affect the amount of fees we may charge in these types of funds in the case of our public markets business management fees are often calculated based on the average nav of the fund vehicle or specialty finance company for that particular period although certain funds in our public markets segment have management fees based on the amount of capital committed or invested to the extent that management fees are calculated based on the nav of the funds investments the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the funds investments the proportion of our management fees that are based on nav depends on the number and type of funds in existence for the year ended december   the approximate percentage of our fund management fees based on the nav of the applicable funds or separately managed accounts are as follows     year ended december     fund management fees based on nav of the applicable funds       securities market risk         our investment funds and principal assets hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded the market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control these factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale general economic social or political developments industry conditions changes in government regulation shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts the general state of the securities markets and other material events such as significant management changes refinancings acquisitions and dispositions in addition although our investments are comprised primarily of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded the value of these  table of contents investments may also fluctuate due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded exchange rate risk         our investment funds and principal assets hold investments in currencies other than those in which their capital commitments are denominated those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the capital commitments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made additionally a portion of our management fees are denominated in nonus dollar currencies our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which their capital commitments are denominated         because most of the capital commitments to our funds and kkrs capital are denominated in us dollars our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated primarily euros british pounds and korean won net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to kkr  co lp the actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of i the elimination of management fees and carried interest and ii the grossup of net gains losses from investment activities in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds         we estimate that an immediate hypothetical  decline in the exchange rates between the us dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated as of december   would result in declines in net income attributable to kkr  co lp in  from reductions in the following items net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies if not offset by other factors     year ended december         management fees   carried interest net of carry pool allocation   net gains losses from investment activities excluding carried interest        in thousands    decline in foreign currencies against the us dollar             an immediate hypothetical  decline in exchange rates between the us dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would only marginally impact our ability to earn incentive fees since the majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in us dollars  represents an annualized reduction in management fees  decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter credit risk         we are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements in these agreements we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise  table of contents perform we generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions in addition availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events and we may not be able to access these financing markets interest rate risk         we and our consolidated funds have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements and certain investment financing arrangements structured through the use of term loans and revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates and changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that we would have to make impacting future earnings and cash flows based on our debt obligations payable at december   inclusive of debt obligations of our consolidated funds we estimate that interest expense relating to instruments bearing variable rates would increase on an annual basis by  million in the event interest rates were to increase by a hypothetical  basis points based on outstanding debt obligations at december   the estimated impact on interest expense is solely related to the debt obligations of our consolidated funds a substantial portion of which is attributable to noncontrolling interests  table of contents item     financial

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audits of the financial statements included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting

understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions         a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements         because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also

voting interest or has majority ownership and control over significant operating financial and investing decisions of the entity including the kkr funds and vehicles in which kkr as general partner is presumed to have control or ii entities determined to be variable interest entities vies for which kkr is considered the primary beneficiary         with respect to kkrs consolidated funds and vehicles kkr generally has operational discretion and control and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund including the ability to remove the general partner also known as kickout rights as a result a fund should be consolidated unless kkr has a nominal level of equity at risk to the extent that kkr commits a nominal amount of equity to a given fund and has no obligation to fund any future losses the equity at risk to kkr is not considered substantive and the fund is typically considered a vie as described below in these cases the fund investors are generally deemed to be the primary beneficiaries and kkr does not consolidate the fund in cases when kkrs equity at risk is deemed to be substantive the fund is generally not considered to be a vie and kkr generally consolidates the fund         kkrs funds are consolidated by kkr notwithstanding the fact that kkr has only a minority economic interest in those funds kkrs financial statements reflect the assets liabilities fees expenses investment income loss and cash flows of the consolidated kkr funds and vehicles on a gross basis and the majority of the economic interests in those funds which are held by fund investors are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying financial statements all of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by kkr from those funds are eliminated in consolidation however because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by noncontrolling interests kkrs attributable share of the net income loss from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated accordingly the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income loss attributable to kkr or kkr partners

eliminated variable interest entities         kkr consolidates all vies in which it is considered the primary beneficiary an enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest under gaap a controlling financial interest is defined as a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys business and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity the consolidation

the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests unrelated to the holding of equity interests would give it a controlling financial interest under gaap performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment where kkr has an interest in an entity that has qualified for the deferral of the consolidation rules the analysis is based on consolidation rules prior to january   these rules require an analysis to determine a whether an entity in which kkr has a variable interest is a vie and b whether kkrs involvement through the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests would be expected to absorb a majority of the variability of the entity under both guidelines kkr determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie at the time it becomes involved with a vie and reconsiders that conclusion at each reporting date in evaluating whether kkr is the primary beneficiary kkr evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly by kkr or indirectly through related parties the consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively however if it is not readily apparent that kkr is not the primary beneficiary a quantitative analysis may also be performed investments and redemptions either by kkr affiliates of kkr or third parties or amendments to the governing documents of the respective entities could affect an entitys status as a vie or the determination of the primary beneficiary at each reporting date kkr assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and will consolidate or not consolidate accordingly kkrs accounting conclusion under the existing consolidation rules determined that effective january   kkr became the primary beneficiary of certain entities and consolidated such entities that were unconsolidated prior to that date         as of december   and  the maximum exposure to loss before allocations to the carry pool if any for those vies in which kkr is determined not to be the primary beneficiary but in which it has a variable interest is as follows

provide any support other than its obligated amount         kkrs investment strategies differ by investment fund however the fundamental risks have similar characteristics including loss of invested

basis at initial recognition unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of net gains losses from investment activities in the consolidated statements

orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date where available fair value is  table of contents kkr  co lp notes to consolidated financial statements continued all dollars are in thousands except unit per unit data and except where noted  summary of significant accounting policies continued based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters where observable prices or inputs are not available valuation techniques are applied these valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors see note  fair value measurements for further information on kkrs valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value hierarchical levels as defined under gaap are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities the hierarchical levels defined under gaap are as follows level i         inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date the type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publiclylisted equities and debt and securities sold short level ii         inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level ii inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability the type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are credit investments convertible debt securities indexed to publiclylisted securities and certain overthecounter derivatives level iii         inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability the types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist         in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety kkrs assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset         a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly in those circumstances further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value         the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors including for example the type of instrument whether the instrument has recently been issued whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and current market conditions to the extent that valuation is based on models or  table of contents kkr  co lp notes to consolidated financial statements continued all dollars are in thousands except unit per unit data and except where noted  summary of significant accounting policies continued inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by kkr in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level iii the variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between levels i ii and iii which kkr recognizes at the beginning of the reporting period         investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices such as those traded on a securities exchange are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date kkr does not adjust the quoted price for these investments even in situations where kkr holds a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price         managements determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are managements best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors level ii valuation methodologies         financial assets and liabilities categorized as level ii consist primarily of securities indexed to publiclylisted securities and credit and other investments credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace bid prices reflect the highest price that kkr and others are willing to pay for an asset ask prices represent the lowest price that kkr and others are willing to accept for an asset for financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bidask prices obtained from third party pricing services fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bidask range kkrs policy is generally to allow for midmarket pricing and adjusting to the point within the bidask range that meets kkrs best estimate of fair value for securities indexed to publicly listed securities such as convertible debt the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models the key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed to the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publiclytraded the implied credit spread on the companys other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation to the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publiclytraded the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publiclytraded debt securities in certain cases an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publiclytraded the volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible andor the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security level iii valuation methodologies         financial assets and liabilities categorized as level iii consist primarily of the following         private equity investments     kkr generally employs two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment the first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures the second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used  table of contents kkr  co lp notes to consolidated financial statements continued all dollars are in thousands except unit per unit data and except where noted  summary of significant accounting policies continued to calculate terminal values such as exit ebitda multiples other inputs are also used in both methodologies         upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies a weighting is ascribed to each method and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate the ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies         when determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology kkr considers among other factors the availability of direct market comparables the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment these factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a  weighting to a single methodology across the level iii private equity investment portfolio approximately  of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly  on market comparables and  on a discounted cash flow analysis less than  of the fair value of the level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based  on market comparables or  on a discounted cash flow analysis         when determining the illiquidity discount to be applied kkr seeks to take a uniform approach across its portfolio and generally applies a minimum  discount to all private equity investments kkr then evaluates such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and therefore justify applying a higher illiquidity discount these factors generally include i whether kkr is unable to sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent rights of a third party or similar factors ii whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and iii characteristics about the portfolio company regarding its size andor whether the portfolio company is experiencing or expected to experience a significant decline in earnings these factors generally make it less likely that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples andor discounted cash flow analysis and these factors tend to reduce the number of opportunities to sell an investment andor increase the time horizon over which an investment may be monetized depending on the applicability of these factors kkr determines the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the  minimum and during the time kkr holds the investment the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased from time to time based on changes to these factors the amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment accordingly the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by kkr in its valuations         real assets investments     for energy and infrastructure investments kkr generally utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values such as exit ebitda multiples for real estate investments kkr generally utilizes a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments estimates of key inputs used in these methodologies include an unlevered discount rate and terminal capitalization rate the valuations  table of contents kkr  co lp notes to consolidated financial statements continued all dollars are in thousands except unit per unit data and except where noted  summary of significant accounting policies continued of real assets investments also use other inputs certain investments in real estate and energy generally do not include a minimum illiquidity discount         credit investments     credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers and where these values are not available credit investments are valued by kkr based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers         other investments     kkr generally employs the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments         key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on kkrs level iii investment valuations as described above are included in note  fair value measurements kkr utilizes several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its level iii investments these unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of kkrs valuation methodologies kkrs reported fair value estimates could vary materially if kkr had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or for applicable investments if kkr only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies level iii valuation process         the valuation process involved for level iii measurements for private equity real assets credit and other investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency oversight and review kkr has a private markets valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit and other investments the private markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of real estate investments each of the private markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team which except as noted below is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued the valuation teams for energy infrastructure and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments the valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing kkrs quarterly valuation policies guidelines and processes for private markets investments classified as level iii investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data company specific developments market valuations of comparable companies and other factors these preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by kkr to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkrs valuations for all level iii investments in private markets except for certain investments other than kkr private equity investments for most investments classified as level iii in public markets an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by kkr to provide third party valuations or ranges of valuations from which kkrs investment professionals select a preliminary valuation or a third party firm is generally engaged by kkr to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkrs valuations all  table of contents kkr  co lp notes to consolidated financial statements continued all dollars are in thousands except unit per unit data and except where noted  summary of significant accounting policies continued

preliminary valuations are presented to the management committee when these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it the valuations of level iii investments as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments are presented to the audit committee of kkrs board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors derivatives         derivative contracts include forward swap and option contracts related to foreign currencies and credit standing of reference entities to manage foreign exchange risk and credit risk arising from certain assets and liabilities all derivatives are recognized in other assets or accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities and are presented gross in the consolidated statements of financial condition

financial institutions with strong credit ratings securities sold short         whether part of a hedging transaction or a transaction in its own right securities sold short represent obligations of kkr to deliver the specified security at the contracted price at a future point in time and thereby create a liability to repurchase the security in the market at the prevailing prices the liability

dependent on kkr generating sufficient taxable income within the period of time that the tax benefits are expected to reverse kkr considers projections of taxable income in evaluating its ability to utilize those deferred tax assets in projecting its taxable income kkr begins with historical results and incorporates assumptions concerning the amount and timing of future pretax operating income those assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that kkr uses to manage its business at this time kkrs projection of future taxable income indicates that it is more likely than not that the benefits from the deferred tax assets will be realized therefore kkr has determined that no valuation allowance is needed at december   in addition because kkr has not recorded an operating loss since its inception kkr has not recorded a deferred tax asset for any federal or state net operating tax loss carry forwards         kkr files its tax returns as

the general partner of kkr holdings and is based on multiple factors primarily related to the award recipients individual performance         the fair value of principal awards is based on the closing price of kkr  co lp common units on the date of grant kkr determined this to be the best evidence of fair value as a kkr  co lp common unit is traded in an active market and has an observable market

required to file a form  to report previously unreported ownership or changes in ownership we believe that with respect to the fiscal year ended december   such persons complied with all such filing requirements item     executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy         our compensation program has three primary objectives  to attract motivate and retain our employees  to align their interests with those of our unitholders and fund investors and  to reinforce our culture and values         our employees     our business as an investment firm is dependent on the services of our principals including our named executive officers and other employees among other things we depend on their ability to find select and execute investments manage and improve portfolio company operations find and develop relationships with fund investors and other sources of capital and provide other services and we cannot compete without their continued employment with us therefore it is important that our key employees are compensated in a manner that motivates them to excel and encourages them to remain with the firm         alignment of interests     management equity ownership in the businesses in which we invest has been a guiding principle throughout our firms history and we apply that principle to ourselves every employee of the firm is expected to have an equity interest in us this equity ownership serves to align the interests of our employees with those of our unitholders in addition because we invest in and alongside our investment funds and have a carry pool from which we can allocate to our principals  of the carried interest that we generate through our business we believe that our principals interests are also aligned with those of our investors in the funds vehicles and accounts that we manage which in turn benefits our unitholders  table of contents         culture and values     one of our most important values is our onefirm approach with shared responsibility and success and we subscribe to a culture of meritocracy and fairness therefore compensation is based on the performance of the firm as a whole and on an individuals contributions to the firm for example we do not compensate people based merely on an individuals accomplishments in relation to the profits and losses of his or her business unit in addition we conduct at least annually an evaluation process that seeks input from a wide range of persons on an employees contribution to the firm including his or her commitment to the firms culture and values we believe that using this kind of an evaluation process also promotes a measure of objectivity as a balance to a single managers judgment         we refer to our two cochief executive officers our chief administrative officer our chief financial officer and our general counsel as our named executive officers we believe that the elements of compensation discussed below for our named executive officers serve these primary objectives we as a limited partnership with no annual meeting of unitholders are not required to conduct sayonpay or sayonfrequency votes as provided in the doddfrank act however we intend periodically to review the elements of our compensation and we may make changes to the compensation structure relating to one or more named executive officers based on the outcome of such reviews from time to time kkr holdings         each of our named executive officers holds interests in our business through kkr holdings which is the entity that indirectly owns all of the outstanding kkr group partnership units that are not allocable to us         kkr holdings units are subject to certain restrictions exchangeable for our common units on a oneforone basis and generally cannot be sold to third parties for monetary value unless they are first exchanged for our common units because kkr holdings units are exchangeable for our common units we believe that our named executive officers interests are aligned with those of our unitholders         kkr holdings from time to time receives distributions that are made on kkr group partnership units that are held by it to the extent such distributions are received on kkr group partnership units that underlie any kkr holdings units that have satisfied their respective servicebased vesting requirements if any at the time distributions are declared on the underlying kkr group partnership units such distributions will be allocated and further distributed to the named executive officers as and when received to the extent that such distributions are made on kkr group partnership units underlying any kkr holdings units that have not satisfied the servicebased vesting requirements at the time distributions are declared on the underlying kkr group partnership units such distributions may be allocated or otherwise applied in such amounts and in such manner as our cochief executive officers acting through the general partner of kkr holdings may determine servicebased vesting requirements are generally three to five years from the date of grant it is contemplated that such distributions with respect to unvested kkr holdings units will generally be paid to our named executive officers and our other principals as annual bonus compensation from time to time         in  our named executive officers received distributions on their vested kkr holdings units and because these distributions are not considered to be compensation they have not been reported in the summary compensation table compensation elements base salary         for  each of our named executive officers was paid an annual salary of  we believe that the base salary of our named executive officers should typically not be the most significant  table of contents component of total compensation our cochief executive officers determined that this amount was a sufficient minimum base salary for our named executive officers and decided that it should be the same for all named executive officers we are responsible for funding this base salary yearend bonus compensation         other than their salary and certain incidental benefits noted below under other compensation our cochief executive officers did not receive any additional compensation in  they have decided at this time not to receive any bonus or other amounts from us or from kkr holdings in excess of distributions payable with respect to their kkr holdings units instead they have decided that yearend bonus payments from kkr holdings should be made to our other principals in order to motivate and retain them for the benefit of the firm         in  our chief administrative officer chief financial officer and general counsel were awarded additional yearend compensation as bonus payments that were determined by our cochief executive officers our cochief executive officers made their subjective determinations by assessing our overall performance and the contributions that our chief administrative officer chief financial officer and general counsel made to our development and success as a firm during the year certain factors that were considered when determining the size of the bonus payments for our chief administrative officer chief financial officer and general counsel include i their respective contributions and accomplishments in  in terms of driving commercial results for the firm leading and managing people and living the firms values ii their respective performance and contributions relative to other senior principals in the firm iii their respective performance and contributions in  as compared to the prior year and iv the overall financial performance of the firm in  as compared to the prior year based on certain financial measures considered by management including total distributable earnings more specifically in assessing mr fishers contributions they considered his service as the firms chief administrative officer his role in overseeing the growth and operations of the firm his leadership in the development of our real estate business and his leadership on the strategic direction of the firm generally in assessing mr janetscheks contributions they considered his service as the chief financial officer and his leadership and oversight of our finance tax and accounting functions and his role with respect to strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm finally in assessing mr sorkins contributions they considered his leadership and oversight of our global legal and compliance functions and his role with respect to the strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm in part because the firms total distributable earnings increased in  relative to the prior year the size of the bonus payments was higher in  as a result of the firms financial performance in making these determinations our cochief executive officers consulted with certain of our senior principals and with respect to the determinations for our chief financial officer and general counsel considered the recommendations of our chief administrative officer we believe that the discretion permitted to our cochief executive officers permits them to award bonus compensation in an amount necessary to motivate and retain these named executive officers         once the bonus amount is determined the bonus amount is divided into cash compensation and for our named executive officers a recommendation to our managing partners board of directors for an award of deferred equity bonus compensation the amount of deferred equity bonus compensation for our principals is calculated using a graduated range of percentages applied to different incremental amounts of total salary and bonus compensation ranging from  to          the cash bonus amounts paid to our chief administrative officer our chief financial officer and our general counsel for  are reflected in the bonus column of the  summary compensation table below although these cash bonus payments have been economically borne by kkr holdings we expect that over time we may be required to pay a portion or eventually all of these cash bonus payments as kkr holdings becomes unable to reserve cash for bonus compensation as more kkr holdings units vest  table of contents         the portion of the bonus payment granted to our named executive officers other than our cochief executive officers who received none as  deferred equity bonus compensation consists of grants of equity awards issued under the equity incentive plan these equity awards are restricted equity units that may be settled for our common units on a oneforone basis see below under terms of restricted equity units for more information we call these equity grants deferred equity bonus compensation because our named executive officers ability to monetize them into cash is deferred to the future when the vesting provisions and any applicable transfer restrictions discussed below lapse         the number of restricted equity units granted to our named executive officers other than our cochief executive officers who received none is determined by our managing partners board of directors as part of  yearend bonus compensation our managing partners board of directors approved the following grants  restricted equity units to our chief administrative officer  restricted equity units to our chief financial officer and  restricted equity units to our general counsel the number of restricted equity units was determined by dividing the dollar amount of deferred equity bonus compensation recommended by the cochief executive officers to the board of directors by the average closing price of our common units over the last five trading days in  because these grants were made after december   and restricted equity units for deferred equity bonus compensation are generally issued in the first quarter of the following year they do not appear in the tables below but will appear in the tables for the year ended december           the restricted equity units that were granted as deferred equity bonus compensation grants in respect of fiscal  yearend compensation are subject to a threeyear servicebased vesting condition with the first vesting event occurring on april   these restricted equity units are not subject to additional transfer restrictions after vesting or any minimum retained ownership requirement vesting serves as an employment retention mechanism and thereby enhances the alignment of interests between our named executive officers who receive yearend compensation payments and the firm carried interest         we allocate and distribute to a carry pool  of the carried interest that we earn from which our principals are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation carry pool allocations for the named executive officers are made by first determining a total dollar value for the named executive officers interest in the carry pool due to their unique status as cofounders of our firm our cochief executive officers determine their own allocation from the carry pool to make this total dollar value determination for the other named executive officers our cochief executive officers take into consideration the executive officers involvement with investments and impact on the portfolio the size of the executive officers bonus and other factors similar to those considered when determining the size of the bonus as described under yearend bonus compensation however the total dollar value available to be allocated to the named executive officers and other employees is limited by the total amount of investments made by our investment funds during the fiscal year and executive officers and other employees may not be allocated any dollar value of carry in any given year after a total dollar value if any for each named executive officer is determined such dollar value is then divided by the total value of investments made by our funds for the year which yields a certain percentage for the named executive officer this percentage is then applied consistently to each investment made during the year because the size of each investment is different the nominal amount of the carry pool allocation differs by investment although the percentage applied to each investment is consistent the carry pool is maintained and administered by kkr associates holdings lp which similar to kkr holdings is not a subsidiary of ours allocations are determined by our cochief executive officers acting through the general partner of kkr associates holdings lp         carried interest if any from the carry pool in respect of any particular investment is only paid in cash after all of the following are met i a realization event has occurred eg sale of a portfolio company dividend etc ii the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its  table of contents inception in excess of performance hurdles where applicable and iii with respect to investments with a fair value below cost cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments fair value to the extent any clawback obligation is triggered carried interest previously distributed by the fund would have to be returned to such fund thereby reducing the named executive officers overall compensation for any such year from time to time a portion of certain carried interest payable may not be or for certain of our funds will not be distributed to the recipient and would instead be held in escrow in order to enhance the recipients ability to satisfy any future clawback obligation because the amount of carried interest payable is directly tied to the realized performance of the underlying investments we believe this fosters a strong alignment of interests among the investors in those funds and the named executive officers and thus benefits our unitholders in addition several of our competitors use participation in carried interest as an important compensation element and we believe that we must do the same in order to attract and retain the most qualified personnel         participation in our carry pool for our principals including our named executive officers is subject only to servicebased vesting with certain exceptions including acceleration upon death or disability in general the vesting for carry pool allocations for investments made in  is annual over a fouryear period other than for our cochief executive officers the vesting schedules for investments made prior to  range from fouryear vesting with no vesting upon grant for the most junior principals up to twoyear vesting and  vesting upon grant for most senior principals vesting serves as an employment retention mechanism and enhances the alignment of interests between a participant in our carry pool and the firm as well as the limited partners in our investment funds due to their status as cofounders of our firm our cochief executive officers are typically completely vested in their carried interest allocations upon grant other compensation         our cochief executive officers are reimbursed by us for the use of a car and driver and we pay for the compensation of certain personnel who administer personal matters for them we believe that these benefits are appropriate in light of the time that they spend on our business the limited compensation paid by us for their services and their unique status as cofounders of our firm in addition we may pay for certain tax preparation fees for our named executive officers minimum retained ownership         while employed by us unless waived in whole or in part each of our named executive officers is required to hold at least  of the cumulative amount of kkr holdings units that have satisfied the servicebased vesting condition during the duration of his employment with the firm in addition unless waived in whole or in part each of our named executive officers may be required on a grant by grant basis to hold common unit equivalents of  of the cumulative restricted equity units granted under the equity incentive plan that have satisfied the servicebased vesting condition during the duration of his employment with the firm compensation and risk         our compensation program includes elements that we believe discourages excessive risktaking and aligns the compensation of our employees with the longterm performance of the firm for example other than certain equity that either immediately vested as part of the grants to all employees or our founders or that were made in exchange for the contribution of assets in each case in connection with the consummation of the kpe transaction in october  a significant majority of the equity awards held by our principals are subject to a multiyear service vesting condition one and twoyear transfer restriction periods andor a minimum retained ownership requirement in addition except in circumstances noted elsewhere in this report the equity awards held by our other employees are also  table of contents generally subject to a multiyear service vesting condition and may also be subject to postvesting transfer restrictions andor a minimum retained ownership requirement because our equity awards have multiyear vesting provisions the actual amount of compensation realized by the recipient will be tied to the longterm performance of our common units pursuant to our internal policies our employees are not permitted to buy or sell derivative securities including for hedging purposes or to engage in shortselling to hedge their economic risk of ownership in addition we only make cash payments of carried interest to our principals when profitable investments have been realized and after sufficient cash has been distributed to the investors in our funds moreover the general partner of a fund is required to return carried interest distributions to the fund due to for example underperformance by the relevant fund subsequent to the payment of such carried interest accordingly the principal would be subject to a clawback ie be required to return carried interest payments previously made to a principal all of which further discourages excessive risktaking by our personnel summary compensation table         the following table presents summary information concerning compensation that was paid for services rendered by our named executive officers during the fiscal years ended december    and          in   and  our named executive officers received distributions based on their vested kkr holdings units because these distributions are not considered to be compensation

holdings are subject to transfer restrictions and except for interests held by our cochief executive officers and certain interests that were vested when granted in connection with the kpe transaction in october  subject to multiyear servicebased vesting requirements due to their unique status as cofounders of our firm our cochief executive officers are completely vested in their ownership of kkr holdings units         in general unvested kkr holdings units initially vest in equal installments over a multiyear period which can range from three to five years from the grant date subject to the recipients continued employment with us following this initial vesting or the grant date if interests were vested upon grant interests remain contingently vested while they are subject to certain transfer restrictions unvested kkr holdings units are not entitled to receive distributions         kkr holdings units that are subject to transfer restrictions unless waived may not be sold exchanged or otherwise transferred for a specified period of time following the initial vesting date the transfer restriction period typically lasts for  one year with respect to onehalf of the units vesting on the vesting date and  two years with respect to the other onehalf of the units vesting on such vesting date transfer restricted units become fully vested and transferable and may be exchanged into common units at the end of the transfer restriction period if the holder is not terminated for cause and has complied with the terms of his or her confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreement during the transfer restrictions period see terms of confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements below         because kkr holdings is a partnership all of the kkr holdings units have been legally allocated but the allocation of certain of these units had not been communicated to each respective principal as of december   the units whose allocation has not been communicated are subject to performancebased vesting conditions which include i whether the principal is in good standing and has adhered to our policies and rules ii performance of assigned tasks and duties in an effective efficient and diligent manner iii contribution and commitment to the growth development and profitability of kkr and our business iv contribution and commitment to our management and general administration v contribution and commitment to the culture business principles reputation and morale of kkr as a whole and the team or teams to which the principal has been assigned and vi contribution and commitment to our recruiting business development public image and marketing efforts and the professional development of our personnel these criteria are not sufficiently specific to constitute performance conditions for accounting purposes and the achievement or lack thereof will be determined based upon the exercise of judgment by the general partner of kkr holdings each principal will ultimately receive between zero and  of the units initially allocated the allocation of these units has not yet been communicated to the award recipients as this was managements decision on how to best incentivize its principals it is anticipated that additional servicebased vesting conditions will be imposed at the time the allocation is initially communicated to the respective principals we applied the guidance of asc topic  and concluded that these kkr holdings units do not yet meet the criteria for recognition of compensation cost because neither the grant date nor the service inception date has occurred in reaching a conclusion that the service inception date has not occurred we considered  the fact that the vesting conditions are not sufficiently specific to constitute  table of contents performance conditions for accounting purposes  the significant judgment that can be exercised by the general partner of kkr holdings in determining whether the vesting conditions are ultimately achieved and  the absence of communication to the principals of any information related to the number of units they were initially allocated the allocation of these units will be communicated to the award recipients when the performancebased vesting conditions have been met and currently there is no plan as to when the communication will occur the determination as to whether the award recipients have satisfied the performancebased vesting conditions is made by the general partner of kkr holdings and is based on multiple factors primarily related to the award recipients individual performance         while employed by our firm our principals including our named executive officers are also subject to minimum retained ownership rules that require them to continuously hold at least  of their cumulatively vested kkr holdings units unless waived         the transfer and vesting restrictions and minimum retained ownership rules applicable to kkr holdings units may not be enforceable in all cases and can be waived modified or amended by kkr holdings at any time without our consent         the terms of the kkr holdings units described above are distinct from equity awards issuable under our equity incentive plan which are described below terms of restricted equity units         restricted equity units are equity awards issuable under our equity incentive plan which after vesting may be settled for our common units on a oneforone basis or an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such common units         in general restricted equity units are subject to a servicebased vesting condition and vest in equal annual installments over a multiyear period generally three to five years from a specified date subject to the recipients continued employment with us following this servicebased vesting certain restricted equity unit grant agreements may also subject the common units delivered upon settlement of such restricted equity units to transfer restrictions andor minimum retained ownership requirements unvested restricted equity units granted under our equity incentive plan are not entitled to receive distributions

exchanges or limit the number of units exchanged in a given quarter the amendments also provided that certain exchanges will be with a new subsidiary the result of which is that the income tax character of a small portion of income distributed to unitholders may differ from what it would have been absent the amendment if additional taxes result from the inclusion of this subsidiary of ours kkr holdings will make payments to one of our subsidiaries in respect of those taxes         certain interests in kkr holdings that are held by our principals are subject to transfer restrictions and vesting requirements that unless waived modified or amended limit the ability of our principals to cause kkr group partnership units to be exchanged under the exchange agreement so long as applicable vesting and transfer restrictions apply the general partner of kkr holdings which is controlled by our founders will have sole authority for waiving any applicable vesting or transfer restrictions         as contemplated by the exchange agreement a coordinated selling program has been established relating to sales of common units received pursuant to the exchanges by holders of kkr holdings units pursuant to the program sales generally take place quarterly and management is permitted to establish an overall limit on such sales based upon the trading volume of our common units or any other factor that may be considered relevant registration rights agreement         in connection with our nyse listing we entered into a registration rights agreement with kkr holdings pursuant to which we granted kkr holdings its affiliates and transferees of its kkr group partnership units the right under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions to require us to register under the securities act our common units and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common units held or acquired by them under the registration rights agreement holders of registration rights will have the right to request us to register the common units received upon the exchange of their kkr holdings units and the sale of such common units and also have the right to require us to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of common units into the market from time to time over an extended period in addition holders of  table of contents registration rights will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in connection with registered offerings requested by other holders of registration rights or initiated by us on october   the registration statement we filed pursuant to this agreement was declared effective and a posteffective amendment was declared effective on september   as of december    common units remain unissued under that registration statement tax receivable agreement         we and one or more of our intermediate holding companies may be required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings kkr management holdings lp has made and in the future intends to continue to make an election under section  of the internal revenue code in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of kkr group partnership units for common units occurs certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in certain of our intermediate holding companies share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available this increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain or increase loss on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets         we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings requiring the intermediate holding company to pay to kkr holdings or transferees of its kkr group partnership units  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of this increase in tax basis as well as  of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement a termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events this payment obligation is an obligation of the intermediate holding companies and not of either kkr group partnership as such the cash distributions to common unitholders may vary from holders of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings and others to the extent payments are made under the tax receivable agreements to exchanging holders of kkr group partnership units as the payments reflect actual tax savings received by kkr entities there may be a timing difference between the tax savings received by kkr entities and the cash payments to exchanging holders of kkr group partnership units we expect the intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining  of cash savings if any in income tax that it realizes in the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire kkr group partnership units in the future or if we become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms         for purposes of the tax receivable agreement cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of our subsidiary to the amount of such taxes that the intermediate holding companies would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships as a result of the exchanges of kkr group partnership units and had the intermediate holding companies not entered into the tax receivable agreement the term of the tax receivable agreement continues until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless the intermediate holding companies exercise their right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement         estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors the  table of contents actual increase in tax basis as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors including  the timing of exchangesfor instance the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair market value which may fluctuate over time of the kkr group partnership units which will depend on the fair market value of the depreciable or amortizable assets of the kkr group partnerships at the time of the transaction  the price of our common units at the time of the exchangethe increase in any tax deductions as well as the tax basis increase in other assets of the kkr group partnerships is directly proportional to the price of our common units at the time of the exchange  the extent to which such exchanges are taxableif an exchange is not taxable for any reason for instance in the case of a charitable contribution increased deductions will not be available and  the amount of tax if any our intermediate holding company is required to pay aside from any tax benefit from the exchanges and the timing of any such payment if our intermediate holding companies do not have taxable income aside from any tax benefit from the exchanges it will not be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for that taxable year because no tax savings will have been actually realized         we expect that as a result of the amount of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization of our assets future payments under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our principals continued ownership of us and are required to be made within  days of the filing of the tax return of kkr management holdings corp for the year ended december   such payments made to our principals none of whom included a member of the board of directors of our managing partner were approximately  million such payments to kkr holdings were  million and a de minimis amount was paid to messrs fisher and janetschek         the intermediate holding companies may terminate the tax receivable agreement at any time by making an early termination payment to kkr holdings or its transferees based upon the net present value based upon certain assumptions in the tax receivable agreement of all tax benefits that would be required to be paid by the intermediate holding companies to kkr holdings or its transferees in addition the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers asset sales other forms of combination transactions or other changes of control the minimum obligations of our intermediate holding companies or their successor with respect to exchanged or acquired kkr group partnership units whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction would be based on certain assumptions including that our intermediate holding companies would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and increased tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement in these situations our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity         decisions made by our senior principals in the course of running our business such as with respect to mergers asset sales other forms of business combinations or other changes of control may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling holder of partner interests in the kkr group partnerships under the tax receivable agreement for example the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such payments and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase a principals tax liability without giving rise to any rights of a principal to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement  table of contents         payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based upon the tax reporting positions that our managing partner will determine we are not aware of any issue that would cause the irs to challenge a tax basis increase however neither kkr holdings nor its transferees will reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis increase or the tax benefits we claim arising from such increase is successfully challenged by the irs as a result in certain circumstances payments to kkr holdings or its transferees under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the intermediate holding companys cash tax savings the intermediate holding companys ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase and the payments to be made under this agreement will depend upon a number of factors as discussed above including the timing and amount of our future income kkr group partnership agreements         we indirectly control the general partners of the kkr group partnerships and through the kkr group partnerships and their subsidiaries the kkr business because our managing partner operates and controls us our managing partners board of directors and our officers are ultimately responsible for all material decisions of the kkr group partnerships and the kkr group partnerships businesses         pursuant to the partnership agreements of the kkr group partnerships our partnership as the controlling general partner of kkr fund holdings lp and kkr management holdings lp have the indirect right to determine when distributions will be made to the holders of kkr group partnership units and the amount of any such distributions         the partnership agreements of the kkr group partnerships provide for tax distributions to the holders of kkr group partnership units if the general partners of the kkr group partnerships determine that distributions from the kkr group partnerships would otherwise be insufficient to cover the tax liabilities of a holder of a kkr group partnership unit generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a holder of a kkr group partnership unit multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income         the partnership agreements of the kkr group partnerships authorize the general partners of the kkr group partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional securities of the kkr group partnerships with such designations preferences rights powers and duties that are different from and may be senior to those applicable to the kkr group partnerships units and which may be exchangeable for kkr group partnership units firm use of private aircraft         certain of our senior principals including messrs kravis and roberts own aircraft that we use for business purposes in the ordinary course of our operations these senior principals paid for the purchase of these aircraft with their personal funds and bear all operating personnel and maintenance costs associated with their operation the hourly rates that we pay for the use of these aircraft are based on current market rates for chartering private aircraft of the same type we paid  million for the use of these aircraft during the year ended december   of which  million was paid to entities collectively controlled by messrs kravis and roberts sidebyside and other investments         because fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the funds manager also invests its own capital in the funds investments our investment fund documents generally require the general partners of our investment funds to make minimum capital commitments to the  table of contents funds the amount of these commitments which are negotiated by fund investors generally range from  to  of a funds total capital commitments at final closing but may be greater for certain funds pursuing new strategies when investments are made the general partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and if applicable acquires a capital interest in the investment that is not subject to a carried interest historically these capital contributions have been funded with cash from operations that otherwise would be distributed to our principals and by our principals         in connection with the kpe transaction we did not acquire capital interests in investments that were funded by our principals or others involved in our business prior to october   rather those capital interests were allocated to our principals or others involved in our business and are reflected in our financial statements as noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities to the extent that we hold the general partner interest in the fund any capital contributions that our private equity fund general partners are required to make to a fund will be funded by us and we will be entitled to receive our allocable share of the returns thereon         in addition our principals and certain other qualifying employees are permitted to invest and have invested their own capital in sidebyside investments with our funds sidebyside investments are investments made on the same terms and conditions as those available to the applicable fund except that these sidebyside investments are not subject to management fees or a carried interest the cash invested by our executive officers and their investment vehicles aggregated to  million for the year ended december   of which  million  million  million  million and  million was invested by messrs kravis roberts fisher janetschek and sorkin respectively these investments are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in addition our funds invested  million in  from the commitments of certain investment vehicles

indemnification         the partnership documents governing kkrs carrypaying funds including funds relating to private equity mezzanine infrastructure energy direct lending and special situations investments generally include a clawback provision that if triggered may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund under a clawback obligation upon the liquidation of a fund the general partner is required to return typically on an aftertax basis previously distributed carry to the extent that due to the diminished performance of later investments the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance thresholds excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to kkr in the kpe transaction as of december   no carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their december   fair values had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value the clawback obligation would have been  million carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the funds investments were realized at the then estimated fair values amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable preferred return thresholds have been met if these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled a clawback obligation would be recorded for funds that are consolidated this clawback obligation if any is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition for funds that are not consolidated this clawback obligation if any is reflected as a reduction of kkrs investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded         certain private equity funds that were contributed to kkr in the kpe transaction also include a net loss sharing provision upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing  table of contents obligation applies the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle to fund  of the net losses on investments in these vehicles such losses would be required to be paid by kkr to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to kkr relative to the capital that kkr contributed to it as general partner based on the fair market values as of december   there would have been no net loss sharing obligation if the vehicles were liquidated at zero value the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately  million as of december           prior to the kpe transaction certain kkr principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to kkr had personally guaranteed on a several basis and subject to a cap the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners clawback obligations the terms of the kpe transaction require that kkr principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the kpe transaction up to a maximum of  million through investment realizations this amount has been reduced to  million as of december   using valuations as of december   no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by kkr principals carry distributions arising subsequent to the kpe transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to kkr and kkrs principals who participate in the carry pool unlike the clawback obligation kkr will be responsible for amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify kkrs principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts in addition guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment
