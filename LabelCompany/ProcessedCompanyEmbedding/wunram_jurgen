by kluge jurgen deger rupert wunram jurgen read preview academic journal article the mckinsey quarterly can germany still innovate by kluge jurgen deger rupert wunram jurgen read preview article excerpt a survey of electronics companies shows a oncegreat industrial innovator has fallen behind however its problems can be solved by management actions five strategies for change its not news to anyone that some of germanys industrial companies are having problems these days burdened with excessive costs at home they are steadily losing share in the global marketplace but it is not too late for a turnaround a good number of leading companies are restructuring to achieve a competitive cost base from which they are beginning to expand aggressively in europe or even worldwide costcutting alone will not be enough however if german companies want to recapture their lost share of world sales they must also find new sources of revenue geographic expansion will help but innovation is equally important  especially if the changes needed throughout industry are to be carried out in a socially responsible way by  for example restructuring of european telecommunications is likely to have eliminated as many as  percent of the 00 jobs that existed in the industry in  without new innovative businesses employment in many sectors has nowhere to go but down besides losing its welltrained workforce a company that neglects new product development is likely also to lose its competitiveness one leading german electronics manufacturer for example drew about  percent of its revenues in the late 9s from products that were clearly superior to those of its competitors five years later that share had fallen to  percent  years later the company had not a single superior product indeed as much as  percent of its revenue came from products that were inferior to those of competitors innovation is no easy business the development and introduction of new products usually require tremendous investment in rd and long lead times paybacks are still further down the road and because the innovation cycle is shortening products are quickly outdated the mechanical typewriter for example had a life cycle of  years its electric successor lasted 0 years and the pc wordprocessing software of today is upgraded almost every six months by the time most companies have a new technology well in hand moreover they usually find the market saturated with products based on similar technology at this stage even heavy rd expenditure will probably yield only marginal improvements in their own product and rd productivity will already be on a downward track it is at this point that companies have to leap to a new technology scurve they must have the courage to innovate before the market becomes saturated or an innovator with greater rd productivity attacks the market with a new product in a new technology companies such as hewlettpackard are adept at taking such leaps generating  to  percent of their revenues from products introduced within the previous year such courage has long been rewarded with higher profits while average us corporate profits fell by almost  percent between  and 9 particularly innovative companies such as those belonging to the american business conference raised them by about 0 percent innovation gaps german companies were once renowned as the best most prolific innovators setting world standards aniline chemical dyes electroengines the first commercial motor car benzmotorwagen and xrays were all german inventions and germans led the development of television rockets jetengines and highspeed trains those days are long gone though many german companies still acknowledge the importance of innovation few have moved decisively or rapidly enough to improve their recent track records mckinseys bestpractice survey of  electronics companies worldwide  including  european companies most of which were german  confirms this …
