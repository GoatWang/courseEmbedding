join nowgo»aratana therapeutics will it get over its manufacturing issuesjul   about aratana therapeutics petx avisol capital partners longshort equity newsletter provider healthcare biotechavisol capital partnerssummarypetx has had trouble delivering drugs even after approvalhowever it has a strong pipeline and is doing very well in the approval frontthe manufacturing issues are probably short term and the pullback is an opportunity to invest by dr ashok dutta bvscah aratana therapeutics petx has three approved products  nocita entyce and galliprant two of these  nocita and galliprant  are marketed and entyce is awaiting market entry because of a manufacturing issue nocita is marketed by aratana itself while it has a collaboration for galliprant with elanco there are a number of excellent articles written on petx here on seeking alpha notably the ones by this author even more enlightening are comments by four readers two of whom are american vets themselves and two others who are also very knowledgeable there is no need for me to redo the wheel and my readers can read those articles and comments to get a wellrounded picture of petx as an investment instead i will simply provide my own perspective as a veterinary surgeon what is attractive about petx as an investment choice while there are so many exciting new developments ongoing in cancer or cns or heart diseases in humans the very first reason any vet would invest in petx is because it is a pureplay veterinary medicines developer and believe it or not we are proud one of our own is doing good that is irrational but that is probably going to be true for many of us however there’s a rational aspect to this and that is true for all investors that is this all the large vet medicine developers are attached to or spun off from big pharma human meds developers the movements of their stocks aren’t entirely tied in to the animal medicine market if you are approaching animal medicine as a hedge investment you won’t find that with those mixedpipeline pharma petx on the other hand is exclusively about cats and dogs and other animals so its distinctness makes it simpler as an investment idea the other reason is its astounding development in a matter of only  years of existence petx started out in  with the agenda of producing animal medicines out of successful human medicines concepts in just four years it has  approved products a longtailed pipeline and it only burned through about mn of investor money before it produced results compare that with any human medicine developer and these companies often take many decades and many hundred millions of dollars before they are anywhere near an approval there are other company specific reasons for liking petx its  approved drugs together come to almost a few hundred million dollars in sales potential galliprant will only help petx earn royalties since the drug was licensed to elanco from which it will receive doubledigit royalties given the marketing and sales prowess of the much larger eli lilly nyselly spinoff galliprant will perhaps bring a steady flow of revenue to petx nocita is a bit of a specialized pain reliever indicated officially for local postoperative analgesic for cranial cruciate ligament crcl surgery for dogs according to the american college of veterinary surgeons “rupture of the crcl is one of the most common reasons for hind limb lameness pain and subsequent knee arthritis” however petx believes that nocita may have potential in other conditions as well its sales has been modest so far entyce is the most interesting of all its drugs and may possibly have wider application across species i am not aware of its capabilities in the large animal scenario but loss of appetite is a major problem with many different kinds of animals so we are looking at a potentially large market for all three drugs combined however there’s a puzzling problem with this entire rosy scenario that makes one hesitant to bet much on petx the company has very poor manufacturing ability time and again it has failed to deliver medicines after approval that is the major reason i would shy away from this company as a small company petx must have managed to focus only on its regulatory phase ignoring its manufacturing phase and now it is suffering earlier it failed to deliver nocita to pharmacies and vets then its market launch of entyce got delayed because of manufacturing issues entyce is the first and only cvm approved appetitestimulant it was approved last year but petx had to get a new manufacturing facility approved because the old one was not able to deliver it seems  and that delayed the launch now it seems that entyce will only be launched by the end of  finally galliprant is also being manufactured at petx facilities and there is concern that galliprant too will suffer from manufacturing issues while many of us consider galliprant a vast improvement on other nsaids like carprofen available as a generic if you don’t get a good drug even after ordering for months you will fall back on the more available and cheaper drugs and may actually give up on the new drug that hasn’t filled its order yet overall this small company does not seem to have got a grip of its manufacturing issues yet financials aratana continues to improve its financial standing as shown by its latest quarterly earnings announcement the company reported a steep rise in its revenue to  million for the first quarter of the year from the  it had reported for the corresponding quarter of the previous year while the company saw an astronomical rise in its revenue it also managed to bring its quarterly net loss down to  million in comparison to the net loss of  million it had incurred in the first quarter of  the company’s total operating costs also decreased from  million to  million on a yearoveryear basis the decline was mainly due to research  development expenses coming down from  million to  million aratana expects its operating expenses to further decline as it projected its full year operating expenses to be close to  million with the expected increase in revenue and the decline in costs the company is likely to contain its net losses in the coming quarters the company showed a slight increase in its net cash used in operating activities aratana’s cash burn in operating activities during the first quarter of the year stood at  million while the corresponding figure for the first quarter of  was reported at  million despite the increase in its revenue the company concluded the first quarter with relatively lower cash and equivalents balance than the preceding quarter the company reported  million in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash while the corresponding balance for the quarter ended on december   was at  million aratana also inked a deal to sell  million of its shares to certain investors the company expects to receive  million in net payments together with these proceedings aratana is in position to fund its operations and debt obligations through  putting it in a solid financial position with relatively low dilution risk for the next  months on the other hand however petx is selling about midway from its week high after having recovered from a major pullback earlier this year but still a long way to go to its week highs the manufacturing issues while a matter of concern are transient and investors must understand that the company has three drugs approved and many more in the pipeline and will certainly get over its manufacturing hurdles or get acquired either way there’s strong upside from the current levels while i would have preferred to say this when it was even further down i think there’s a good reason it is still a fine investment at these levels disclosure i amwe are long petx i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking

response to news of a delayed product launch brian feroldi tmftypeoh feb   at pm what happened after aratana therapeutics nasdaqpetx a biotech company focused on pet health announced the delay of a new product launch shares fell  as of  am est on monday so what the pet therapeutics company disclosed in a securities and exchange commission filing on monday that the food and drug administrations center for veterinary medicine cvm has requested more information about its appetite stimulant entyce specifically the cvm is looking for additional data related to the companys plans to transfer the manufacturing of entyce to a new vendor  according to aratana this unexpected information request is going to delay the drugs launch until late  investors are not taking the news well hence todays decline image source getty images now what aratana gained fda approval for entyce way back in may  so this update means that it will take the company more than a year to bring this drug to market thats never a good sign for any biotech company let alone one that is still losing money each quarter  on the positive side the delay should also allow aratana to throw more of its resources behind the launch of nocita this drug is approved for use in dogs as postoperative analgesia following cranial cruciate ligament surgery management stated that gaining market adoption for this drug will take quite a bit of time since access to the surgeons who perform this procedure is much harder than selling to general practitioners in addition mondays update doesnt change the fact that enctyes market potential remains quite large  still delays are never good so it is hard to blame the markets for punishing the companys stock today brian feroldi has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley

enrolled approximately  dogs in its mini bchomp study investigating the use of at in combination with abbreviated chemotherapy in canine bcell lymphoma the results are anticipated in mid previously the company had received encouraging results from three independent studies looking at using at in combination with chemotherapyaratana has been conducting two randomized placebocontrolled studies tchomp and tlab looking at the potential benefit of at in combination with two specific chemotherapy protocols and conducting a clinical experience program tcep where oncologists use the product at their discretion and share the data with aratana although dogs are still being followed in those studies and final results are expected by mid aratana completed an analysis of the results thus far and at does not seem to be adding significant progression free survival in canine tcell lymphoma recent scientific studies suggest that at and at are not as specific to the targets as expectedgiven the mixed clinical and scientific results aratana does not believe at or at in their current firstgeneration forms will capture the desired lymphoma market opportunity therefore aratana is pursuing
