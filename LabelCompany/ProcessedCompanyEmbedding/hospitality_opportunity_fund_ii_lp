represents hospitality with a purpose to celebrate nature while encouraging sophisticated travelers to live well do better and connect with the world around them design leadership starwood capital believes that it possesses an expertise in the design of real estate assets that is unsurpassed in the private equity industry this sensibility starts at the top ceo barry sternlicht is a member of the interior design hall of fame and the firm’s head of design was recently inducted into the hospitality design platinum circle a number of starwood capital’s assets have been acclaimed for their aesthetics which ultimately help drive value for the firm’s investors approach starwood capital seeks to deliver consistent robust returns while placing a premium on preserving capital the team performs a comprehensive riskreturn analysis on each potential transaction and only invest in assets and businesses with asymmetrical return potential guided by common sense discipline and the recognition that intellectual humility is the foundation of successful investing the firm adheres to the following core principles invest when new supply is low target markets with high barriers to entry and little to no competitive supply planned or under construction since the economic recovery has generally been slow and steady starwood capital has not seen the type of aggressive supply that would typically result from the recent rent growth and strength of the markets anticipate capital flows seek to get ahead of capital flows in areas where economic growth is projected to drive tenant demand but new supply is not yet on the horizon the starwood capital team has found that capital flows often influence asset valuations as much as—or more than—the impact of local market supply and demand trends once these target markets are identified the team works on the “micro” side to pinpoint opportunities for asymmetrical return potential through valueadd asset management buy below replacement cost purchase—at favorable prices—fundamentally sound assets that have previously lacked capital attention or effective management buying below replacement cost offers a margin of safety typically ensuring that no new construction competition will be completed until values rise to justify new product starwood capital’s recent transactions demonstrate that opportunities continue to arise to acquire assets at discounted prices utilize appropriate debt to generate positive leverage seek to use proper leverage—in amount and duration—to reflect the stability of each asset’s cash flow in the current market starwood capital can typically buy property at yields in excess of the cost of debt and generate strong cashoncash yields during the hold period positive leverage allows the investment team to be patient for a recovery lessening the reliance on the residual value to achieve strong returns in most cases starwood capital can secure debt longer than the expected hold period—thus creating a potential asset upon exit if interest rates rise construct diversified portfolios actively manage concentrations of fund capital by diversifying exposures across risk profiles geographic areas asset classes and positions in the capital structure add value to investments through handson asset management acquire undermanaged or undercapitalized assets that the starwood capital team can stabilize and refurbish and implement a dynamic asset management plan in order to position each investment for sale at the maximum price in appropriate cases the firm can create a growth platform through the acquisition of complementary assets andor portfolios maintain investment discipline seek to enhance returns in both cyclical downturns and upswings by maintaining a disciplined approach to assets and their value for example prior to the market crash in 0 starwood capital minimized its acquisitions and maximized dispositions of assets—whereas in subsequent years the firm shifted its focus toward a higher volume of acquisitions by the same token the firm took advantage of a number of distressed investment opportunities in the wake of the great recession but shifted toward more defensive asset classes in recent years capitalize on the firm’s disposition expertise design optimal exit strategies that can generate maximum asset value with options including an individual asset sale portfolio sale operating company sale or public market execution—all of which starwood capital has extensive experience in executing align interests with investors treat starwood capital investment partners’ capital as the firm’s own—because a meaningful portion of it is the firm’s own starwood capital’s partners invest alongside its lps in every transaction that they sponsor starwood capital has never taken fund transaction fees—believing instead that the firm should profit only after its investors receive a full return of their capital plus an attractive
