helpfulness see    displaying items  of  page  of   next caelro age  gender female  stars out of  june   caelro age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  it has been my experience that most parenting books want to tell you that your baby or child must do a b c and to do this as the parent you must do x y z if it fails then you must assume that you are doing something wrong i learned during my early days of parenting that these books arent worth the paper theyre printed on however if youre looking for guidance in the parenting department starting with momumental is not a bad idea this book is different its a lighthearted humorous view on parenthood because really there are time we have to laugh to stop us from crying and ms grant quickly become an ally in parenting this is not another mom vs mom fire ignite think time magazine or someone spouting off a list of dos and donts instead grant is a mom who has been there lived through the early years of parenthood with a handful of kids and is here to tell us that the feelings and thoughts we have especially in the early years are normal and we will survive grant does not paint herself as a perfect parent oh she did have dreams of being a perfect parent especially as a child her childhood being raised in a single parent home after her parent divorced and her dad fell out of the picture led her to have a fantasy about her future life with her future family the reality is a much different life than the envisioned future of a young girl living through a family torn apart but grand is quick to remind us that reality does not equate bad parenthood may not be easy but it can turn out okay im usually hesitant about reading parenting or mom books im happy i gave this one a chance in a world where moms have to be perfect with perfect children or face the harshness of other moms and society in general momumental is a breath of fresh air it is a reminder that no mom or dad is prefect and that we will make mistakes grant also reminds us that we shouldnt feel guilty of these mistakes because most will not have any long term effects upon the children having a fantasy family is just thata fantasy but with hard work and some stumbles along the way we can create something wonderful within our family and reading grants book is like sitting around with your girlfriends over a cup of coffee sharing your parenting dirt with sympathetic compassion instead of condemnation was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate wanda costinak ontario age  gender female  stars out of  intentional and relaxed parenting may   wanda costinak ontario age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  i wasnt really looking for another book on parenting to review as ive received several of these in the last while however when i was given the opportunity to read momumental adventures in the messy art of raising a family by jennifer grant i jumped at the chance my parenting leans heavily toward the messy side and i have found parenting to be one adventure after another  how could i resist such a book grant opens the door to her life as a mother raising four children and honestly shares her struggles and successes i particularly appreciated how she directs the focus toward being more intentional with our children this has been a recurring theme in my life and it is great to have it reinforced again life happens at such a frantic pace and i have found many parents who are struggling to remember to stop and live in the moment with their children the writing is conversational and casual and the chapters are short enough to read during quiet moments snatched throughout the day grant gently guides the reader to remember gods grace in their parenting and challenges parents to keep god as the primary focus in their childrens lives she even includes a prayer from the episcopalian book of common prayer for parents to rip out of the back of the book and post on the fridge momumental is not so much a howto book as it is an encouraging and comforting story of one mom trying her best and getting it right and a challenge for us to do the sameã¢â¬âall while getting messy and loving the adventure i give this book  stars out of  i received this book free from worthy publishing i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have

are you looking for a light hearted wonderful and postive parenting book that wont make you feel bad in the end then go to your local book store or library and grab a copy of momumental thank you

and nodding along with the author in agreement with her bangon assessment of life and the joys and pitfalls of parenting jennifer grant has written a treasure a book that assures parents and obviously moms in particular that its okay not to be perfect and that they are not alone i utterly appreciated grants ability to speak to the reader in a manner that makes you feel like you are sitting down having coffee with her and comparing notes on the craziness and beauty of guiding the next generation the book is chockfull of wisdom yet it is delivered with such wit and realness and in such a nonjudgemental manner that you cannot help but soak it up and think about how you could apply it to your own life what i most take away is the assurance that despite our mistakes that as we parent our children with love our children will keep growing and changing becoming more independent more empathetic more the people god has created them to be sometimes its easy to forget that we are not parenting alone but that god is right there along side us and that he has an even better plan than we do for their lives i thank the author for the courage in sharing so much of her life with us

includes but is not limited to the following general guidelines after reading this statement and adding angelina jolie into the women as ideal mothers she totally lost me i was a bit let down as i read this book i was expecting more and was left feeling a little empty as i closed the last page what did i take away from these pages its okay that we are not perfect parents no matter how much we try it just simply isnt going to happen gods grace washes over us and the more we can draw near to him the better people we truly are the most important lesson is not to compare yourself to another we take the good the bad and the ugly and reach for gods grace jennifer grant shares humorous stories about her family and does give some good advice throughout the book but for the most part it just wasnt for me you may pick up this book and just love it and soak in the words and gain great insight remember this is just my thoughts about the book this book was a gift from worthy publishers for

the authors story of adopting a daughter from guatemala into the her family of  biological children i have always been intriqued by adoption and after reading this book i feel like a have a truer glimpse into the emotional journey adoption puts parents through i treasured this book as i read it loving the beauty of her diverse family and proud of the author for her challenge to broaden the image of what family looks like the tenderness she felt in her heart for a ã¢â¬ëfourth child that seemed to be missing was a beautiful picture her honesty about her imperfections as a mom and the also the challenges  emotions through the adoption process made her seem like a good friend as i read i particularly liked reading about the blending of family and the learning all the children experinced while they welcomed a new sister i have recommended this book to friends who have considered adoption and this book continues to put questions in my own mind about the role chrisitians can

grace in their parenting and challenges parents to keep god as the primary and i had hoped there would be a big meeting of the two families or perhaps a happy ending involving jennifer but i was still left with a sense of hope that things were changing this book was all about telling a story good enough to sell and you have to have bad guys i would have blown part of that story out of the water for both this book offers that gift page by page along with valuable insights about how to love those closest to you i felt compelled to close my eyes for a moment and take a deep breath before reading on she is so open and unafraid to let you into her home that you feel like a close friend who has dropped by for a visit i am just a few chapters form the end and i cannot make myself finish it i love that she tells what makes her cry in frustration what makes her laugh and the honest stories she is a great writer who lets you know its not just open your house and it makes a family was this review

adopted internationally i could identify with all the emotions and the process  it brought back those emotions and memories for me her writing flowed easily to share her story capturing the details
