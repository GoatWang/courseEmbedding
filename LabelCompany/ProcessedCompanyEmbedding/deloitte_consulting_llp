office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest protest is sustained where in response to a prior protest agency took corrective action by engaging in discussions but imposed unreasonably restrictive limitations on the scope of proposal revisions which prohibit revision of proposal information materially impacted by the corrective action decision deloitte consulting llp of arlington virginia protests the actions of the department of defense defense health agency dha in its implementation of corrective action in response to deloitte’s prior protest of the award of a contract to data networks corporation dnc of reston virginia under request for proposals rfp no htr for the agency’s governance requirements and architecture management support grams requirement  deloitte alleges that the agency has imposed unreasonable limitations on the scope of final proposal revisions fprs by prohibiting revisions in areas of proposals that are materially impacted by the corrective action  we sustain the protest background the agency issued the rfp on february   for the purpose of awarding a contract for the grams requirement which provides program management support to requirement managers in dha’s health information technology directorate  the rfp provided that the grams contract was to be awarded on a bestvalue basis for a oneyear base period and four oneyear option periods  the bestvalue decision was to be based on four evaluation factors and subfactors as follows   factor technical subfactor atechnical approach subfactor bstaffing approach subfactor ctransition in and out subfactor dquality control approach   factor past performance   factor small business participation plan acceptableunacceptable   factor price rfp amendment  at   as relevant the rfp performance work statement identified nine key personnel positions and the minimum requirements for those positions  id at   the rfp provided that the key personnel resumes and commitment letters would be evaluated under “subfactor bstaffing approach” in order to determine the “relevant qualifications and experience of proposed key personnel”  id at  six offerors submitted proposals in response to the rfp  following an initial evaluation discussions and evaluation of fprs the agency made an initial award to dnc on september    deloitte protested that award decision with our office alleging in part that dnc had unmitigable impaired objectivity organizational conflicts of interest ocis due to two other contracts held by dnc  in response to deloitte’s protest the agency informed our office that it would take corrective action and conduct a new oci analysis concerning dnc’s contracts  our office then dismissed deloitte’s protest as academic on october   deloitte consulting llp b oct   unpublished decision the agency completed a new oci analysis memorandum dated december  which concluded that the connections between dnc’s contracts did not present an oci  oci analysis memo at   the agency reaffirmed the prior award to dnc on december   deloitte then filed its second protest of the award decision on january   alleging that the agency’s new oci analysis was unreasonable  deloitte also alleged that the agency’s evaluations of the staffing approach subfactor and the past performance factor were unreasonable and that the agency conducted unequal discussions with respect to past performance  on april   we sustained the protest in part finding that the agency conducted an unreasonable evaluation of the key personnel resumes under the staffing approach subfactor  deloitte consulting llp b b apr    cpd ¶   specifically we concluded that the resumes of multiple key personnel did not demonstrate that the individuals met the minimum requirements of the positions for which they were proposed and that to the extent certain minimum requirements had been waived by the agency we could not conclude that the waiver was equally applied to both offerors’ proposed personnel  id we also sustained the protest on the basis that the agency’s evaluation of past performance was unreasonable and unsupported and that the agency’s discussions with the offerors in this area were unequal  id  we denied the protest with respect to deloitte’s challenge to the agency’s oci analysis  id  we recommended that the agency reopen discussions with the offerors request new fprs and conduct and document a new evaluation in accordance with the evaluation criteria of the rfp  id  we also specifically noted that the agency’s discussions should include evaluation notices concerning any proposed key personnel whose resume did not meet the minimum requirements of the rfp  id on april  the agency advised deloitte of its planned corrective action in the following notice please be advised that the defense health agency intends to take corrective action in this case consistent with the gao’s recommendations following the sustained protest  the agency corrective action will include conducting discussions regarding past performance and key personnel with offerors in the competitive range permitting offerors to submit final proposal revisions fprs limited to past performance and key personnel information reevaluating the offerors’ past performance and key personnel information and making a new source selection decision  the agency expects to execute this corrective action within the next several days request to dismiss protest b may   at   on may  and may  the agency and protester exchanged further correspondence in which the agency indicated that the “description of the scope of the agency’s intended corrective action is accuratewe will limit fpr updates to past performance and key personnel information” and that “the agency will only be reevaluating past performance and key personnel information and does not intend to request revised price proposals from the offerors in the competitive range”  id at  by email on may  the agency sent deloitte evaluation notices and a cover letter that further explained the discussions process and final fpr limitations  the evaluation notices ens concerning deloitte’s key personnel advised that on reevaluation the agency was unable to confirm that deleted of deloitte’s nine key personnel met the minimum requirements of the positions for which they were proposed  in the cover letter the agency advised that it was reopening discussions “only in the areas specifically related to subfactor b key personnel and past performance” and that fprs could update proposals “only in the areas addressed in the enclosed en”  protest b may   at   in response to the cover letter deloitte again contacted the agency to clarify the restrictions on fprs  specifically deloitte advised the agency that changes to its “key personnel information” in response to the agency’s ens would require replacement of deleted previouslyproposed key personnel and would necessitate key personnelrelated revisions to all technical subfactorsnot simply the key personnel area of subfactor b  deloitte explained that this was because the key personnel to be replaced had also been specifically identified in other areas of deloitte’s technical proposal and because the replacement of these personnel otherwise impacted deloitte’s proposed approach such that it will cause a ripple effect throughout the technical proposal  accordingly deloitte requested that the agency confirm its intention to evaluate updated key personnelrelated information throughout the revised technical proposal  by email on may  the agency advised that “the process will remain as stated in the letter    dated may  ”  protest b may   at   deloitte then filed its first protest of the agency’s conduct of the corrective action on may  on august  the gao attorney handling the protest conducted an alternative dispute resolution negotiation assistance conference call with the parties  the gao attorney attempted to clarify the scope of deloitte’s request to revise “key personnel information” throughout its technical proposal as well as the basis for the agency’s opposition to those revisions to assess the possibility of a mutually satisfactory resolution of the protest  during that call the gao attorney expressed concern with the agency’s restrictions on revisions to fprs to the extent that the restrictions would prevent an offeror from revising all references to specific key personnel to be replaced thereby creating potentially material inconsistencies within the offeror’s revised proposal  following this conference call on august  the agency advised our office that it would take corrective action consisting of revising the fpr instructions  our office then dismissed deloitte’s protest on august   deloitte consulting llp b aug   unpublished decision as a result of this corrective action the agency updated its restrictions on fprs as follows  you may make written changes to volume  key personnel under technical subfactor b and  you may make written changes to other aspects of your technical proposal under subfactors a c and d but only to the extent that your initial proposal referenced your key personnel andor the qualifications of said key personnel relative to their ability to execute your proposed technical approach  more specifically the scope of changes to your technical proposal outside of technical subfactor b is limited to updating the names of key personnel as necessary and updating any accompanying qualification descriptions for such new key personnel  you may not update your technical approach under subfactors a c or d corrective action letter august   at  emphasis original on august  deloitte filed the instant protest discussion deloitte argues that the agency’s updated fpr instructions continue to exclude proposal revisions “inextricably linked” to the key personnel substitutions permitted in response to discussions  deloitte specifically asserts that the limitations for example improperly prohibit necessary revisions to its transition plan and unreasonably restrict the specific content of proposal updates in areas where revisions are permitted the agency responds that its limitations on the scope of fpr revisions are reasonable and tailored to remedy the identified procurement improprieties in our office’s april   decision sustaining deloitte’s prior protest in part and are consistent with gao precedent regarding agency discretion to limit proposal revisions in the context of corrective actions  the agency contends that deloitte aims to update multiple aspects of its technical approach by using new key personnel to introduce new tools and techniques not presented in its prior proposal and to alter its transition approach  according to the agency deloitte should not be “allowed to augment its technical approach at this late stage thereby disregarding a reasonable corrective action tailored to correct a procurement impropriety”  agency report ar at  an agency’s discretion when taking corrective action extends to the scope of proposal revisions  see eg computer assocs int’l b‑ sept    cpd ¶  at  rel‑tek sys  design incmodification of remedy b‑ july    cpd ¶  at   as a general matter offerors in response to discussions may revise any aspect of their proposals as they see fit including portions of their proposals which were not subject to discussions  an agency in conducting discussions to implement corrective action may however reasonably limit the scope of revisions  system planning corp b‑ june    cpd ¶  at   where the corrective action does not also include amending the solicitation we will not question an agency’s decision to restrict proposal revisions when taking corrective action so long as it is reasonable in nature and remedies the established or suspected procurement impropriety  see consolidated eng’g servs inc b oct    cpd ¶  at  computer assocs int’l supra  in reviewing the reasonableness of an agency’s restrictions on proposal revisions in the context of discussions to implement corrective action we will consider whether the discussions and permitted revisions in response to discussions are expected to have a material impact on other areas of the offeror’s proposal  evergreen helicopters of alaska inc b‑ apr    cpd ¶  at  honeywell technology solutions inc b‑ nov    cpd ¶  at  see also reltek sys  design inc‑‑modification of remedy supra st aerospace engines pte ltd b oct    cpd ¶  at  we have reviewed the record here and as a general matter do not object to the agency’s decision to limit proposal revisions to areas in which our office identified improprieties in the prior award decision  however even where an agency is justified in restricting discussions responses in corrective action the agency may not prohibit offerors from revising related areas of their proposals which are materially impacted  whether these associated revisions may allow an offeror to further “augment its technical approach”as the agency asserts is deloitte’s intentionis not the appropriate test of whether such revisions must be permitted  rather as set forth above when assessing the reasonableness of an agency’s restrictions on proposal revisions we consider the extent to which the discussions and the permitted changes in response to discussions materially impact or are “inextricably linked” with other aspects of an offeror’s proposal  honeywell technology solutions inc supra in multiple prior protests concerning agency decisions to limit the scope of proposal revisions as part of corrective action our office has concluded that the limitations imposed were reasonable  in each of these cases we concluded that the permitted revisions in response to discussions would not impact other areas of the proposals in which revisions were prohibited  for instance in evergreen helicopters our office did not object to corrective action that limited fpr revisions to the addition of “performance data charts for the aircraft type and tail numbers proposed” and prohibited any other revisions  evergreen helicopters of alaska inc supra at   we concluded that the limited revisions were reasonable to correct informational deficiencies in the proposals that other aspects of the proposals such as pricing would not be impacted by discussions limited to additional performance data and that correction of informational deficiencies with respect to previouslyproposed aircraft therefore need not open the door for offerors to substitute entirely new aircraft similarly in honeywell technology solutions inc supra our office did not object to corrective action where the agency allowed offerors to revise their past performance proposals only  in that case we found that the limited revisions were reasonable to correct evaluation errors associated with two prior past performance evaluations  concerning the protester’s argument that the fpr limitations were unreasonably restrictive where other aspects of its proposal were “inextricably linked” to its past performance information we disagreed concluding that “honeywell has failed to establish that nasa’s decision permitting offerors to update their past performance information is expected to have a material impact on their cost or technical proposals”  id at   finally in reltek sys  design inc‑‑modification of remedy supra we did not object to corrective action which limited proposal revisions to three specific solicitation requirements concerning “acceptance warranty and software performance provisions” of the solicitation  id at   in that protest reltek argued that the corrective action was improper because it precluded reltek from changing areas of its proposal that the firm desired to change in order to be more competitive  our office concluded that the procurement improprieties and the corrective action involved separate aspects of the firm’s proposal and did not affect other portions of the proposal or requirements  we also specifically noted however that the limitations imposed by the agency did not prohibit the protester from revising other aspects of its proposal to the extent they related to the acceptance warranty and software performance provisions  our decision indicated as follows to the extent reltek contends that the limited best and final offer bafo request prejudices its chances for award since the firm cannot alter its cost proposal in other areas that may have included costs related to these three solicitation requirements we are not persuaded by this argumentrel‑tek has not shown that the terms of the bafo request are unnecessarily restrictive the agency’s bafo request limited to the offerors’ technical and costrelated proposal revisions for acceptance warranty and system performance did not prohibit revision to other areas of the offerors’ proposals to the extent that those proposal areas contained terms and related costs for the three requirements at issue id at  n emphasis added in contrast in the present protest we conclude that the corrective action to include discussions regarding key personnel does materially impact the protester’s technical proposal beyond the limited revisions permitted in the agency’s updated fpr instructions letter  on the record here the protester has established that the permitted key personnel substitutions broadly impact its proposal due to the differing qualifications capabilities and experience of the key personnel substitutions and their relative ability to perform the proposal as initially proposed  where the agency’s limitations on proposal revision prohibit such changes they are unreasonable  for example we agree with the protester that the fpr instructions as written unreasonably prohibit the protester from revising its transition plan which is materially impacted by the permitted key personnel substitutions  specifically the fpr instructions permit revisions to proposal sections beyond those of subfactor b “only to the extent that your initial proposal referenced your key personnel”  corrective action letter august   at   while deloitte’s transition plan as proposed did not directly address the transition of key personnel deloitte explains that its transition must nonetheless be revised because while its previouslyproposed key personnel were all deleted its substitute key personnel are deleted  as a consequence these new key personnel deleted  given that the agency’s proposal revision instructions preclude this change to a section of deloitte’s proposal that would be materially impacted by the permitted key personnel substitutions we conclude that the instruction’s limitations are unreasonably restrictive  we also agree with the protester that the instruction limiting the contents of revisions to “updating the names of key personnel as necessary and updating any accompanying qualification descriptions for such new key personnel” unreasonably restricts the protester from conforming areas of its technical proposal that directly reference key personnel who will be removed  for example deloitte explains and the record reflects that its prior proposal identified two key personnel‑‑its program manager and senior information architect architectureas also performing in non‑key roles as deleted in its transition approach  deloitte argues that these two individuals were selected based on prior experience deleted  both individuals are now to be replaced in deloitte’s fpr  because deloitte’s new senior information architect architecture does not have experience deleted deloitte proposes to replace its deleted with an individual who will not be designated as a key persona substitution which would be prohibited under a plain reading of the agency’s limitations on revisions since the new individual is not one of the “key personnel” finally we agree with the protester that the agency’s decision to limit proposal updates to “accompanying qualification descriptions” is unreasonably restrictive with respect to other skills and attributes of the key personnel that deloitte highlighted throughout its technical proposal  specifically deloitte explains that because the substitute key personnel do not share the same skills and experience which led deloitte to feature the prior key personnel in the other areas of its technical approach those aspects of the approach also require revision  in essence deloitte maintains that the required substitutions necessitate changes to its technical proposal beyond merely changing the qualification descriptions of the new key personnel  for example deloitte’s prior proposal presented multiple descriptions of its key personnel’s knowledge of various management practices and techniques which were presented as enhancements to and impact its approach to performance of technical subfactors outside of subfactor b  because deloitte’s substitute key personnel have different skills and experiencewith different deleted for instancewe agree that the permitted revisions should extend to revising references to substituted key personnel in deloitte’s technical approach as necessary to reflect the skills of its new personnel or to otherwise address the proposal content impacted by the removal of the prior key personnel in conclusion we find that the restrictions on proposal revisions imposed by the agency in connection with key personnel substitutions as part of the agency’s implementation of corrective action are unreasonably restrictive  the protester has demonstrated that due to the inherently different qualifications capabilities and experience of key personnel substitutions with respect to these individuals materially impact the protester’s proposal in a broad manner in ways that need to be revised beyond merely substituting names and resumes for the individuals to be replaced recommendation we find that the agency’s limitations on the scope of revisions in response to corrective action are unreasonably restrictive where the limitations prohibit the protester from revising all aspects of its technical approach that are materially impacted by the corrective action  we recommend that dha at a minimum amend its fpr instruction to permit offerors to revise all aspects of their technical proposals to the extent that the revisions relate to the permitted substitutions of key personnel and thereafter reevaluate the offerors’ revised technical proposals  we also recommend that deloitte be reimbursed the costs of filing and pursuing its protest including reasonable attorney’s fees   cfr § d  the protester should submit its certified claim for such costs detailing the time expended and costs incurred directly with the agency within  days of receiving this decision   cfr § f the protest is sustained susan a poling general counsel  the agency requested that our office dismiss deloitte’s protest as untimely arguing that deloitte knew or should have known the basis of its protest no later than may   we disagreed concluding that while deloitte had been advised that revisions would be limited to “key personnel information” the protester first learned that revisions to key personnel information would be limited to subfactor b in the may  cover letter  gao email on request for dismissal june    deloitte also alleges that the corrective action letter is ambiguous with respect to the “qualifications” of key personnel that may be revised  based on our conclusion below that the restriction on revisions to only the “qualifications” of key personnel is unreasonably restrictive and our recommendation that the fpr instructions be revised we conclude that this basis of deloitte’s protest is academic  we reached a different result in the protest of power connector inc b‑ aug    cpd ¶  in which we concluded that offerors should be permitted to make revisions to all aspects of their proposals in response to corrective action concerning an impropriety in the evaluation of past performance  however the corrective action in that case included the issuance of an amendment to the solicitation  where an agency amends the solicitation and permits offerors to revise their proposals our office has held that offerors should be permitted to revise any aspect of their proposalsincluding those that were not the subject of the amendmentunless the agency demonstrates that the amendment could not reasonably have an effect on the other aspects of the proposals or that allowing such revisions would have a detrimental impact on the competitive process  power connector inc supra cooperativa muratori riuniti b july    cpd ¶  at  lockheed martin sys integrationowego sikorsky aircraft co b b aug    cpd ¶  at   we conclude that this fact alonethat the agency in reltek expressed a limitation on the topical “areas” of proposals which could be revised without limitation to where in the proposals the revisions could reachsignificantly distinguishes the reasonable limitations described in reltek from the unreasonable limitations at issue in this protest  in briefing the agency expressed that it had no objection to the protester’s proposed revision of its deleted to include a new nonkey individual  however where a plain reading of the agency’s updated fpr instruction would prohibit such a revision we conclude that we must sustain the protest in this respect  deloitte explains that its replacements for deleted bring new skills and experience that redefine the prior approach to multiple aspects of performance  for example deloitte highlights the new deleted experience with deloitte’s deleted as new and different skills versus the prior key personnel which impact various areas of the technical approach in which the skills of the prior key personnel were discussed  protest at      concerning the agency’s disagreements with the protester over what aspects of the proposal “relate” to the permitted key personnel substitutionspreviewed in the agency’s report herewe conclude that a ruling on specific proposal revisions is premature at this time  to the extent that the agency declines to review certain revisions undertaken by the protester as “related” to the substitution of key personnel such a dispute concerns an evaluation challenge that would potentially form the basis of a subsequent protest with this

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans
