gene therapy in human trials our proprietary gene therapy candidate avxs has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of all types of spinal muscular atrophy sma and breakthrough therapy designation as well as fast track designation for the treatment of sma type —one of the most lifethreatening neurological genetic disorders decoding sma type  spinal muscular atrophy sma is a severe neuromuscular disease caused by a genetic defect in the smn gene—leading to the loss of motor neurons and resulting in progressive muscle weakness and paralysis sma is divided into subcategories—sma types    and —based on disease onset and severity which generally correlate to survival motor neuron smn protein levels our primary focus is to develop gene therapies for sma initially targeting sma type  and then progressively moving to other sma subtypes heres why were targeting type  first  of sma patients have type  with observation of disease symptoms within six months of birth the number one genetic cause of infant death is sma type  years life expectancy of a child with sma type  the goal of avxs we believe gene therapy is a wellsuited approach for the treatment of sma due to the monogenic nature of the disease—meaning its caused by the deletion of or mutations in a single gene avxs is our clinicalstage proprietary gene therapy candidate of a onetime intravenous treatment for sma type —designed to prevent further muscle degeneration caused by sma through delivery of a fully functional human smn gene into target motor neuron cells production of sufficient levels of smn protein required to improve motor neuron function rapid onset of effect in addition to sustained smn protein expression    key elements of avxs discover the components that make avxs an optimal gene therapy approach   recombinant aav capsid shell a nonreplicating adenoassociated virus aav capsid is used to deliver a functional copy of a human smn gene to the patients own cells without modifying the existing dna of the patient unlike many other capsids the aav capsid utilized in avxs crosses the bloodbrain barrier—a tight protective barrier that regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain—allowing the option of intravenous administration aav has been observed in preclinical studies to efficiently target motor neuron cells when delivered via either intrathecal or intravenous administration the dna contained within the capsid shell is engineered to contain the other three critical elements of avxs   human smn transgene a stable fully functioning human smn gene that’s introduced into the nucleus of the patients cells is meant to supplement the cells production of the smn protein avxs aims to introduce a fully functional smn gene to increase the patients production of smn protein to an adequate level   scaav itr  selfcomplementary dna technology the human smn transgene is introduced as a selfcomplementary sc doublestranded molecule the inclusion of this technology enables rapid onset of effect typically a singlestranded aav vector must wait for cellmediated synthesis of its complementary dna strand to form the doublestranded dna unit that’s required for transcription and subsequent protein synthesis the selfcomplementary modification to an inverted terminal repeat itr overcomes this ratelimiting step of cellmediated secondstrand synthesis   continuous promoter  this unit activates the transgene and is designed to allow for continuous and sustained smn expression the cytomegalovirus enhanced chicken betaactin hybrid promoter that we utilize is a constitutive or “always on” promoter that has been observed to increase transgene expression from aav vectors compared to other promoters phase  trial the openlabel study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of avxs in patients suffering from sma type  the primary outcome in the study is safety and tolerability the secondary outcome measure is an efficacy measure as defined by the time from birth to an “event” which is defined as death or at least  hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for  consecutive days in the absence of acute

discuss alignment with the us food and drug administration fda on the company’s good manufacturing practice gmp commercial manufacturing process for avxs following the receipt of minutes from the type b chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc meeting avexis inc announces alignment with fda on gmp commercial manufacturing process for avxs jun   avexis inc announced alignment with the us food and drug administration fda on the company’s good manufacturing practice gmp commercial manufacturing process for avxs following the receipt of minutes from the type b chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc meeting this alignment includes support for the proposed commercial manufacturing process the proposed analytical methods and corresponding qualification and validation plans – inclusive of key release assays such as potency purity and identity – and the proposed comparability protocol which helps assess how similar the product derived from the gmp process is to the original product used in the phase  trial of avxs in patients with spinal muscular atrophy sma type  key components of the scalable gmp commercial manufacturing process are as follows avexis will continue to utilize hek cells and an adherent cell line the commercialscale gmp process will not include the use of hyperstacks for aav vector production the company has instead identified a novel adherent cell culture approach that can more reliably produce product and has greater surface area to potentially increase productivity relative to hyperstacks additional process development improvements both up and downstream were implemented to meet global regulatory gmp expectations as well as to meet projected global patient demand avexis plans to use the gmp process for all clinical and commercial needs moving forward including the company’s new rett and als programs overall the company believes there is alignment with the fda on its panel of analytical methods and the proposed assay qualificationvalidation plans analytical methods are used to assess how reliably and consistently the key product characteristics can be determined in order to ensure patients receive safe and effective product in the meeting minutes the fda made a request that the company complete implementation of its potency assay qualification plan presented in the meeting prior to initiation of upcoming clinical studies this assay utilizes the delta  mouse model which has been used historically to assess avxs potency but now incorporates additional elements to make it acceptable to global regulatory authorities the company has already initiated the work necessary to address this request and expects to have the data ready to submit to the fda in the august timeframe avexis plans to initiate a pivotal study trial of avxs in sma type  in the us and a phase a trial of avxs in sma type  in the us later in the third quarter of  pending agreement from the fda that these data are sufficient additionally fda is aligned with the company’s proposed comparability protocol to assess the similarity of key characteristics of the nationwide children’s hospital nch product used in the phase  sma type  study with the product derived from the new gmp manufacturing process data from this comparability work is ongoing and will include the abovementioned potency qualification data which will be incorporated into the data package along with the full phase  clinical data that will be reviewed and discussed at the upcoming endofphase  meeting likely to be requested later in august this meeting will help further inform the regulatory pathway options for avxs the company anticipates providing an update on the outcome of that meeting once the official minutes are available which is anticipated to be in the fourth quarter of  the company has previously stated that having its own manufacturing facility is a key strategic capability necessary to be successful in gene therapy the company reported that the avexis manufacturing facility is now fully operational for ongoing gmp production product for the planned sma type  pivotal trials and the type  phase a trial using intrathecal delivery has been produced at the avexisowned facility and will be used to initiate the trials pending fda review of the potency assay qualification described above and fda agreement that designated batches of the product are appropriate for a phase  clinical study the avexis facility will be the primary production site to meet projected commercial demand and the company will use contract manufacturing organizations to

by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next

sma type  which is a genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration the survival motor neuron smn is a protein for normal motor neuron signaling and function patients with sma type  either have experienced a deletion of their smn genes which prevents them from producing adequate levels of functional smn protein or carry a mutation in their smn gene avxs is

from new process – –  avexis manufacturing facility is fully operational for gmp product production – – conference call and webcast today at  pm edt – chicago june   globe newswire  avexis inc nasdaqavxs a clinicalstage gene therapy company developing treatments for patients suffering from rare and lifethreatening neurological genetic diseases today announced alignment with the us food and drug administration fda on the company’s good manufacturing practice gmp commercial manufacturing process for avxs following the receipt of minutes from the type b chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc meeting this alignment includes support for the proposed commercial manufacturing process the proposed analytical methods and corresponding qualification and validation plans – inclusive of key release assays such as potency purity and identity – and the proposed comparability protocol which helps assess how similar the product derived from the gmp process is to the original product used in the phase  trial of avxs in patients with spinal muscular atrophy sma type  key components of the scalable gmp commercial manufacturing process are as follows avexis will continue to utilize hek cells and an adherent cell linethe commercialscale gmp process will not include the use of hyperstacks for aav vector productionthe company has instead identified a novel adherent cell culture approach that can more reliably produce product and has greater surface area to potentially increase productivity relative to hyperstacksadditional process development improvements both up and downstream were implemented to meet global regulatory gmp expectations as well as to meet projected global patient demandavexis plans to use the gmp process for all clinical and commercial needs moving forward including the company’s new rett and als programs overall the company believes there is alignment with the fda on its panel of analytical methods and the proposed assay qualificationvalidation plans analytical methods are used to assess how reliably and consistently the key product characteristics can be determined in order to ensure patients receive safe and effective product in the meeting minutes the fda made a request that the company complete implementation of its potency assay qualification plan presented in the meeting prior to initiation of upcoming clinical studies this assay utilizes the delta  mouse model which has been used historically to assess avxs potency but now incorporates additional elements to make it acceptable to global regulatory authorities specifically the agency stated “we believe that your potency assay development and qualification plans have the potential to result in an acceptable potency assay and we are encouraged that the assay includes reference controls that allow for calculation of relative potency and that the assay qualification will include  independent runs however we do not have enough information to predict the feasibility of your plans” the company has already initiated the work necessary to address this request and expects to have the data ready to submit to the fda in the august timeframe avexis plans to initiate a pivotal study trial of avxs in sma type  in the us and a phase a trial of avxs in sma type  in the us later in the third quarter of  pending agreement from the fda that these data are sufficient “the goal of the cmc meeting was to align with fda on our commercial manufacturing process analytical methods and comparability protocol all three of which we believe were achieved in this collaborative and constructive discussion” said sean nolan president and chief executive officer of avexis “the team has already made progress toward addressing the fda’s request regarding potency assay qualification and we anticipate only a modest impact to timelines we are pleased with the outcomes of the meeting and the progress we have made at the avexis facility and most importantly believe we have a scalable gmp commercial process in place to fulfill future patient demand and a path forward to potentially utilize the phase  data in our regulatory pathway” additionally fda is aligned with the company’s proposed comparability protocol to assess the similarity of key characteristics of the nationwide children’s hospital nch product used in the phase  sma type  study with the product derived from the new gmp manufacturing process data from this comparability work is ongoing and will include the abovementioned potency qualification data which will be incorporated into the data package along with the full phase  clinical data that will be reviewed and discussed at the upcoming endofphase  meeting likely to be requested later in august this meeting will help further inform the regulatory pathway options for avxs the company anticipates providing an update on the outcome of that meeting once the official minutes are available which is anticipated to be in the fourth quarter of  the company has previously stated that having its own manufacturing facility is a key strategic capability necessary to be successful in gene therapy the company today reported that the avexis manufacturing facility is now fully operational for ongoing gmp production product for the planned sma type  pivotal trials and the type  phase a trial using intrathecal delivery has been produced at the avexisowned facility and will be used to initiate the trials pending fda review of the potency assay qualification described above and fda agreement that designated batches of the product are appropriate for a phase  clinical studythe avexis facility will be the primary production site to meet projected commercial demand and the company will use contract manufacturing
