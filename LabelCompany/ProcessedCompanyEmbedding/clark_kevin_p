prediction that the company would earn its first quarterly profitone cent per share on november  critical path issued a press release reiterating that guidance rinehart and others conclude that critical path will not meet its fourth quarter goals  by the final week of december  however rinehart and others at critical path concluded the company would not achieve the revenue and earnings goals the company had announced critical paths president told rinehart to get approximately  million in back pocket deals meaning fictitious sales that would be recorded as revenue only if needed the president also told rinehart that when the purported customers failed to pay critical path could use its bad debt reserve to absorb the losses  generally accepted accounting principles in particular aicpa statement of position  required that critical path satisfy the following four criteria prior to recognizing revenue on the sale of its software i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii the vendors fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable with the delivery criterion in mind on december   the president emailed rinehart make sure that any deals which may be completed after year end have had software shipped before year end rinehart relayed this instruction to beck clark and other sales managers at rineharts instruction clark and other salesmen arrange a  million fictitious sale  rinehart and other critical path sales personnel including beck and clark implemented the plan to get back pocket deals on or about december   clark and another critical path salesman called a former employeewho was working for a ticket brokerage firmto ask him to sign a product evaluation agreement to help critical path with its yearend numbers clark assured the former employee that the agreement would expire in thirty days and that there was a  percent chance that critical path would not need to use it but on or about january   clark and another salesman met the former employee at a bar and arranged for him to signand backdate to december  a software license agreement ostensibly committing the ticket brokerage firm to pay critical path approximately  million rinehart signed the software license agreement on behalf of critical path in fact neither party ever intended to honor the contract and rinehart and clark knew this  on or before january   beck learned that critical path had entered into a sham  million software license agreement with the ticket brokerage firm referred to in paragraph  above  when critical path

latedecember  rinehart beck and another critical path salesman arranged a fictitious transaction with a nearbankrupt internet shopping provider rinehart had a critical path salesman contact a former colleague who now worked for the internet shopping provider the former colleague agreed toevaluate critical path software but warned the critical path salesman that under no circumstance would his company purchase the product beck knew that rineharts purpose in instructing the sales force to prepare evaluation agreements and ship software before yearend was to further the scheme to improperly record revenue in the fourth quarter  following rineharts instruction on or about december   beck directed the other critical path salesman to prepare a nonbinding software evaluation agreement between critical path and the internet shopping provider on or about january   rinehart told beck and the other critical path salesman to prepare a software license agreement for the internet shopping provider and that critical path would record revenuein the fourth quarter for the transaction the other salesman forged the signature of the internet shopping provider employee on the agreement ostensibly committing the company to pay critical path  million rinehart signed the software license agreement on behalf of critical path neither critical path nor the internet shopping provider ever intended to honor the contract and rinehart beck and others at critical path knew this beck understood thatas part of the deceptionthe deal with the internet shopping provider would be written off as bad debt during the first quarter   when critical path initially announced its fourth quarter results in january  it included in revenue the  million recorded for the fictitious software license agreement with the internet shopping provider in april  after completing an internal investigation and its annual audit critical path permanently reversed this revenue rinehart and other salesmen arrange a backdated  million contract that was subject to material conditions  in january  critical path salesmen were attempting to sell software to a company that provides internet access to schools

authorization rinehart issued side letters to the customer on behalf of critical path one of the letters stated that the agreement was subject to veto and termination at the sole discretion of the customer the other extended the payment terms and stated that if the customer determines in its sole discretion that adequate funding is not available the project would terminate and the customer would owe no additional money to critical path the  million contract signed by the customer on or about january   was backdated to december   when critical path initially announced its fourth quarter results in january  it included in revenue the  million recorded for the purported software license agreement with the provider of internet access to schools in april  after completing an internal investigation and its annual audit critical path permanently reversed this revenue clark arranges for a sales agreement to be backdated  in late december  clark concluded that he would not be able to close before the end of the year a sale he was negotiatingworth with a company that created and operated entertainment web sites heeding rineharts instructionthat deals not concluded until january could still be counted as revenue in the fourth quarter if critical path shipped software to the customer before yearendclark shipped software to the prospective customer in december in early january  the customer agreed to purchase the software to enable critical path to include revenue from this sale in its fourth quarter  results clark directed a subordinate to backdate the contract to december  critical path included this sale in the fourth quarter results it initially announced rinehart signed the software license agreement on behalf of critical path in april  after completing the internal investigation and annual audit critical path removed the transaction from its fourth quarter results and included it in its first quarter  results rinehart misleads critical paths auditors  on january   rinehart signed a management representationletter to critical paths auditors it contained the following statements that rinehart knew were false there are no side letters or oral agreements with customers that would modify or supersede the terms of the purchase orders andor contracts with these customers the companys customers have not been granted any rights to return products or extended payment terms no matters or occurrences have come to my attention during the yearended december   and through the date of this letter that would materially affect the recognition of revenue    in the

clark sold  shares of critical path stock for proceeds of  beck and clark sold these shares at least in part because they knew that the company had recorded a material amount of revenue in the fourth quarter from backdated and fictitious software license agreements and that if the market learned of critical paths true financial results the companys stock price would fall  beck and clark also knew the companys blackout rules did not permit them to sell company stock when they did on november   all critical path employees had received an email from the companys stock administrator saying that the trading window for group ab insiders which beck and clark knew included sales managers like themselves would be closed from december   until the close of business on the second day following the
