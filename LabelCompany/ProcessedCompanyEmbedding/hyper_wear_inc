wringing the excess water out in a towel and laying the vest flat in a cool dry place to dry completely you do not need to remove the weights for this you can also wash the vest in the washing machine using a delicate cycle then lay flat to dry be sure to remove all the weights before putting weight vest in washing machine is the hyper vest pro durable yes the hyper vest pro weight vest is

blog  mastering murph mastering murph may th  memorial day is just a few days away and while most ordinary americans will be relaxing at barbecues eating hot dogs and enjoying a lazy day off many in the crossfit community will spend it in the gym in pain murph wod   the reason for their pain murph murph is a crossfit workout that honors navy lt michael murphy who was killed in action in afghanistan in  in crossfit a fitness system known for its nononsense workouts murph is considered one of its most brutal it is a timed workout that starts with a onemile run followed by  pullups  pushups and  squats and finished off with another onemile run lt murphy created the workout himself and originally christened it “body armor” because he did it wearing his  lb tactical body armor oh yeah and did i mention it is supposed to be done wearing a  lb weight vest while it is simple in design it is anything but in execution the sheer volume of reps is daunting any one part by itself would be a tough workout put them all together throw on a weight vest race the stopwatch and you have yourself one serious trip to the pain cave this memorial day i will attempt my first murph as a noncrossfitter and murph virgin i asked x crossfit games athlete julie foucher for some survival tips julie foucher using her hyper vest pro weight vest for murph wod   hw will you be tackling murph this memorial day julie absolutely i do it every year on memorial day and it’s always a highlight hw how many times have you performed it in the past julie according to my results in beyond the whiteboard i’ve done murph eight times since starting crossfit in june of  hw what is your best time julie my best time with a vest was  min  seconds in  and without a vest was  in  to put that into perspective anything around  minutes is in the elite category hw do you wear a weight vest julie yes i usually wear my hyper vest pro i have done it both with and without in the past hw what is your strategy for completing it how do you break up your rounds julie when wearing a vest i usually do sets of  without the vest sometimes i will do  until i am done with my pullups and then  more sets of  hw do you take rest breaks in between or just go straight through julie i go straight through as much as i can although i often have to break up the pushup sets julie foucher doing push ups in weight vest   hw with only a few weeks to go what do you recommend for trainingpractice leading up to the day julie i recommend adding more of the murph movements to your workouts try different variations of the workout for example  rounds of  m run  pullups  pushups  squats you might also want to start wearing your weight vest in some workouts too hw do you have any good hydrationnutrition tips julie if i am doing a long workout especially in high heat and humidity i will add some electrolyte tabs to my water or make sure i recover with a drink like formula o hw what’s the best advice you can give a st timer julie my best advice for a first timer is to just keep moving this workout is much more difficult mentally than physically at times it may seem as if you are hardly making progress but if you just keep moving forward one rep at a time you will get there as with all hero workouts focus your mind on individuals like lt michael p murphy who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country and our freedom i have been taking julie’s advice in my training using  pullup pushup squat rounds and it has been working pretty good i have also been splitting my training doing some with and some without a weight vest i plan on attempting the murph wearing my hyper vest pro and will see how far i get hopefully i can just muscle through and complete it as julie said just keep chipping away one rep at a time how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time good luck to everyone participating in this year’s murph and if you are looking for a weight vest to wear check out the hyper vest pro the best
