dividend income and longterm capital growth primarily through investments in stocks strategy the fund will normally invest at least  of its total assets in stocks with an emphasis on stocks that have a strong track record of paying dividends or that are expected to increase their dividends over time t rowe price believes that a track record of dividend increases is an excellent indicator of financial health and growth prospects and that over the long term income can contribute significantly to total return dividends can also help reduce the funds volatility during periods of market turbulence and help offset losses when stock prices are falling riskreward potential click on the riskreward spectrum below to view the funds in that category higher moderate lower the fund seeks investments that will allow its dividend growth rate to exceed the inflation rate and that can also provide capital appreciation while a companys stock price can go up or down in response to earnings or market fluctuations dividends the second component of a funds total return are usually more reliable therefore dividendpaying stocks generally are less volatile than those paying belowaverage dividends or none at allthe funds emphasis on dividendpaying companies could result in significant investments in largecapitalization stocks at times largecap stocks may lag shares of smaller fastergrowing companies also a company may reduce or eliminate its dividend the funds efforts to buy stocks that appear temporarily out of favor carry the risk that a stock or group of stocks may remain out of favor for a long time and may continue to decline this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a

substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of returns a measure of price volatility is one measure of risk please consult the funds prospectuses for a more
