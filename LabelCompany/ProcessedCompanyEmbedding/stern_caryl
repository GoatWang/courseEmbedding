corner office by adam bryant april   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview with caryl m stern president and chief executive of the us fund for unicef was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq do you remember the first time you were somebody’s bossa my first real job where i supervised people was right after graduate school i worked for northwestern university and helped run its noncredit continuing education program i was the director of it and it was a really fun job — a little bit like herding cats because i had to hire all of these people to teach who didn’t normally teachi hired the best artists in town to teach painting classes and all the best musicians to teach music classes i hired a bunch of chefs to teach cooking classes when i took over the program it was about  or  courses by the time i left about two and a half years later it was closer to  coursesq was that an easy transition for you into that kind of rolea at that point in my life it never dawned on me i couldn’t do something i was  it was fun i would go to bars and listen to bands and figure out which would be the best one to teach a course on how you get your band into a bar so by the time saturday night rolled around and i’d walk into any club i knew every musician i knew artists and i knew athletes it never dawned on me that i couldn’t get access to somebody advertisement continue reading the main story q what about in collegea i went to westchester community college where i ended up in a theater group that experience exposed me to a whole new world continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q were you on stage or behind the stagea i was the costume designer on a couple of shows and then i had the lead in a couple of shows too but then i went more into the costume design side and ultimately decided i really liked the artwork and became an art majorq you’re one of several ceo’s i’ve interviewed with a background in theater a i’m not surprised you need to be able to get up and deliver the good news and the bad news it’s just that same feeling before you go on stage and you take that deep breath in my organization now with several hundred people working for me i have to be that policeman and that show leader at the same time so what better training is thereq what were some early leadership lessons for youa i was hired as a dean at polytechnic university in new yorkwhen i was  years old and i didn’t know when i was hired that i was the first woman dean they’d ever had i went into that job thinking i had to be one of the boys and act like the boys somewhere in there i learned that if i just stopped trying to be something i wasn’t they were either going to like me or not and that would be ok but the “like me or not” part of it was a big thing for me to learni think i’m a good leader now and i do a decent job of running my organization and a big part of that is because i’ve gotten past that lesson i am who i am and what you see is what you get i speak up i say what i think i tell the people who work for me when i hire them “if you work for me you’re going to hear what i’m thinking you can push back and i’m going to listen when you push back” my staff doesn’t have to worry “is she angry is she happy is she contemplating” they know where they stand they know what i want they know what makes me happy i know what they want you don’t have to like me it’s okq when you came to the us fund for unicef four years ago what were your goals in terms of building the culturea it was a very interesting time in my life i’ve taught leadership development at manhattanville college so it was a chance to take all of this textbook learning and actually apply it can you do it can you really have a work team and i’ve never worked with a better team than i’m working with right now and i’ve never worked in an environment as energized as the one i’m working in right nowand that didn’t happen by chance we hired coaches to help make that happen we wrote values to help make that happen we decided we wanted to be the nonprofit you’d want to work for we had a staff retreat and we did a blowup of a magazine cover with the senior management team on it that said “us fund for unicef named charity of the year five years out” and we spent a weekend holed up in a hotel and we wrote the article if we were going to be named five years from now the charity of the year why what would we have done what would we have accomplished and we spent a lot of time on that but also what would we be internally what would it feel like what would you as an employee expect what would i as a boss want from you what’s the environment so it wasn’t only about what will we achieve but how are we going to get there photo caryl m stern the president and chief executive of the us fund for unicef says that her background in the theater has also helped her as a leader because “you need to be able to get up and deliver good news and bad news” credit earl wilsonthe new york times q what other steps did you takea we hired a coach who worked with us collectively but also coached us individually about process — not skills process he actually took us through the process of learning how to work together and it was the most phenomenal thing i’ve ever been a part of advertisement continue reading the main story we have an entire team really working together now so the sum is so much greater than its parts i’ve never sat at a management table before where people will say “well my division really needs this but i think your division’s needs are bigger so i’m going to put mine off to the side” i’m not describing utopia it’s a competitive environment but there is a sense of trust and a bond within this group newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you must select a

your lesson to other organizations trying to do something similara you have to take time to get to know each other — not to be friends necessarily if you end up as friends that’s great but i need to understand what you need to work and you need to understand what i need to work if i understand that time has no meaning for you and time has a lot of meaning for me then we’d better negotiate how we’re going to handle that and oftentimes in management experiences we don’t have those discussions so you come late to meetings i show up on time the meeting now starts  minutes late i’m angry you’re angry and this is how we’re going to do our best work no this doesn’t really work so i need to sit down and negotiate with youbut we are going to honor that the six people on our team are the most important six people to each other so that means if you expect something from me by  o’clock you’re going to get it you have to be able to do your work all day and not worry about whether that’s going to be in your inbox by  and the moment you have to worry about it the team doesn’t workq what were some other changes you made early ona as a new ceo i had breakfast with every single staff person over the course of the first six months and then i said to every boss every senior employee “i want your brightest and your best give me a list who are your brightest and your best” i didn’t tell them how many names they all gave me their lists and i said “ok you’ve got one year at the end of the year either everyone working for you is on this list or you’re telling me how you’re getting them there or you’re getting rid of them if we are going to attract the brightest and the best then we’ve got to keep only the brightest and the best”that was one thing we changed immediately some people were really good at what they did but they were really difficult to work with they’re all gone i can teach people skills i can’t teach them how to play in the sandboxq what else did you doa we wrote corporate values as an organization we had never had them before from the security guard at the front door to me everybody participated in that exercise which took several weeks we all committed to them we printed them and put them on everyone’s desk we changed the evaluation forms so you are not only measured on your productivity and performance but on how you workyou could be the best fundraiser in the world but if i’m hearing from your colleagues or your boss or those who work for you that you don’t treat others respectfully that you are dismissive then you’re not going to work for meq you’ve thought a lot about the culture you want to createa the driving motivator behind the workplace i’m trying to create right now is the living proof that the fear factor does not have to be the motivation you can work in a place and do your best work because you so believe in the cause and because you’re so valued not because you are always looking for a raise and not because you’re afraid of being fired but because you truly buy in and really want to succeed i have to be the kind of boss who creates that environment and i do believe it starts with me advertisement continue reading the main story q how do you hire what are you looking for and what questions do you ask if you were interviewing me for a job how would that conversation goa i’d want you to describe to me not what your management style is not how you’re going to supervise but how you work in a team what’s your role in a team what do you usually do how good are you at giving feedback how good are you at hearing feedback can you work for someone who’s going to give it to you between the eyes and is going to expect it backq what else do you ask about a i want to get a sense of what your needs are from me what makes a workplace good for you again i’m interested in the how not just the what i want to know who you are i want to know what makes you tick i want to understand how you’re going to fit into the circle of this groupq what other questionsa i will ask you so tell me about your career what’s the thing that you’re most proud of why are you most proud of it what do you think is the greatest challenge you ever faced before and how did you resolve it do you ask for help do you offer help give me an example of a time you offered help where it wasn’t your job to help but you did it anyway do you volunteer anywhere have you ever volunteered anywhere what are you passionate about what do you do with your free timeq and if you could only ask somebody a couple of questionsa give me an example of a team you’ve been a part of and when you’re really stressed out at work what do you do how do you handle it what’s your coping mechanism that really tells me a whole lot about you  continue
