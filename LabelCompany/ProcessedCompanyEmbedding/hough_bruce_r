  twitter about help center terms privacy policy cookies ads info bruce r hough sunday december   being grateful a year around state of being the following article published just for thanksgiving was of particular interest to me because the author begins his article relating his experience being in barcelona for thanksgiving  years ago this year my wife and i traveled to barcelona on thanksgiving to spend the extended holiday weekend with our youngest daughter her husband and our newest grandchild  becoming empty nesters recently we felt we could abandon our other grown children to their own thanksgiving traditions and embark on a little adventure of our own  we loved barcelona and its many sites and offerings and especially spending time with our family there but i also appreciated the authors explanation of the idea that gratitude as a choice  too many of us allow circumstances and others to determine our attitude and disposition  but choosing to be grateful is not just some pop psychology puffery it is real so real in fact that science has even documented how our choice to act a certain way will in fact change our disposition to be that certain way   i hope you enjoy the article and most of all i hope we can have an attitude of gratitude in all we do and say  it can actually be contagious   enjoy the wonderful season of family and friendships and giving to others  the gift of gratitude may be one of the finest gifts we can give  brh choose to be grateful it will make you happier nov    arthur c brooks  twentyfour years ago this month my wife and i married in barcelona spain two weeks after our wedding flush with international idealism i had the bright idea of sharing a bit of american culture with my spanish inlaws by cooking a full thanksgiving dinner easier said than done turkeys are not common in barcelona the local butcher shop had to order the bird from a specialty farm in france and it came only partially plucked our tiny oven was too small for the turkey no one had ever heard of cranberries over dinner my new family had many queries some were practical such as “what does this beast eat to be so filled with bread” but others were philosophical “should you celebrate this holiday even if you don’t feel grateful” i stumbled over this last question at the time i believed one should feel grateful in order to give thanks to do anything else seemed somehow dishonest or fake — a kind of bourgeois saccharine insincerity that one should reject it’s best to be emotionally authentic right wrong building the best life does not require fealty to feelings in the name of authenticity but rather rebelling against negative impulses and acting right even when we don’t feel like it in a nutshell acting grateful can actually make you grateful for many people gratitude is difficult because life is difficult even beyond deprivation and depression there are many ordinary circumstances in which gratitude doesn’t come easily this point will elicit a knowing mirthless chuckle from readers whose thanksgiving dinners are usually ruined by a drunk uncle who always needs to share his political views thanks for nothing beyond rotten circumstances some people are just naturally more grateful than others a  article in the journal social cognitive and affective neuroscience identified a variation in a gene cd associated with gratitude some people simply have a heightened genetic tendency to experience in the researchers’ words “global relationship satisfaction perceived partner responsiveness and positive emotions particularly love” that is those relentlessly positive people you know who seem grateful all the time may simply be mutants but we are more than slaves to our feelings circumstances and genes evidence suggests that we can actively choose to practice gratitude — and that doing so raises our happiness this is not just selfimprovement hokum for example researchers in one  study randomly assigned one group of study participants to keep a short weekly list of the things they were grateful for while other groups listed hassles or neutral events ten weeks later the first group enjoyed significantly greater life satisfaction than the others other studies have shown the same pattern and lead to the same conclusion if you want a truly happy holiday choose to keep the “thanks” in thanksgiving whether you feel like it or not how does all this work one explanation is that acting happy regardless of feelings coaxes one’s brain into processing positive emotions in one famous  experiment researchers asked human subjects to smile forcibly for  seconds while tensing facial muscles notably the muscles around the eyes called the orbicularis oculi which create “crow’s feet” they found that this action stimulated brain activity associated with positive emotions if grinning for an uncomfortably long time like a scary lunatic isn’t your cup of tea try expressing gratitude instead according to research published in the journal cerebral cortex gratitude stimulates the hypothalamus a key part of the brain that regulates stress and the ventral tegmental area part of our “reward circuitry” that produces the sensation of pleasure it’s science but also common sense choosing to focus on good things makes you feel better than focusing on bad things as my teenage kids would say “thank you captain obvious” in the slightly more elegant language of the stoic philosopher epictetus “he is a man of sense who does not grieve for what he has not but rejoices in what he has” in addition to building our own happiness choosing gratitude can also bring out the best in those around us researchers at the university of southern california showed this in a  study of people with high power but low emotional security think of the worst boss you’ve ever had the research demonstrated that when their competence was questioned the subjects tended to lash out with aggression and personal denigration when shown gratitude however they reduced the bad behavior that is the best way to disarm an angry interlocutor is with a warm “thank you” i learned this lesson  years ago at the time i was an academic social scientist toiling in professorial obscurity writing technical articles and books that would be read by a few dozen people at most soon after securing tenure however i published a book about charitable giving that to my utter befuddlement gained a popular audience overnight i started receiving feedback from total strangers who had seen me on television or heard me on the radio one afternoon i received an unsolicited email “dear professor brooks” it began “you are a fraud” that seemed pretty unpromising but i read on anyway my correspondent made in brutal detail a case against every chapter of my book as i made my way through the long email however my dominant thought wasn’t resentment it was “he read my book” and so i wrote him back — rebutting a few of his points but mostly just expressing gratitude for his time and attention i felt good writing it and his nearimmediate response came with a warm and friendly tone does expressing gratitude have any downside actually it might there is some research suggesting it could make you fat a new study in the journal of consumer psychology finds evidence that people begin to crave sweets when they are asked to express gratitude if this finding holds up we might call it the pumpkin pie paradox the costs to your weight notwithstanding the prescription for all of us is clear make gratitude a routine independent of how you feel — and not just once each november but all year long there are concrete strategies that each of us can adopt first start with “interior gratitude” the practice of giving thanks privately having a job that involves giving frequent speeches — not always to friendly audiences — i have tried to adopt the mantra in my own work of being grateful to the people who come to see me next move to “exterior gratitude” which focuses on public expression the psychologist martin seligman father of the field known as “positive psychology” gives some practical suggestions on how to do this in his best seller “authentic happiness” he recommends that readers systematically express gratitude in letters to loved ones and colleagues a disciplined way to put this into practice is to make it as routine as morning coffee write two short emails each morning to friends family or colleagues thanking them for what they do saint benedict would approve finally be grateful for useless things it is relatively easy to be thankful for the most important and obvious parts of life — a happy marriage healthy kids or living in america but truly happy people find ways to give thanks for the little insignificant trifles ponder the impractical joy in gerard manley hopkins’s poem “pied beauty” glory be to god for dappled things — for skies of couplecolour as a brinded cow for rosemoles all in stipple upon trout that swim freshfirecoal chestnutfalls finches’ wings landscape plotted and pieced — fold fallow and plough and all trades their gear and tackle and trim be honest when was the last time you were grateful for the spots on a trout more seriously think of the small useless things you experience — the smell of fall in the air the fragment of a song that reminds you of when you were a kid give thanks this thanksgiving don’t express gratitude only when you feel it give thanks especially when you don’t feel it rebel against the emotional “authenticity” that holds you back from your bliss as for me i am taking my own advice and updating my gratitude list it includes my family faith friends and work but also the dappled complexion of my breadpacked bird and it includes

politics  the deseret news did a fine job in the following article describing her public persona  it is a wonderful tribute to honor her for a viewing at the utah state capitol this afternoon and evening   my personal sympathies and prayers are extended to the walker family  brh    deseret news article link salt lake city — olene walker the only woman to serve as utahs governor died saturday due to causes incident to age she was  in her eight years as a legislator  years as the state’s secondincommand and  days as governor walker developed a reputation as a trailblazing lawmaker who led with grit and charisma i honestly dont know of a single person who does not have a high regard for her said former gov mike leavitt who recruited her as his running mate in  thats a tribute to the tone of her personality the genuineness of her concern — she was a friend to everybody but especially the downtrodden on saturday gov gary herbert authorized flags to be lowered to halfstaff until sunset thursday on behalf of all utahns we express our gratitude for the sacrifice and leadership of one of utahs finest public servants herbert said in a statement a number of utah political leaders also released statements about walker on saturday including former governor jon huntsman jr members of utahs congressional delegation and utah state senate president wayne niederhauser in a statement sen orrin hatch said walker truly paved the way for women in government in utah throughout her life she displayed great integrity determination strength and wisdom hatch said colleagues remembered walker who served as governor from nov   to jan   as approachable and kind and possessed of limitless energy despite assuming office in her mids — the oldest governor in the nation at the time while in office she championed education and wasnt afraid of stirring up the legislature to do so walker gained the wrath of some conservatives when she vetoed an early effort at vouchers for private schools she sparred with legislators again over an early reading program threatening to veto the state budget proposal unless lawmakers came up with funding for it — which they did her pragmatism humility and sense of humor made her wellrespected on both sides of the aisle “even though i was a democrat it didn’t matter” said meghan holbrook the former chairwoman of the state democratic party “she was strategic she was smart she was witty she was tough she did politics with grace and compassion and great good will — all in high heels” walker left office with an  percent approval rating walker assumed the role of governor after leavitt resigned to head the environmental protection agency in  prior to that she served as lieutenant governor for a decade — the longest tenure of any lieutenant governor in utah walker had a rural charm that led some colleagues in the legislature to refer to her as aunt bea a reference to a motherly character in the s andy griffith tv show we had a joke she and i said carol mcnamara the director of the olene s walker institute of politics  public service at weber state university she would tell me about someone and she would say she’s a good friend of mine’ and then she would realize that she says that all the time and my response was always that i think it’s true — she had more good friends and she inspired so much admiration and respect across the political spectrum in utah walker was a utah woman through and through raised on a farm in weber county the girl who grew up milking cows thinning sugar beets and hauling hay went on to earn a master’s degree from stanford university and a doctorate from the university of utah friends said that even as lieutenant governor walker was so humble she refused to use the driver offered to her holbrook recalled seeing walker walking down the street toward the little america hotel where she was supposed to give a speech “i said ‘what are you doing lieutenant governor’ and she said ‘my car has a flat tire and i didn’t want to call the highway patrol so will you give me a ride’” said holbrook laughing and that was so her before her political career walker was a homemaker a mother of seven children and a partner in her husband myron’s successful snack food business even then she was known for being a tireless worker as a public servant walker was known to work hour days and joked that she dried her hair by sticking her head out of the car window on her way to work despite her popularity with the public walker didnt win enough votes at the utah republican convention in  for her reelection bid passed over in favor of jon huntsman jr and nolan karras some believed her tough stances on education and moderate politics as governor hurt her reelection bid as her political career ended she told the deseret news “i’ll just be a grandmother go down to st george and play some golf” the former governor did more than that she served a mission with her husband in new york city for the church of jesus christ of latterday saints for two years at  years old she was serving as primary president in the bloomington th ward the utah debate commission board which walker cochaired after it was formed in  also released a statement about her passing she will be remembered as a passionate advocate for educating citizens about their government but also as a friend to all read the statement from the executive committee in her later years walker turned her attention to encouraging students and women to get engaged in politics creating the institute at weber state university that bears her name the olene s walker institute of politics  public service mcnamara the director called walker among the most impressive human beings with whom i have been associated she added that walkers involvement is what inspired her to join as director shes larger than life in so many ways said mcnamara i think shes often the smartest person in the room in a statement jackie biskupski — set to become salt lake citys second female mayor — called walker a trailblazing woman in utah politics who made our state a better place by setting an example of civility and kindness that should be the hallmarks of public service in her final years friends said walker seemed to have more energy than others — serving on a dozen boards and continuing to advocate for causes such as education affordable housing and public lands leavitt said that was just like walker always looking forward not back “she was a person of great stature” said leavitt “whose feet did not leave the ground” posted

full text of speaker ryans remarks at the library of congress washington dc – speaking in the great hall at the library of congress today house speaker paul ryan rwi outlined his vision for a confident america at home and abroad pledging that his top priority as speaker in  will be offering the country a bold progrowth agenda remarks of speaker ryan as prepared for delivery december   “thank you very much i’m delighted to be here and to see so many friends in the audience thank you all for coming i also want to thank the library’s staff for their kind hospitality “the reason i asked you all here today is i wanted to lay out my numberone goal for the next year in the house i became speaker just over a month ago and i’d like to think we’ve hit the ground running we are dealing with everything from highways to isis to funding the government but before we get too far along i want to take a moment and explain the big thing i think house republicans need to do in  “a great frustration in our party is we have not had a real national majority in seven years we have controlled congress but not the presidency and we need to this country has big problems but if we do not have a president who will work with us we will not solve those problems—that is while they are still solvable and whatever the left may say i know my colleagues in the house republican conference i know why they got into politics we are not here to be someone but to do something—to serve our country we believe in the american idea the condition of your birth should not determine the outcome of your life and we want to do our part to pass on that idea to the next generation we do not see politics as a popularity contest to us it is a calling we do not care for the tricks of the trade what we love are ideas “so it is with great dismay that we have watched our president transform the country—and not for the better and it is natural after losing to your opponents for so long that people start to think maybe they are on to something maybe the way to win the debate is to play identity politics never mind ideas maybe what you do is slice and dice the electorate demonize polarize turn out your voters hope the rest stay home and i would just say yes it’s possible we could win that way—but to what end “i don’t think all that many people are walking away from this presidency thinking ‘that went well’ we still have enormous problems but now the country is divided and the federal government has grown arrogant condescending and outright paternalistic so i’d say what we’ve seen these past seven years is the illusion of success the left may be good at tactics but tactics are not solutions they can win an election but they can’t win a mandate they can make you popular but they can’t solve problems they can help a party but they can’t save the country so why in the world would we want to act that way “if we want to save the country then we need a mandate from the people and if we want a mandate then we need to offer ideas and if we want to offer ideas then we need to actually have ideas and that’s where house republicans come in so our numberone goal for the next year is to put together a complete alternative to the left’s agenda this is a work in progress no doubt so today i want to talk basics fundamentals what kind of country do we want to be i do not presume to speak for all republicans in all particulars but after giving it a lot of thought this is what i think a conservative vision looks like “we want america to be confident again if you don’t have a job we want you to be confident that you can find one—and take it if you do have a job we want you to be confident that that job will pay well we want students to know that all that school—and all that debt—will be worth it we want seniors to know that all those years of hard work—and all those years of paying taxes—will be rewarded medicare and social security will be there when you need them we want all americans when they look at washington to see spending going down taxes going down debt going down we want to see progress and have pride we want people to believe in the future again we want a country where no one is stuck where no one settles where everyone can rise “and on the world stage it is no different we want a confident america—a purposeful america we want to know we stand for freedom and show it—not with bluster or bravado but with calm steady action we want our military to command respect from our adversaries and to inspire confidence in our allies and when they come home we want to give our veterans the care they deserve we want our president whatever the party to always keep an eye on our interests and never turn a blind eye to the truth we want america to lead again that is the america we need “and that is not the america we have now the people are not confident they are downright anxious and they have every right to be but there is reason for hope—especially for conservatives the world is proving us right technology is making life more decentralized the old topdown formulas just won’t do for a long time the left has thought that if you want to solve a problem you get a group of highly trained experts to come up with an answer and impose it on the country nowadays most of us would agree that’s the last thing you should do the world moves just too fast government is always a step behind so oddly enough it is the progressives who are stuck in the past “and this is the thing they miss more bureaucracy means less opportunity—because big government and big business don’t fight each other so much as feed each other this is how it works smart talented people go into government thinking the only way to fix complicated problems is with complicated laws—laws that only people like themselves can understand they make new bureaucracies they put up red tape and then and then they go into the private sector and help businesses navigate the very maze they created if the insurance industry does not understand how obamacare works why not hire the person who ran it this works out great for them but what about the rest of us what about the people who can’t get ahead because costs are too high    or who don’t create jobs because the laws are so confusing and so round and round the revolving door goes all while the people stand on the sidelines “that’s how today’s experts become tomorrow’s cronies and that’s why we don’t think government should bulk up the bureaucracy we think it should break up problems so people can solve them themselves don’t hire more bureaucrats don’t leave it up to their discretion set clear firm rules that all of us can live by—rules that tell us what’s expected and what’s off limits and then let the people go to work that to me is the conservative insight don’t outsource to the bureaucracy crowdsource “that kind of government would not only preserve equal opportunity it would protect the dignity of the individual bad government tries to blunt what makes each of us unique good government defends it bad government tries to tie us all down good government frees us to be our best and so is government important absolutely—it’s essential but there’s no mistaking the field for the game what government is supposed to do is create an environment where the individual can thrive and communities can bloom in other words government makes things possible but the people make them happen “only government that sends power back to the people can make america confident again and we house republicans will do all we can to give us that government—even if the president disagrees even if he won’t sign them into law we will put out specific proposals and give the people a real choice and i don’t mean just undo what the president has done—as if we could timetravel back to  i mean show what we would do what our ideal policy would be—looking forward to  and beyond we owe it to the country to offer a bold progrowth agenda and that is what we are going to do “the first item on that agenda is creating jobs and raising wages and we know what’s standing in our way instead of a tax code that all of us can live by we have a tax code that none of us can understand we all know how hard it is to keep up with the competition overseas and where i come from overseas means lake superior well the canadians are taxing their small businesses at  percent but our top tax rate on successful small businesses is effectively  percent how can working families compete like that “the only way to fix our broken tax code is to simplify simplify simplify close all those loopholes and use that money to cut tax rates for everybody take the seven tax rates we have now and collapse them to two or three look i know people like many of these loopholes and they have their reasons but there are so many of them that now the tax code is like a todo list—washington’s todo list but washington has no business micromanaging people’s lives—pure and simple i also know many of these loopholes will be fiercely defended all i can say is we will not be cowed we are not here to smooth things over we are here to shake things up “i know ways and means chairman kevin brady can’t wait to get to work and this is the point we want a tax code that rewards good work instead of good connections when people know they will keep more of their hardearned money they will work more save more invest more—and create more jobs for all of us and when there is more work to go around more people will see their wages go up “but there’s not much upside to getting a raise if the cost of living goes up too there are many things to do but most urgent is to repeal and replace obamacare when people ask me what’s wrong with the law i usually say to them how much time do you have but if i had to point out one thing it would be the mandates the restrictions all the red tape how do i know they have failed you notice we don’t talk about lowering premiums anymore we’re supposed to be happy if they don’t go up by double digits “this is the problem the other side thinks that to lower costs for some people you have to raise them for others life is a zerosum game they know people won’t buy pricey insurance so their solution is don’t give them a choice we say lower costs for everybody by giving them that choice instead of forcing you to buy insurance we should force insurance companies to compete for your business let people find a plan that works for them and yes help people pay for health insurance “i’ve long believed we should offer an individual tax credit to help people pay for premiums—giving more to the old and sick there are a lot of other ideas out there but what all conservatives can agree on is this we think government should encourage personal responsibility not replace it we think prices are going up because people have too few choices not because they have too many and we think this problem is so urgent that next year we are going to unveil a plan to replace every word of obamacare “then there are the millions of people stuck in neutral  million people who have no choice but to work part time  million people living in poverty conservatives need to have an answer to this—because we do not write people off in this country we just don’t “but this is what happens the federal government says “look if you’re going through a rough patch we will pay for your food your housing your medicine your heat and on and on and on” add them all up and we have something like  different programs to help people in need and we’re thinking all these benefits will lift people up but in fact they hold people back—because under the law the minute you start to make real money these benefits start to disappear—and fast yes you’re making more money but you’re losing   cents on the dollar in higher taxes and lower benefits so say you’re a single mom with one kid you’re making minimum wage you’re on food stamps medicaid housing assistance and other assistance and you hear about a job that pays more should you really take that job the answer in this country should always be yes but can you really blame someone for thinking no the intentions may be good but the results are clear we are trapping people in poverty “we have to make sure it always pays to work in  we created a work requirement for welfare but that was just one program we have to fix all the others now i’d combine a lot of them and send that money back to the states for better povertyfighting solutions require everyone who can to work let states and communities try different ideas and then test the results i have found the poorest neighborhoods often are the most creative they are full of entrepreneurs and innovators—people who really know how to fight poverty they don’t need to be supplanted they need to be supported and so this is the difference between the left and the right they look at people in need and see a burden to bear people to take care of we look at people in need and see potential “push wages up push the cost of living down get people off the sidelines i could think of no better way to restore confidence in the american economy and as we grow more secure at home we will grow stronger on the world stage “in fact they are directly related if we want to create good jobs we need to make more things in america and sell them overseas because  percent of the world’s people—they don’t live in the united states they live in other countries and we will not sell them as much as we could if we don’t have trade agreements other countries will not stop taxing and blocking our exports unless we negotiate with them look at it this way if you add up all the countries that do not have a trade agreement with us we have a big manufacturing trade deficit but if you add up all the countries that do have a trade agreement with us we have a surplus now before we sign up for any agreement we have to make sure it is a fair deal i’m thinking of the transpacific partnership in particular but we have to engage only an active forwardleaning america can tear down barriers to american exports “and this is more than a negotiating strategy it goes to the core of our philosophy we believe in free enterprise we believe if you have a good idea you should have a fair chance to make it happen that means americans should not have to pay unnecessary costs or wait and wait and wait just to get a permit they should compete on a level playing field with everybody else i don’t know why we would not fight for every job out there i don’t know why we would accept—or even worse adopt—other countries’ corporate welfare when we know our way is better there won’t be a level playing field—there won’t be free and fair trade—unless we work for it china is out there every day pushing for crony capitalism so it all comes down to this question are we going to write the rules of the global economy—or is china “i would also say that uniting our friends behind good trade agreements will enhance our national security but of course the biggest danger to our national security is more straightforward our adversaries don’t respect us too many people think a warning from the united states is the hollow protest of a hasbeen “that has to change we need to build a st century military and i don’t mean just pour more money into the pentagon we have to reform the pentagon so it can adapt to new threats acquire new capabilities more quickly—whether it’s advanced missile defense or directed energy weapons and there’s no one better to lead that effort than the chairman of the house armed services committee mac thornberry “a strong america does not threaten the peace a strong america is what protects the peace now we need to act like it isis is a serious threat we need a strategy to defeat it our friends in europe and asia and the middle east are embattled we need to give them support we need to strengthen both our economy and our military to show the world that freedom works and when we do the world will see a confident america once again “this is how i see the choice now the country needs to see it today i have laid out our principles now we need to turn them into policies and we are not going to solve all the country’s problems next year we need a new president it’s just that simple but even if we can’t move mountains we can make moves in the right direction the cautious may wait for their opportunity but the prudent will make it we can make progress on issues where there’s bipartisan agreement like rebuilding our roads and bridges or bringing some certainty to the tax code we don’t have to compromise our principles to work with the other side even a blind squirrel can find a nut every now and then and hard as it might be to believe even politicians can find common ground “so what it all comes down to is whether we conservatives have confidence in ourselves do we really believe our philosophy is true do we have the best ideas if so then i don’t see any reason why we should hold back the truth is the left wants to make the debate about personalities they want to paint us as irresponsible that’s because we all know what the left stands for we all know what another progressive presidency would mean just more of the same “so don’t take the bait don’t play their game don’t give them a win by default put together a positive agenda and take it to the american people give people the choice they are yearning for and if next year this house can say we have done that then we will have done our job when the people go to the polls they will know that a vote for us is a vote for a more prosperous a more secure a more confident america and the rest well the rest will be up to the people—as it should be thank you” posted by bruce hough at  pm no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to

at this time of year  though our religious beliefs may differ our friendship may endure under the god who made us all  my best wishes to you and your families during this season of spring and new life i love this video clip httpeastermormonorgcidhptu  about the significance of the life atonement and resurrection of our savior jesus christ  i hope you enjoy it  ive also repeated my personal testimony of the jesus the christ below in this season of rebirth and renewal as buds reappear on the trees after a long winter and the blades of grass green and the plants push through the once frozen soil we are reminded of he who was dead and yet now lives even jesus christ but this wondrous event of the resurrection was necessarily preceded by the sacrifice of our redeemer and as the hymn reflects my own thoughts i stand all amazed at the love jesus offers me confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me i tremble to know that for me he was crucified that for me a sinner he suffered he bled and died   i marvel that he would descend from his throne divine to rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine that he should extend his great love unto such as i sufficient to own to redeem and to justify   i think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt such mercy such love and devotion can i forget no no i iwll praise and adore at the mercy seat until at the glorified throne i kneel at his feet   oh it is wonderful that he should care for me enough to die for me oh it is wonderful wonderful to me charles h gabriel  know that the promise of the atonement begun in gethsemane and culminating on golgotha is for us all if we will but repent of our transgressions and accept christs redeeming power  christ has felt every pain every anguish whether physical emotional or spiritual it is christs suffering that satisfies the law of justice that all sins must be punished and through his mercy grace and love he tempers that law for each of us how unloving would we be if we allow him to have suffered on our behalf having already paid the price and we do nothing all he asks is that we love him and love our neighbor and we do that by obeying his word and abandoning sin by doing so we show our love for all he has done for us and we make effective in our lives his atonement this is the road to eternal life and now on this easter day we celebrate the gift given to all mankind by the savior the resurrection the promise that all will live again with a body perfected and immortal knowing that christ lives is my testimony and more he has provided a way back to live with him and our father in heaven through his atoning sacrifice for which i stand all amazed this hymn summarizes well my testimony i know that my redeemer lives what comfort this sweet sentence gives he lives he lives who once was dead he lives my ever living head he lives to bless me with his love he lives to plead for me above he lives my hungry soul to feed he lives to bless in time of need he lives to grant me rich supply he lives to guide me with his eye he lives to comfort me when faint he lives to hear my souls complaint he lives to silence all my fears he lives to wipe away my tears he lives to calm my troubled heart he lives all blessings to impart he lives my kind wise heavenly friend he lives and loves me to the end he lives and while he lives ill sing he lives my prophet priest and king he lives and grants me daily breath he lives and i shall conquer death he lives my mansion to prepare he lives to bring me safely there  he lives all glory to his name he lives my savior still the same oh sweet the joy this sentence gives i know that my redeemer lives he lives all glory to his name he lives my savior still the same oh sweet the joy this sentence

you here my wife had high expectations for the movie noah  me less so  it isnt often that i am impressed with the tone and message of hollywoods interpretation of the spiritual  and for those attempting to create a true account of the biblical scriptures the art usually tends to be lacking ben hur not withstanding one of the business lessons to be learned from noah is dont assume that the other guy believes the same things you believe  in business you may be an ethical moral capitalist but the other guy may have no such compass to follow and may be dedicated to a winlose proposition  in the case of noah going to a biblical movie directed by an atheist and based not on the bible account of noah but on gnosticism and kabbalah see httpdrbrianmattsoncomjournalsympathyforthedevil  is a perfect example of setting incorrect expectations the problem is in business one is more inclined to conduct due diligence in these matters in movie going lets face it were there for an escape buttered popcorn and a diet coke the most redeeming moment of the movie was emma watsons character who is clearly smarter than russell crowes noah who lectured noah that his failure was exactly who god knew him to be one who would not take the innocent lives of babies  oh and i did quite like the depiction of the ark seemed pretty sound to me   other than that it wasnt that good of a movie  domestic box office was great the first week and then word of mouth probably brought it down  this is a movie that has been redeemed financially by its international release the allstar cast certainly gave it legs overseas take the time to read the link from dr brian mattson above  very interesting essay on the movie and its source material posted by bruce hough at  pm no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest tuesday december   hough family christmas greeting and card dear friends celebrating the holidays are always special for me because it signals a time when my family gathers together in a spirit of love and service  during this time many of my friends have celebrated hanukkah also known as the festival of lights in commemoration of the rededication of the holy temple  for me and my family we celebrate the birth of our savior jesus christ  but i love the idea of rededication    this is a wonderful time for all of us to rededicate ourselves to serving god serving our neighbors friends and family and especially serving those who are less fortunate than we are    it is also a time to rededicate ourselves to being engaged in good causes to better our community state nation and the world we live in  many people criticize the political process and there is often much to criticize  but i hope as the new year emerges we will be invigorated to make a difference by choosing to be involved and by supporting those who share our convictions and beliefs    the phrase and on earth peace goodwill toward men” has in the last two centuries been retranslated as  “on earth peace to men of good will”  this interpretation makes a good case for being men and women of good will  by acting out of good will towards others we will find peace in our lives as a blessing from god  peace may be one of gods most precious gifts  may we act out of good will towards others whether we agree or disagree with them    may god bless each of you in the coming year  all my best from my family to yours  bruce r hough national committeeman utah   posted by bruce hough at  pm no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest thursday october   nasdaq weighs in on apple fail and obamacare fail analogy im not the only who gets the apple fail and obamacare fail analogy  this mornings nasdaq briefing had this commentary attached note that apple spent  to develop the iphone and the federal government is up to over  to setup a website to connect to insurance companies do you understand why it is a bad idea to continue to rely on the federal government to do things best left to the private sector why government tech is so bad just before healthcaregov hobbled online kathleen sebelius secretary of health and human services compared the federal healthcare exchange to her ipads new operating system if users found a few bugs in their ipads she argued most wouldnt consider them a complete disaster instead theyd recognize that technology is complicated that errors are common and theyd wait for an update apple inc she added has a few more resources than her department so hopefully citizens will give us the same slack they give apple that argument is as clueless as it is misleading while its true that apple is fantastically wealthy its productdevelopment costs arent necessarily greater than those of the federal government as fred vogelstein reports in his coming book apple spent about  million developing the iphone the healthinsurance exchangewhich lets remember is merely a website meant to connect citizens to insurance companies something quite a bit less complex than apples groundbreaking miniature computerso far has cost at least  million and possibly as much as  million so how can the government spend so much more on technology and not get anywhere near equal results that gets to the larger problem with ms sebeliuss ipad argument when apple royally screws up the world doesnt cut it any slack and thats a good thing note what happened last fall when apple replaced google incs maps app with its own halfbaked version iphone users rebelled the tech press went ape and within a few days chief executive tim cook apologized and eventually fired the companys mobilesoftware chief in consumer tech performance matters when things go wrong customers balk investors flee and heads roll in the government despite several attempts at reform few of these consequences seem to apply isnt it time that changed healthcaregovwhich has been described as a failure by many experts including supporters of the health lawis only the latest in a series of faulty overpriced governmental tech launches during administrations of both parties it doesnt have to be this way theres nothing inherent about the phrase government technology that should inspire a parade of incompetence the tech needs of the feds dont have to be vastly more complicated expensive or legally daunting than the rest of the worlds instead the problem is a lack of accountability as ms sebeliuss comments underscore theres an expectation bolstered by the historical record that the government cant do tech well so were all expected to forgive its glaring shortcomings the truth is that the government could revamp its tech house for less money than we currently spend on it and with a smidgen of political will we could remake the nations it infrastructure using offtheshelf hardware and software and the best tech practices employed by the worlds most admired tech companies if we do so dealing with the governmentwhether for health care contracting taxes or for anything elsecould really be as painless as buying a book from amazon though everything in washington is partisan these days this thing doesnt have to be both democrats and republicans ought to be able to get on board with tech reform it would improve how we all interact with the government and make the whole system more efficient and affordable tech companies too should fight for a new way today a small number of insiders are awarded the bulk of federal it contracts reforming the way the government buys and uses tech would open up a vast market to companies such as apple google amazoncom inc a host of upstarts that are currently revolutionizing every other corner of economic life when you examine the follies at the heart of healthcaregov two important factors stand out experts say the first is personnellike many government it projects this was implemented by people who dont understand it theres a lack of technology leadership at the agency level leading to an inability to execute said vivek kundra who was appointed the nations first chief information officer by president barack obama in  and who is now an executive at the cloudservices company salesforcecom inc mr kundra said that when he was the nations cio the white house pushed a cloudfirst policy that encouraged government agencies to avoid creating new server farms every time they had to build new websites which is how the rest of the world works with tech it seems like with healthcaregov a set of decisions were made at the agency level that arent in line with how modern technology is deployed mr kundra said why would the government implement the sort of tech infrastructure that no one else would consider the answer is the mother all problems in government tech procurement thats jargon for the broken process by which the government buys things today any company looking to work with the government must navigate an obstacle course of niggling outdated regulations and arbitraryseeming requirements for instance your technology must be ykcompliant just to get in the door the process locks out all but a tiny handful of fulltime contractorscompanies who also happen to be big federal lobbyists note how cgi group inc which won the largest contract to build healthcaregov lobbied on behalf of the healthcare law clay johnson a former presidential innovation scholar and the ceo of a reformminded software company called department of better technology has written a sevenpart manifesto on how to fix procurement a prescription he says would go far in resolving most of the governments tech issues his upshot the government should strive to buy tech like the rest of the world does opening itself up to vastly more vendors and aligning price with performance logistically none of the steps he outlines would be very difficult to accomplish it would just require a fullcourt press from political leaders to make it happen these days that sounds like reason enough for pessimism though mr johnson argues that governments tech issues are on the verge of reaching a tipping point that will force action long term the government is not able to survive if it keeps using outdated technology because the gap between last years technology and this years technology is always exponentially growing he said you walk into the dmv and the person behind the desk has a crt monitor and you have an iphonethat leads to a gap to the perception of confidence we need to fix that if we want the government to maintain some semblance of confidence and competence httpdowjonescomtntassetsnasdaqamhtml posted by bruce hough at  am no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest tuesday october   apple map and obamacare two peas in a pod in the article below rnc chairman reince priebus quotes the washington post suggesting that if apple computer had the kind of failure on a new product roll out that obamacare has had that heads would roll    the reality is apple did launch a major new product that functioned badly… the apple map program which was a dismal failure at launch  apple did two things correctly that we should take a lesson from  first ceo tim cook immediately apologized for the flawed program and recommended other map programs for their customers to use and second they fired the executive and team that was in charge of this colossal failure  such a novel idea serving the best interests of their customers by recommending other programs until they had fixed theirs     the difference is apple will figure it out  they have a track record of innovation and performance  the federal government has a record of performance too unfortunately we just keep ignoring it the analogy between apple maps and the federal governments rollout of obamacare is astounding  the problem is big government thinkers simply don’t get it   its time to fire secretary sebelius politico rnc chairman reince priebus october   httpwwwpoliticocomstoryitstimetofiresecretarysebeliushtmlhpr “if apple launched a major new product that functioned as badly as obamacare’s online insurance marketplace the tech world would be calling for ceo tim cook’s head” that searing indictment of obamacare didn’t come from a conservative those were the words of the washington post’s ezra klein — yes liberal ezra klein —and evan soltas in a blog post on oct  just three days after the online obamacare marketplace opened they were right now two full weeks since its launch the website healthcaregov still isn’t functioning one cnn reporter began trying to sign up on oct  as of the morning of oct  she still hadn’t been able to a researcher who works for the new york times has tried and failed to sign up for obamacare  times since the website launched but the obama administration continues making excuses for health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius and the people who spent hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on a site that does not work how much more money will her department waste — and how much time will americans waste on the website — before the administration admits they have a problem in a business someone would be held accountable for such a largescale disaster when pressed on her failures sebelius repeats her favorite line “we had some early glitches” a glitch says merriamwebster is “temporary” and “minor” for two weeks the obamacare website has hardly functioned that’s not minor or temporary that’s not a glitch that’s a systemic failure hhs had over three years to build the system and the launch date still caught them entirely off guard—though not for a lack of warning signs the new york times — yes the liberal new york times — documented the many red flags obamacare’s “chief digital architect” worried the site would be a “thirdworld experience” the firm contracted to build the site didn’t start writing code until this past spring “as late as the last week of september officials were still changing features of the web site” reports the times back in february one insurance executive said he foresaw “a train wreck” he was right it’s bad enough that sebelius and company produced a terrible taxpayerfunded product it’s even worse that they didn’t heed the warnings or spot the red flags they put on a smile flipped the switch and sat by as it crashed now there is a very simple way that the obama administration could prove their critics wrong — a way to back up their claim that this really is all about a few “glitches” and that the site has worked for people they could release the number of americans who have enrolled for coverage but they won’t saying they don’t know the numbers yet and will only report them monthly think about that for a second this is not an administration that misses an opportunity to brag they’ve even leaked sensitive national security information to burnish their image they could release the numbers if they wanted the truth most likely is that the numbers would prove their many critics right then again maybe they did such a terrible job building the system that it’s impossible even to do something as simple as count enrollees the website is only part of the obamacare story the law continues to wreck the economy and endanger the healthcare of americans more and more families who already have insurance are now receiving the kind of letters that many americans dread they’re being dropped from their current plan writing for us news and world report peter roff shared an excerpt of the letter he received from his insurance company “among other things these affordable care act requirements will cause your benefits to change to include federallymandated essential health benefits since your current benefit plan does not conform to these new mandates your current health plan will cease upon your anniversary date” it said again and again and again president obama promised that if you like your plan you could keep it he lied and now what are these families without insurance supposed to do find a new plan on the exchanges what a train wreck even former obama press secretary robert gibbs says “this was bungled badly” adding “i hope they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work” i agree and the first person fired should be secretary sebelius reince priebus is chairman of the republican national committee posted by bruce hough at  pm no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest thursday october   hope for the republic the house is doing what it is supposed to do finally it is hard to comprehend that the senate majority leader harry reid and an msnbc reporter thomas roberts could be so clueless about how our constitutional republic is supposed to work first reid asks what give the house the right to pick and choose what they will fund  really  that is exactly what the house is supposed to do  they are finally doing it rather than passing huge omnibus bills while most members hold their nose at the inane projects pork barrel and unnecessary necessities included within  click the link to see harry make the point on why washington just doesnt get it httpwwwcnncomvideodatavideobestoftvexpbashreidcnnhtml i love that the congress is finally passing funding on a piecemeal basis  that means they know what they are passing out of the house  senator reid you asked what gives them the right  well to help you out see what the constitution says about who has the right this is what the constitution defines as the power of the purse “all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills”— us constitution article i section  clause “no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time”— us constitution article i section  clause  you know that balance of power thing  oh wait thomas roberts thinks that electing the president means there is a mandate for whatever he wants and congress should just rubber stamp his agenda because after all they are only  of the power in washington   guess what we dont care about the power in washington we care about our congressmen and senators doing what we elected them to do and for them to fulfill uphold and not abuse their constitutional responsibilities good grief roberts cant even make a decent argument reading the white house talking points gop chairman reince priebus utterly destroyed roberts logic on majority rules  i recommend that roberts watch this exchange apologize to priebus and take a personal oath to go back and study journalism before ever conducting another interview  hmmm maybe he is just doing what he was taught i wonder what liberal university taught him how to do his job  remember he wasnt specifically opining or editorializing which would have carried some kind of disclaimer he was purportedly reporting the news and doing a news interview httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvwenqlxjgqefeatureyoutube  all in all i hope the congress continues to piece meal funding legislation until as harry reid as properly concluded only obamacare is unfunded  posted by bruce hough at  pm no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest monday august   rnc takes a stand against media bias i just returned from a couple of days in boston for the republican national committee summer meetings  thematically we are looking ahead to  and  and are choosing not as governor christy colorfully declared looking at our navels  we do not need to litigate over and over why we lost in  though there are a lot of people who voted democrat who are asking themselves how they got snookered into that last year but we do need to learn from the past and not repeat the mistakes that were made mostly we have learned that you cannot run an  month campaign and expect to win  we have entered the era of the perpetual campaign  and with that realization the rnc is doing all of the right things to produce better results  one of those things is to not be the medias punching bag the time of  never argue with someone who buys ink by the barrel” are gone  because today ink is free  at least the written word now available universally through the internet is free and it is now a companion if not a replacement for the traditional mainstream media especially newspapers  do you think for minute that jeff bezos of amazoncom fame will follow anything even remotely traditional with his purchase of the washington post  he is the king of online and believe me he knows that paper and ink are not the delivery system of the future and guess what certain mainstream networks and even cable news networks are not the only choices anymore no one has a lock on communications media and as a party if a network is going to be blatantly biased there is no obligation or need to acquiesce to the assumption that they have a right to participate in the partys responsibility to conduct its primary debates  there are plenty of choices townhallcom got this right see the article below about rnc chairman reince priebus and his stand against media bias  i was proud to vote unanimously with my colleagues to inform those media outlets who are blatantly using their networks to promote other candidates that they can do so without including our candidates debates in their schedule of programming     august   priebus hits a home run bruce bialosky finally the republicans have someone in charge that is not afraid of his own shadow republicans are always cowering to the mainstream press while they mutter about the corrosiveness of it if he keeps it up the republicans might actually win the us senate in  and the presidency in  we are referring of course to reince priebus chair of the republican national committee rnc you probably have heard that two television operations announced they were doing projects about hillary clinton nbc has plans to produce and air a four hour miniseries about hillary clinton and cnn has plans for a documentary diane lane has been attached to the nbc miniseries to play ms clinton which speaks to the evenhandedness of that program that is equivalent to a film about my life story with brad pitt in the starring role in a previous world we would not even be having this discussion these projects would never ever have been brought forward because even my dogs know hillary clinton is running for president in  and the appearance of a potential conflict of interest would be killed by the news divisions but that does not happen any longer when cbs’s les moonves head of tv’s most successful network stated while attending a barack obama fundraiser that “ultimately journalism has changed… partisanship is very much a part of journalism now” why would anyone believe that nbc and cnn would be evenhanded they have defended their respective decisions by stating that the entertainment departments were planning these programs nbc can at least attempt this ploy since they have an entertainment division their ratings for the past decade notwithstanding cnn which last time anyone checked is solely a news network their argument is that cnn films a division of cnn worldwide is doing the film one wonders if cnn sports is next fortunately mr priebus saw through this charade and finally drew a line that should have been drawn years ago priebus must have been watching in  when carole simpson of abc news hosted a debate that was so slanted against president george hw bush you would have thought she was on the clinton payroll he certainly was watching as candy crowley of cnn injected herself in the debate between president obama and mitt romney with an absolutely wrong answer regarding what obama said september   about benghazi and terrorism thus ending romney’s attempt to unsettle obama on a critical issue priebus came out and stated the obvious that if these two operations went forth with their hillary projects the republicans would not play ball with them during the  election cycle that means the republican primary debates would be held on networks other than nbc msnbc or cnn one has to wonder why republicans would have debates on these networks in the first place  as if they would be fair and evenhanded envision lawrence o’donnell asking marco rubio why his policies encourage the starvation of young children when priebus appeared on fox news’ special report he misspoke when being interviewed by bret baier by stating the rnc would want to approve the moderators for debates baier jumped on that but priebus is not far off maybe the rnc should not approve moderators but they certainly should be able to veto moderators who they have every reason to believe would be less than fair in critical moments of debates priebus appears to be on firm ground chuck todd of nbc news came out and said that the proposed miniseries would be a nightmare for the news division andrea mitchell followed up criticizing the project it is nice to see that the network of huntley brinkley chancellor and brokaw still has a modicum of integrity unfortunately voices have been silent at cnn how nbc can go forward with their political reporters in open revolt will be fascinating to watch kudos to priebus for coming forth and saying we aren’t going to take it any longer this follows on the heels of some other commonsense decisions that sources say are coming down the pipeline these decisions include actual fullblown outreach to minorities moving the national convention to june and limiting the endless string of primary debates to a set number that will only protect all candidates from the supercilious situation that occurred in  next thing you know the rnc will be establishing integrated candidate development from the grassroots through the national level – actual cooperation for all levels of the republican party if the mainstream media revamps how they operate to recognize the new reality that was clearly enunciated by cbs president les moonves then republicans need to confront that new reality and adjust how they operate priebus took the first step and it was a crush davis grand slam priebus hits a homerun posted by bruce hough at  pm no comments links to this post email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to
