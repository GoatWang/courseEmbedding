like to turn it over to brad brad elliott thanks john good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter  equity bancshares earnings call im brad elliott chairman and ceo and here with me this morning is our cfo greg kossover it has been a very exciting week in the equity bank franchise the announcement of the mergers with patriot bank in tulsa and eastman national bank in ponca city in newkirk signals of entry into oklahoma with two new outstanding banking partners id like to say again how impressed we are with michael bezanson team in tulsa and the team in ponca city in newkirk led by mark detten and jim leach we follow that great news today and with our record second quarter  results this performance is the result of very hard work and unselfishness of our teams here at equity bank the teams at hoxie grinnell and quinter have now been with equity bank for a full quarter and has integrated nicely mike jeff sherry and steve and their teams are already making an impact as deposits and have also increased  million in deposits since closing and were just as excited about the future of the western kansas markets as we were when we introduced the hoxie team to our franchise also our operating teams in wichita once again made the process of integrating a new bank look easier than it is myself and our board of directors thank each of our hardworking teams for all you do every day which takes us back to our record quarter by closing and converting our mergers at the same time the focus can turn immediately to integration and performance in the second quarter that have lead to  in net income or  per share both records for equity bancshares for the quarter annualized return on assets was over  and return on tangible common equity was over  and our efficiency ratio was less than  these metrics are the hard earned results from everyone at equity bank for our shareholders and as i have said in recent announcements weve bolstered the teams with the addition of wendell bontragers president scott smits as chief credit officer and transitioned julie huber to lead mergers and integrations the impact of these individuals and their teams allows greg and i to  resources to continue to build our merger pipeline with opportunities in our footprint before we go through our second quarter numbers i want to thank our board of directors for their leadership in our journey to serve as chairman of the board with these talented and diverse individuals is a privilege each of them brings something unique to the table and collectively they come together with hard work passion experience and business acumen to deliver value and growth to our shareholders thank you directors for all you do greg greg kossover thank you brad we begin with our earnings and as brad said q delivered  per share and  in aftertax income to the shareholders this is  earnings per share growth compared to  per share the same quarter in  and  growth over the  per share in the march  quarter interest income was up  from first quarter and interest expense was up  both increases largely due to the hoxie branches being online for an entire quarter loan yield in the second quarter was  and scrubs for higherthanexpected purchase accounting accretion of about  was approximately  this compares to adjusted q yield on loans of about  securities yield was  in the second quarter normalized for  bond call gain compared to  in the first quarter this increasing yield is due primarily from a slowdown in cmbs prepayment speeds resulting in less premium amortization deposit cost increased from  basis points to  basis points a modest reflection of overall rate increases cost of other borrowings increased  basis points to  as a federal home loan bank cost increased following the fed rate hikes all of this leads to net interest margin of  and adjusted for the unusual purchase accounting and securities yield lift as mentioned above results a net interest margin of  compared to about  for q provision for loan losses was  in the quarter on muted net chargeoffs of  or about three basis points our credit quality remains high and our alll has grown  since the beginning of the year noninterest income was generally in line with expectations noninterest expense was higher than expected primarily from growth related expenditures of approximately  in merger expenses  in recruiting and  in core deposit intangible amortization greater than forecast and from higher than budgeted edp of  and travel and training of  income taxes were approximately in line with our expectations at about  as mentioned earlier stated earnings per share is  per share left in the securities payoff gain and purchase accounting accretion in excess of business plan represent about  per share and drag from merger expenses represent about  per share resulting in an adjusted eps of about  per share turning to the balance sheet brad will add some color to loans and deposits brad elliott our loan growth was lower than normal in the second quarter at just over  million primarily because we had one large credit payoff as we did not chase rate and credit structure below our standards in order to retain it our team has continued to an outstanding job of sourcing and servicing customers who understand relationship banking and the value it brings to their businesses i remain pleased with our pipeline for quality credits our community markets are doing well thanks to efforts from all our lenders in those markets and our metro lending team led by mark parman in kansas city and jeremy machain in wichita continued to develop and close fee relationships within our guidelines it is also exciting to think about onboarding mike bezanson and his team in tulsa later this year and mark detten and his team in ponca city they had two new markets with outstanding lenders to the equity team regarding deposits our teams did a nice job of cultivating new deposits one of our highly successful customers invested approximately  million in their business in the second quarter utilizing deposits held through first quarter year  first quarter end to do so otherwise our deposits increased by approximately  million in the quarter greg kossover on the rest of the balance sheet investment securities balances were relatively flat during the quarter and oreo was up only because of the known nonperforming loan identified premerger and marked appropriately move to oreo as anticipated our alll stands at  basis points of loans up three basis points quarteroverquarter and from year end nearly every special asset metric improved during the quarter classified assets to regulatory capital has already declined  after the most recent acquisitions to  past due loans declined  from  basis points to  basis points of loans and nonaccrual loans dropped  to  of total loans quarteroverquarter these improvements are the result of a lot of hard work from julie scott smits and their teams federal home loan bank advances end of the quarter at about the same level as march  our asset liability position has not changed measurably quarteroverquarter and we remain day one liability sensitive and year one asset sensitive capital ratios all remained strong and is worth mentioning that we issued over  common shares in the last three quarters in the two acquisitions and the pipe representing share growth of  this type of share growth is cost efficient adds float and the dispersion of shares is healthy for our stock and its holders brad elliott as i said at the top of the call we cross several key lines on our core metrics greater than  roa per quarter and efficiency ratio of less than  we are growing into our efficiencies and we believe our toopronged approach of growing organically and through mergers gives us an advantage in our markets our credit quality remains high our margin is healthy our organic loan and deposit pipelines are active as is our merger pipeline our board and leadership are more excited than ever for what is possible for our stakeholders i would like to thank all of our shareholders for their trust in equity bancshares and all its team members this is an exciting time for everyone and we could not be successful without each of you at this time id be happy to entertain questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from andrew liesch from sandler o’neill your line is open andrew liesch question on the margin and any benefits from the rate hike i think in prior quarters you said it will be about two basis points was that the case this quarter and then do you think the june hike will be similar benefit in the third quarter brad elliott yes andrew i think our margin improved for a couple of reasons the rate hike and then also we had a small lift from the yield on the portfolio brought over from hoxie but primarily the rate hike and yes we would anticipate a similar reaction in q andrew liesch and then  i am sorry i missed it the other line item in noninterest income just curious what drove that increase brad elliott increase in noninterest income is  boy andrew liesch just may be the four quarter in fact the hoxie do it couple hundred thousand dollars as well brad elliott the impact from hoxie and andrew off the top of my head i dont know what the other component is most of it would be the increase in hoxie give me a minute and let me dig into what that is operator and our next question comes from michael perito from kbw your line is open michael perito greg i apologize i know i think you probably went through it in the opening remarks but i got on the call little late i just want to confirm a couple margin numbers with you i think last quarter the loan fees were about  basis points do you have that number for the second quarter greg kossover yes it’s real similar loan fees were flat to a little better quarteroverquarter and are pretty strong so that number has not changed measurably michael perito okay and then the purchase accounting or accruable impact i think it was  basis points last quarter and once again i apologize if you gave it already but what was it in the second quarter greg kossover about the same michael perito about the same okay and then any comments on kind of where you expect the quarterly expense trajectory to run here i guess really just  in the next couple of quarters before patriot and eastman close greg kossover yes if you carve out transaction expenses related to those two acquisitions a core run rate is probably between  a quarter  i think is a good run rate and probably closer to  million michael perito okay and do you expect the  maybe a question on the balance sheet do you expect the investment portfolio to kind of i guess  with these two deals coming off at the end of the year and it build a little on the quarter my guess is because the loan growth  the net loan growth didnt materialize but how do you  what is your kind of six months outlook through the investment portfolio do you think it kind of hangs out in this real north of  million range or do you think theres room to move it down as the growth picks up in the back half of the year greg kossover i think that probably you’re going to see it relatively flat  million is probably a good number for us right now i dont think it will increase michael it may go down a little bit but i dont think it will be higher than what it is today michael perito thank you for that and then just last one for brad maybe just do you  and again i apologize if i missed it but the maybe the dollar on the pipeline how does it compare today versus three months ago or maybe at the beginning of the year and i guess it sounds like you guys despite things putting on credit expect loan growth to rebound a bit in the next quarters is that a fair statement greg kossover so weve got a really good pipeline july is looking like a solid month august assuming that all the fundings hold in that are scheduled for closing july will be a very large months for us probably double what july would be then we have a kind of normal month in september so we have a pretty good pipeline for this quarter and we also have a pretty good longer than  days pipeline a lot of those fundings we got a good growth number coming from just construction draws that are already on the books so i think our pipeline is holding in there pretty well i think the number show we’re going to back on plan for this month so i think weve got a good pipeline and anticipating knock on wood that nothing comes out of the wood work on our paydown or something i think weve got a pretty good opportunity to continue to grow loans our teams in wichita kansas cities and the guys in western kansas are really kicking in and have a lot of really good opportunities that weve approved so operator operator instructions and our next question comes from terry mcavoy from stephens your line is open nathaniel tower hey guys this is actually nat standing for terry maybe some commentary on deposit pricing and deposit betas in some of your community markets might be helpful brad elliott repeat that question terry nathaniel tower this is actually nat any commentary around how deposit are repricing right now how betas are looking and then your outlook for that would be helpful brad elliott you will take that greg greg kossover one more time brad elliott he wants know about the deposit  you’re breaking a little bit i think we’ve got it so the question nat is how deposits repricing is working and how the betas are working nathaniel tower exactly greg kossover yes so nat i think they broke on me  the betas are still very low deposit repricing is still very small we still  other than in our public deposit sector which does is influenced more easily by rate increases than the retail base we really havent seen significant upward pressure on our rates and therefore our betas are still low i don’t how long that will last and we were adding some new markets which might have a different characteristic as we go forward but so far we’re not seeing a huge spike and the need for rate increases to draw deposits public funds because of the nature of their ownership are more sensitive to rate increases and we do carry public funds as a core business for us and so that would be the exception to that comment nathaniel tower and then maybe one more from me and im sorry we keep beating a dead horse here but credit keeps looking great do you guys have any areas that you’re watching out for specifically any areas of concern or anything that you’re staying away from that brad elliott so at this time we dont see a lot of weakness i mean we are staying away from things that would have a lot of volatility but we aren’t getting a lot of those requests either in the oil and gas business but  direct oil and gas business but at this time outside of you know that sector we just dont see  we havent felt or seen a lot of weaknesses in our marketplace we’re watching the ag credits closely and we’re monitoring our borrowers they actually are having a pretty good year this year especially if they have a balance at all of any cattle they have a lot of rebound in the cattle markets so that sector is actually doing better than we had anticipated but weve got our eye on multifamily making sure that you know we’re in projects at work and we dont have a lot of concentration in that but we got our eye on that sector it just seems like its overheated for some reason but they still seem to be written up and leasing up operator and our next question comes from bruce binisie from private investor your line is open unidentified analyst youre talking about the efficiency ratio of  however when i look at page  it’s  it was the  just second quarter or what the… brad elliott  is just the second quarter unidentified analyst okay brad elliott so the  is yeartodate and as you can see really with the integration of prairie merger we’ve got  its coming down unidentified analyst one other question on page  under the capital ratios its listing riskweighted for both equity banks here and the bank at  they dont have the same amount of assets do they is there a difference there or what amount are looking at greg kossover on the capital ratios roughly the same bruce unidentified analyst yes okay all right well thats fine i was just making sure those are my question operator and at this time im showing no further questions id like to turn the call back to mr john hanley for any closing remarks greg kossover andrew this is greg again since youve asked your question i have done quick scan of our other miscellaneous incomes and a lot of it comes from having the western kansas be bigger from the prairie acquisition and a lot of those accounts are related to customer activity which is always a little more brisk in the second quarter than the first quarter so im not seeing anyone category thats driving that change in other income john hanley with that said ladies and gentlemen thank you once again
