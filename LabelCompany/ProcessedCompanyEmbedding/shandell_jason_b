mr jason shandell president of amphastar pharmaceuticals sir you may beginjason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director thank you good afternoon and welcome to amphastar pharmaceuticals first quarter earnings call my name is jason shandell president of amphastar im joined today with my colleague bill peters cfo of amphastar we appreciate you joining us on the call today and look forward to speaking with you and answering any questions you may haveread moreill now turn the call over to our cfo bill peters to discuss the first quarter financialswilliam j peters amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  cfo senior vp treasurer and president of international medication systems ltd thank you jason sales for the first quarter decreased  to  million from  million in the previous years period sales of enoxaparin declined to  million from  million due to both lower volumes and lower average selling prices naloxone which for the first time is our biggestselling product this quarter saw sales increase to  million from  million on higher unit volume at lower average selling prices due to increased discounts and rebatessales of our epinephrine vial totaled  million in the quarter and were the main reason why our total epinephrine sales increased to  million however we will have to discontinue selling epinephrine vials by may  unless the fda grants our request for an extension to sell our current inventoryour insulin api business generated sales of  backorders are not usually a material factor for the company however we ended the first quarter with an  million backorder this resulted from our ims plant shutdown in december and early january we shut down the finished products manufacturing area to install new equipment to increase capacity and improve our quality systems however the project took longer than expected compounding this situation a competitor experienced a shortage of  products in the quarter leading to a surge in order for these products we expect to relieve the backorder situation by the end of our second quarter which should lead to an increase in sales for products from our ims facility in this quartercost of revenues declined in dollar terms to  million from  million gross margins declined slightly to  of revenues from  of revenues in the previous years period primarily due to lower margins for enoxaparin and because our reduced manufacturing at ims facility led to a decrease in overhead absorptionselling distribution and marketing expenses increased slightly to  million from  million in the previous years period general and administrative spending increased to  million from  million primarily because of increased legal expenses research and development expenditures increased to  million from  million as we increased expenditures on apis and other supplies ahead of several clinical trials planned for later this yearadditionally we recognized a gain of  million on the sale of andas we had previously purchased the company reported a profitable quarter with net income of approximately  or  per share compared to last years first quarter net income of  million or  per share the company reported an adjusted net income of  million or  per share compared to adjusted net income of  million or  per share in the first quarter of last year adjusted earnings excludes amortization noncash equity compensation and impairmentson march   the company had approximately  million of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm restricted investments in the first quarter cash flow from operations was approximately  million and was positive for the th quarter in a row we used a significant amount of our cash to increase our share buyback program as our stock price declined over the quarter with cash spent on buybacks totaling over  million from the quarterwe reviewed our financial assumptions for the year on the last call and they have not changed so i will now turn the call back over to jasonjason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director thanks bill we continue to make good progress on our pipeline since our last earnings call we filed one additional anda that brings the total number of andas on file with the agency to  which represents a market size of over  billionin march  the fda performed a preapproval inspection at amphastar for  of the  andas on file with the agency four of these products have gdufa dates in  and one was filed pregdufa with respect to the pregdufa anda there are no outstanding questions from the fda and we hope to be able to launch the product in the second half of the year which would provide meaningful revenues for the company in with respect to our crl for primatene mist we had a meeting with the fda in the first quarter in which the agency provided a more detailed explanation of its request for an additional human factor study we are currently assessing this informationwith respect to our crl for intranasal naloxone we have a meeting scheduled with the fda in the second quarter to discuss the issues that need to be resolved in order to receive approval we believe that the realworld data for this product demonstrates its safety and efficacy and fda approval is in the interest of the public health given the ongoing opioid epidemic that is plaguing our countryas bill discussed we had an  million backorder at the end of the first quarter this backorder was the result of the ims facility shutdown increased demand due to supply interruptions of our competitor and several stability fills for one of our highpriority pipeline products ims is currently manufacturing commercial products as fast as it can and we expect to make up for the  million in sales in the second quarterwith that update i will now turn the call over to the operator to begin qaquestions and answersoperator operator instructions and our first question comes from david amsellem with piper jaffraydavid a amsellem piper jaffray companies research division  md and senior research analyst just a couple so first on primatene can you just elaborate on your thought process on potential next steps or whether youre leaning towards abandoning the asset altogether and then secondly regarding the products with gdufas can you just say which are  how many of them are injectables versus inhalation products and the nongdufa product if thats an injectable or an inhalation product or something elsejason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director sure so your first question about primatene no were not looking to abandon the product we still believe its approvable i think we had a good conversation with the fda we got into some details regarding the human factor study they requested and some of the specifics around the protocol at this time were discussing this with our thirdparty consultants to determine the next steps with this application with respect to the gdufa at this time all  products that are on file all the  andas on file with the agency theyre all injectable so that includes the nongdufa as well and the nongdufa is the one weve talked about in previous calls where its been on file for quite some time so weve got more transparency with respect to that product so we feel good theres no outstanding questions so were still hopeful for approval of that product although there is no gdufa dateoperator our next question comes from david maris with wells fargo securitieskathryn tracy brennan wells fargo securities llc research division  associate analyst this is katie brennan on for david can you let us know when will you know if the fda grants that extension to sell the epinephrine vials do they typically give more than  days notice of a decision like that and do you intend to eventually get this product approved for manufacturing and distribution in the futurejason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director yes so first of all we had requested for more time and that was denied but were kind of appealing that request and  to some higherlevel people there so were in that process right now so thats why were down to just a couple days left and as far as  we do want to get that product approved eventually weve been selling it for a very long time and we are working on that process as weve mentioned we have  unapproved products that we sell this is one of the  and of the  we filed for those products and then   the other  were working on filingskathryn tracy brennan wells fargo securities llc research division  associate analyst okay great also can you speak to the time lines for ultimately  your internal time lines for hopefully getting your  ndas that were recently  you received crls on refiled so i know you gave an update on kind of where they stand but do you have a goal for when you will refile those ndasjason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director so with respect to naloxone we do have a meeting with the fda this quarter so that will give us  probably by the next call well have a better idea with respect to that application and then on primatene we did have our meeting it was helpful so right now we are talking with our thirdparty consultants in terms of what we should do so i cant say we have an exact time line on refiling once we have further discussions with the consultants well figure out our next stepoperator our next question comes from elliot wilbur with raymond jameselliot henry wilbur raymond james  associates inc research division  senior research analyst gentlemen could you just provide us with an update on enoxaparin market dynamics and then specifically just thinking about your presence in the retail market basically where you think you are in terms of current share dynamics then how you thinking about that opportunity going forward whether or not potential distribution partnership is still on the table or basically youve thoroughly vetted the explored debt just not really getting what you want and youre prepared to go it alone maybe a little bit just more color on current dynamics therejason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director sure so right now as you know at the end of december we began shipping into the retail channel as we took over for actavis in that area we did lose some share on the retail side and unfortunately because actavis had lost some before they  their agreement with us had ended and we were not able to get that back the dynamics right now is that the pricing is very low which is why we took that inventory writedown at the end of the year last year so its difficult to gain any kind of market share from where we are right now so  and thats why that combination of price decline and market share decline led to the decline in the sales that we had this quarter i will say that at the beginning of the quarter the sales were even a little slower than we had thought i think because there were still some actavis inventory kind of making its way through the inventory channel so that could tick up a little bit but were definitely significantly below our run rate from a year agoelliot henry wilbur raymond james  associates inc research division  senior research analyst okay so i guess thats what im ultimately trying to get at so if we look at the weekly rx share out there i mean there hasnt been that much of degradation for the ims product but im assuming some of that still represents legacy actavis inventory is that fairjason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director yes so right now theres still some legacy actavis share out there but the reality is the customer that they did lose they lost i think in november so i dont think that that customer really has  there shouldnt be any more of the inventory out there flowing from that customer so i think that as far as this quarters sales they might be a little light because january i think there were still some inventory flowing through the channel but we are down significantly from a year agoelliot henry wilbur raymond james  associates inc research division  senior research analyst okay and then just a followup question on some of your earlier pipeline commentary jason i apologize i may have missed this in your prepared commentary but the andas the  with gdufa dates that were part of the preapproval inspection all of those are calendar  gdufa dates i would assumejason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director yes thats right we actually  the one that we just filed recently we got a  on that but the  that we filed over the last  quarters have  gdufa dateselliot henry wilbur raymond james  associates inc research division  senior research analyst okay and those were all  but those were all included as far as the pai  the most recent paijason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director yes exactly so the most recent pai was for  products and so the  that have gdufa dates this year as well as the one pregdufa the one that we just filed recently that makes number  that has not received a preapproval inspection yetelliot henry wilbur raymond james  associates inc research division  senior research analyst right okay and then just one final question you previously talked about potentially submitting a respiratory asset for  or by the end of this  potentially by the end of this year or possibly early  just wanted to see if you had a little bit more clarity in terms of the time line there but i cant recall previously if youve disclosed whether or not thats a j or a b but any additional color there would be helpfuljason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director sure so yes were still aiming for the end of the year to file  more andas so we wanted to do  to  this year we just did one recently an injectable anda weve got  more andas so j one is in inhalation and one is an injectable and were hoping for the end of  but it could slip to early operator and our next question comes from gary nachman with bmo capital marketsnicole germino this is nicole on for gary just a quick question on the gross margins so gross margins were around  in q is that a good level for the rest of the yearwilliam j peters amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  cfo senior vp treasurer and president of international medication systems ltd yes its a pretty good level until we get any new approvalsnicole germino okay and just one more quick question going back to enoxaparin could you talk about the difference in the economics to you for the portion of the volume that flows through retail im just trying to get a sense of what the runway should look like going forward for enoxaparin over the next few quarterswilliam j peters amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  cfo senior vp treasurer and president of international medication systems ltd yes so the way it used to work for actavis is that we sold them product at a transfer price and then split the profit although for over the last year the profit was pretty close to  the transfer price  our cost of goods that come down slightly by the end of that contract so we were making a small margin on that so  but right now this is a product where on average were not making any money on so our margins are  or below  and as  we potentially have to reserve inventory for a lower cost to market situation thereoperator our next question comes from david steinberg with jefferiesdavid michael steinberg jefferies llc research division  equity analyst just an additional question on primatene on your last quarterly call you had indicated you could probably do another study relatively easily in a short period of time but that was before your fda meeting i was curious do you still think post that meeting that you could have a relatively short time line and secondly you got a crl and they asked for another human factor study but they had already asked for human factor studies did you ask them during the meeting why all of a sudden theyre asking you to do additional studies in the same realm and how can you be sure if they ask  once you finish this human factor study theyre not going to ask you for another one next timejason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director sure thats a good question i mean  and this is what were assessing right now so with respect to the first question to do another study that does remain the same it would be a very short time line the real issue is getting on the same page with them with respect to the protocol so we did have a discussion regarding what they were looking for and of course we asked look we feel that the human factor studies that we did had good results and thats what it came down to was actually the protocol in terms of the participants their interaction with the moderator and exactly how to refer back to the label so we got into a lot of specific protocol questions and also it has been collaborative in that they do try to emphasize that it could be another study they had some suggestions on some of the label some of the wording and some of the suggestions we agree with so they feel if we modify the label another time to further improve it theyd like to see one more study with the endpoints that we had agreed todavid michael steinberg jefferies llc research division  equity analyst okay and then on ma obviously generic pricing is cyclical and were clearly in a bad bad period of time during that cycle yet at the same time there are still acquisitions going on just curious are you looking  are you pretty active on the ma front if so are you seeing a lot of products available and secondly if youre looking at private companies have valuation expectations come down in line with the publiclytraded comparableswilliam j peters amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  cfo senior vp treasurer and president of international medication systems ltd yes ill say weve looked at a couple things this year so far and i would say the valuations have not come down from what  for the assets that weve been looking atoperator and our next question comes from david maris with wells fargo securitiesdavid william maris wells fargo securities llc research division  senior analyst i am not sure if my colleague asked this already but a number of the setbacks have there been any changes in personnel or addition of consultants or  that may make the probabilities higher of approvals going forwardjason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director yes thanks for the question so actually in terms of consultants we have added some consultants on regulatory that could be very helpful and have added some value already so i would say that we have engaged some very good consultants to help us with some of these productsoperator at this time im showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to mr jason shandell for closing remarksjason b shandell amphastar pharmaceuticals inc  president general counsel and director thank you very much operator this concludes our call for today
