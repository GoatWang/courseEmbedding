francisco california  httpwwwgapinccom ■ having proved himself a competent and successful leader in several positions at the disney corporation paul s pressler made a controversial move to take over operations at gap because of his lack of fashion experience some doubted his ability to change the direction of the retailer that had experienced  straight months of sales losses however pressler used his open management style and innovative ideas based on market research and the expertise of his employees not only to turn the company around but to add new chances for growth into gaps future plans from toys to theme parks born in  paul pressler grew up on long island he graduated from the state university of new york at oneonta in  with a bachelors degree in economics his first foray paul s pressler  reuters newmedia inccorbis  into the business world was as an urban planner for new york city he stayed there for a short time before he moved over into the toy business he worked for both remco toys and mego toys before he was hired by kennerparker toys as the vice president of marketing and design in  at kennerparker he made his mark by guiding the company successfully in its marketing of the popular care bears line presslers achievements with the care bears marketing campaign were noticed by disney which offered him a position as the senior vice president for product licensing in  pressler accepted the job starting his year relationship with the company he held a multitude of positions with disney over the years including senior vice president for all consumer products and executive vice president and general manager of disney stores while pressler held the latter position the number of disney stores increased and sales steadily improved largely because of presslers idea of making each store a minidisneyland giving each customer a fantastical shopping experience in  pressler was chosen to head the disneyland parks and hotels in anaheim california and in  he was promoted to president of disney theme parks and resorts worldwide presslers success in raising profits and making the disney brand popular to people of all ages made many analysts think he might one day take over michael eisners position at the top a fashion sense in  however pressler made a move that was considered by some to be foolish he took over the presidency of gap in fact pressler was criticized when he took over operations at gap because he lacked fashion experience gap inc owned the gap banana republic and old navy chains the companys previous chief executive millard drexler was known for his topdown style of management he thought up the ideas and the company followed his word pressler came into the company with a different approach caring much less about his personal tastes and instincts and much more about data from market research he stated openly that he would not be doing any of the design work he hired experts to take care of that end of the business for him he also became known for his willingness to experiment even holding a fashion show in which actors and actresses dressed in gaps newest lines and posed on stage at a nightclub he kept out of the limelight sharing the credit for the stores turnaround with his entire staff especially the designers whose work he began to showcase when pressler took over gap the company was in enormous debt having spent almost two and a half years in sales declines one of the first things pressler did as president and ceo was to reestablish the firms brands the three stores the gap banana republic and old navy had begun to blur together losing their distinct personalities pressler resolved to sharpen eash stores focus in banana republic it meant some reinvention… in the case of gap it was clearly going back to our heart and soul and in the case of old navy it was about driving deeper to take share from our value sector pressler was quoted in womens wear daily april   pressler hoped that his branding efforts would lower the gaps enormous debt he began a companywide makeover that would take a year before showing results in february  pressler was named one of the people to watch by fortune magazine by that time he had managed to reverse gaps sales decline things were looking up for company and presslers onetime critics were beginning to change their opinions about his ability to succeed at gap don fisher the chairman of the board of gap was quoted by womens wear daily as saying weve changed a lot in the past year weve hired a new ceo strengthened our board and dramatically improved our performance paul pressler has done a terrific job in his first year as ceo and im more confident than ever about our companys longterm prospects december   the first test of presslers success occurred in  when the first line of clothes that his team had come up with hit the stores the fall line centered on colorful corduroys and had a marketing campaign centered on celebrities like madonna and missy elliott pressler got a big break when a picture of madonna decked out in gap clothing was chosen to be the cover of the september issue of harpers bazaar  the line was an instant success and presslers fitness for the positions of president and ceo of gap were no longer derided widening the gap in  pressler and his team researched opportunities for acquiring stores they were also interested in more international expansion and continued to extend existing brands in june  pressler managed to secure popular actress sarah jessica parker to lead gaps th anniversary campaign at the

is now viewed as the wrong guy at the wrong time february    am est when paul s pressler arrived as the chief executive officer of gap inc gps  in the fall of  he was exactly what the board wantedor at least what it thought it wanted the polished goodlooking disney veteran was a hardnosed operations wizard not a dreamy fashion junkie he seemed to be just the man to restore discipline to the floundering company but over the next four years gaps performance came apart at the seams on jan  pressler resigned the immediate postmortem analysis he was a numbers guy who didnt appreciate the nuances of the fashion business thats true but its only part of the story presslers problems involved more than just a few bad bets on colors and styles according to  former employees interviewed by businessweek he also bungled some of the very things that were supposed to be his strengths including costcutting campaigns human resources initiatives and supply chain streamlining efforts one exemployee characterizes presslers tenure as total system failure presslers management shortcomings were particularly visible at the companys most important division its flagship gap brand the story of his failed effort to fix this onceproud chain insiders say is a classic demonstration of what can happen when a talented man is handed the wrong mission he is a skilled leader and he understands how to build a team but unfortunately he didnt build a team for the particular challenges gap faced says a former insider maybe he was the wrong guy at the wrong time gap wouldnt comment for this article weve said what we have to say on pauls departure and are moving on with the business said company spokesman greg rossiter at the time pressler left board chairman robert j fisher said that the company improved its operations strengthened its balance sheet greatly enhanced its online presenceand improved its standing as a global corporate citizen under the exceos leadership pressler didnt respond to repeated requests for comment including a list of written questions in the wake of presslers departure gap is still reeling companywide sales at stores open at least a year fell  in the most recent fiscal fourth quarter which ended feb  fullcompany earnings for  are expected to decline  to  million although shares ran up significantly following presslers arrival increasing from about  a share in the fall of  to more than  during the summer of  they have traded in the to range ever since now frustrated investors are waiting for a big strategy pronouncement the gap has promised to deliver on mar  some hope the board of directors will put the entire company up for sale thats a steep fall for a retailer that just a decade ago seemed perfectly attuned to american tastes when the workplace went casual in the s gap was at the ready with big selections of khaki pants when fleece vests were popular a few years later gap had them in a rainbow of colors everyone seemed to own a classic gap pocket tshirt or two yet the brand always a symbol of affordable style also appealed to fashionistas actress sharon stone wore a black gap mock turtleneck to the  oscars supermodels donned white gap jeans and shirts on the cover of vogue magazine in  between  and  companywide sales rocketed from  billion to  billion those stunning results were driven in part by the breathtaking success of the old navy chains inexpensive wares at the same time the banana republic chainwhich in  shed its original safari theme in favor of a more sophisticated urban aestheticalso sizzled alienating longtime customers but by the end of  the gap brand and old navy were suffering sharp growing pains under millard s mickey drexler the companys ceo at the time the two chains overexpanded longterm debt ballooned from  million to  billion in  simultaneously the usually trendsavvy drexler oversaw a series of fashion missteps in particular veering toward superhip clothes that alienated longtime customers earnings sank and in  drexler was pushed out along came pressler a year walt disney co dis  veteran he had risen to the chairmanship of the companys amusement parks and resorts unit by nature a methodical thinker say people who worked under him at disney pressler embraced market analyses and other research to help him understand consumer spending patterns he also imposed strict cost controls that irked his creative staff at disney he never had to deal with the creative qualitative side of design observes steve roukis managing director at matrix asset advisors which holds about  million gap shares gap could not have been happier with its new leader paul knows how to lead creative customerfocused organizations said gap founder donald g fisher in a statement announcing presslers hiring once at gap pressler who wore neat jeans jackets and a ready smile came across as a likable and approachable manager anyone whos ever met paul agrees hes a nice guy says a former gap insider so the honeymoon began at the start pressler had the benefit of excellent timing clothing designed during drexlers final year on the job was starting to appear in stores and did well sales rose at the gap brand and companywide for more than a year earnings shot up too pressler went on a hiring spree bringing in a handful of former disney colleagues including chief financial officer byron h pollitt jr who paid down debt and restored the companys credit rating to investmentgrade status pressler also hired another exdisney coworker eva sagegavin to lead human resources it was gaps longstanding corporate culture that caught presslers attention early on at the time the nononsense corporate mantra was own it do it get it done but pressler thought this ethos didnt sufficiently promote collaboration he set out to promote a new environment built around the slogan purpose values and behaviors among the catchphrases were bromides such as explore create and exceed together pamphlets promoting communication and teamwork landed on employees desks posters and banners trumpeting the bland new slogans went up around headquarters in the beginning people were very receptive to the effort says alan j barocas the companys former senior vicepresident for real estate it was embraced but eyerolling started as the initiative began consuming a lot of time former employees say they had to sit through countless meetings workshops and roleplaying seminars where pressler and his hr executives discussed the new culture many staffers felt they were wasting their time in gettogethers that didnt address the crucial matter of creating and marketing clothes hr was out of control says a former insider over the next couple of years employees also felt bogged down in what they thought were unnecessary meetings with cfo pollitt with presslers blessing pollitt demanded highly detailed presentations that explained minutiae managers thought were far too detailed for a cfo such as the margins on individual products or the costs of decorative trims confabs with pollitt were the antithesis of being creative and nimble it was talking about the work vs doing the work says a former employee gap said that pollitt declined to comment despite presslers expertise and comfort with the operational side of the company some of his initiatives in that area also backfired in  he kicked off a plan to remake the retailers supply chain one goal was to combine fabric purchases across all three of the companys brands which had previously used separate suppliers pressler wanted to cut costs and speed the flow of merchandise from drawing board to store shelf but the effort stumbled since all three brands sell jeans made of denim in late  they began purchasing it together but the big buying deals yielded denim of a single quality weave and weight that meant all three brands were limited to one kind of fabric even though with their different audiences they needed to be able to offer an array of jeans and with all that denim ordered in advance there was less incentive for designers to keep their eyes open so they could jump on the next great style jeans made with material from the pooled purchases ended up largely falling flat and the joint purchasing effort was abandoned raising eyebrows as part of the supply chain revamping pressler also tinkered with the way the gap brand produced clothing samples these prototypes had long been made at studios in manhattans garment district but pressler moved samplemaking to asia where the companys many suppliers are located with that change designers had to create patterns ship them to asia get the samples back make changes and ship them back to be remade while making samples in asia was cheaper than in new york it delayed the process and made you less nimble says a former insider aggravating matters the company instituted a new costcutting rule no overnight shipping to asia without highlevel approval the summer of  brought a pivotal change pressler reassigned gap brand head gary p muto to lead forth  towne the new store aimed at women older than  while he searched to fill the hole at the top of the namesake division pressler led the gap brand himself the move raised eyebrows among employees who worried about his lack of experience in apparel their fears were confirmed the gap brand needed someone to referee when designers disagreed with the merchants a common occurrence at retailers everywhere designers constantly push the limits toward edgier styles merchants must make sure that whatever lands in their stores sells to the brands mainstream audience while pressler encouraged designers and merchants to work together there was no tiebreaker he made it clear that he didnt want to be that person says a former employee offthemark market research even more frustrating were presslers contributions during line reviews where designers present clothing samples for a future season and storeset meetings where storedesign staff show proposed merchandise displays according to former employees presslers suggestions were frequently phrased as questions typical of one do you think it would be better to move the denim to the middle wall afterwards meetings would end and no one had a clue what hed said says one former insider we all had opinions and it would be a bicker and a fight all hell would break loose the first clothes produced under presslers leadership of the gap brand started to reach shelves in the spring of  but even supported by an advertising blitz fronted by actress sarah jessica parker the brands sales fell  that spring and summer one sore spot was presslers directive to use the findings of the research staff known as the consumer insights group that he had created some designers and merchants didnt believe that the groups outputwhich included findings from consumer focus groups polls and surveys of customers and store employeeswas particularly useful in the fashion business because consumers arent good at predicting what theyll buy in the future paul didnt know how to interact with the design team who didnt react to the science being imposed on them says an exemployee the constant disagreements delayed determining final designs ideas for any given season pingponged back and forth entire collections were made and altered and then reworked sometimes several times over with no decisionmaker wed go back and forth and change and redo and then wed be out of time before orders had to be placed or stores would have empty shelves says a former insider in the thhour crunch staffers would end up falling back on lowestcommondenominator items bland styles that they hoped would please everyone but risked pleasing no one last august for instance gap heavily promoted the good old safe tshirt hawking it as the ultimate vehicle for selfexpression the campaign didnt reverse the brands ongoing sales decline which that fall clocked in at  meanwhile the search for a gap brand head was dragging on pressure to fill the job was mounting a presentation to wall street analysts on apr   was fast approaching and a gaping hole in the executive lineup wouldnt go over well three days before the meeting pressler announced his choice cynthia harriss a former disney colleague he hired  months earlier to lead the gap outlet unit representing a sliver of the companys total sales harriss had little bigtime fashion experience shed worked for disneys retail stores for five years before moving to its resorts business in  while she had worked for  years at paul harris stores inc a midwestern apparel chain its annual sales were well under  billion compared with the gap brands  billion arun daniel senior consumer analyst at ing investment management ing  which holds about  million gap shares considers the promotion of harriss to be one of presslers critical mistakes he needed a strong no  in merchandising says daniel cynthia harriss was an operations person under harriss the presslerstyle management of the brand continued through the rest of  and beyond say former employees she made no decisions says one she defaulted to paul who made no decisions harriss declined requests to comment the clock was ticking by the end of  speculation was widespread that pressler whod won the nickname dead man walking on wall street would soon be on his way out chairman fisher though publicly supported pressler calling him the right person to lead this company nonetheless industry watchers predicted that  would be presslers last shot at a turnaround sales declines at the gap brand were widening reaching an  drop in the first quarter of fiscal  the tumult dragged on ad campaigns came and went including last falls commercials for black pants that used footage of audrey hepburn they failed to reverse the sales declines that wall street had come to expect in november the companys credit rating dropped back into junk territory and holiday sales for the gap brand plummeted  the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up it came as no great surprise when the company said pressler and the board have mutually
