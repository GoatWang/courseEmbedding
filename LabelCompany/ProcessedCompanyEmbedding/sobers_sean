everyone thanks for joining us today q of  marked another excellent quarter for quantenna please note that this was our first full quarter as a publicly held company today we have a lot of good news to share with you and i appreciate your interest and support in quantenna let us start by briefly reviewing our q financial highlights im pleased to report that quantenna produced record revenues delivering  million for the first quarter this represents an impressive  growth over the first quarter of  and to add we have a strong balance sheet with  million in cash regarding quantennas product mix our ac wave  performed well and we expect incremental growth in q that will exceed its record q level further our n product saw continued strength in q that was driven by increased market share finally our g wave  revenue continued to grow as we have seen increasing interest from our customers and we expect this momentum to continue through the rest of the year during the first quarter we had three announcements across our ecosystem that reinforced our position as the leading provider of the highest performing wifi technology on the planet first we announced the qsrgax this is a followon product to industrys first ax introduction or stream qsrgax the qsrg leverages quantenna proprietary architecture and is ready to take advantage of our customer pipeline and established footprint of ac solutions we expect this product to position us well for success in the mainstream wifi market we expect our gax and our gax will be critical new products for the next generation of wifi convergence to the next standards will take time to unfold as has been the case historically but we anticipate to be the first to the market and ready to lead our customers to a better wifi experience second we introduced a carriergrade fullduplex wifi range extender with greenwave systems and finally we introduced soniq or self optimizing network software that unites various network devices coupled with our semiconductor solution for residential gateways repeaters and video clients soniq can transform the home wifi experience via an intelligently managed network it will detect and route the best connection for any of your client devices in addition im also excited to report that in the first quarter we sold past the shipment of our  millionth wifi chip this is a major milestone that represents over a decade of intense development efforts led by our worldclass team this milestone demonstrates a scalable operational efficiency as you may recall what makes our wifi technology unique on the last call we discussed what makes our wifi technology unique on the last call this is demonstrated on slide  of the earnings presentation now i would like to take an opportunity to share with the investors the market growth forecast for premium wifi solution if you refer to slide  we have a chart that shows our market opportunity abi research forecasts that the nonportable wifi enabled devices that have x mimo technology or greater which we define as premium will grow from  million in  to  billion in  that is a  compound annual growth rate even though we dont separately break this out the x mimo market is expected to have a more impressive growth rate of  compound annual growth from  through  please note that we are still the only x solution currently offered now i would like to turn the call over to sean sean sobers thanks sam and good afternoon everyone as vern previously stated our financial commentary should be referenced in conjunction with both my remarks and the earnings press release issued today we are pleased to report record revenue of  million in the first quarter this represents  growth over the first quarter last year and is up  sequentially from the fourth quarter of  the sequential growth was particularly strong given the typical seasonal industry softness experienced in q also let me remind you that q  was an extended week quarter and q  we are back to our normal week quarter taking this into account and adjusting for the extra week the sequential growth over q would have been  our first quarter gross margin was in line with our expectations at  and declined  basis points sequentially but gained  basis points yearoveryear as we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call our gross margin is typically impacted by mix our operating expenses were in line with our expectations reflecting increased staffing levels and costs associated with being a public company that were recognized in sales and marketing and ga rd expenses declined sequentially due to the timing of development projects we used  in cash from operations in the first quarter or  per share due to expanding our working capital as the business continues to grow our nongaap eps which excludes stockbased compensation was  for the first quarter compared to  for the fourth quarter of  and a loss of  in the first quarter of  turning to our balance sheet we closed q  with  million in cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable ended at  million or  days sales outstanding this compares to  million or  days in q  this increase was primarily due to the timing of customer payments inventory ended at  million or  annualized turns in the first quarter compared to  million or  annualized turns in the fourth quarter this decline was due to heavier shipments of our legacy products coupled with an inventory decline due to improving operational efficiencies now for a discussion of revenue segmentation by wifi technology as we anticipated our ac wave  product declined  sequentially in q due to typical seasonal softness from our customers as well as one less week in the first quarter relative to the fourth wave  products doubled over the first quarter of  growing  yearoveryear due to continued strong customer interest we anticipate wave  revenue to grow sequentially in q and exceed our q levels our legacy n revenue grew  sequentially in the first quarter on relatively smaller revenue levels as a result of increased market share n products declined  yearoveryear in the first quarter in line with our overall expectations that this product area will decline over time our wave  g product grew from  of revenue in the fourth quarter to  in the first quarter or  million while still relatively small to our overall revenue we expect wave  revenue to grow sequentially in q and continue to grow throughout the second half of  as service providers ramp design wins into volume production i will now cover our guidance for the second quarter of  as the second quarter progresses we have seen continued demand from our customers for our ac wave  products coupled with the ramp of our g products taking this into consideration we expect second quarter revenue to be between  million and  million we expect our product mix to improve in the second quarter accordingly we anticipate our nongaap gross margin for the second quarter to be between  and  however as we have stated in our prior call we anticipate the gross margin on our g product will be below the corporate average until we complete cost optimization efforts toward the end of  thus gross margin performance may fluctuate in the second half of  in q we plan to invest in rd and add incremental headcount as well as incur increased expenses related to development projects note that our rd expenses will generally fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of these projects also we anticipate sales and marketing and ga to grow modestly thus we expect second quarter operating expenses to grow  to  sequentially with rd accounting for most of this increase in the second quarter we expect tax expenses to be in the range of  to  so to summarize for the second quarter we anticipate a gaap loss of  to  per share and the nongaap eps to be between  and  please refer to our gaap to nongaap business outlook reconciliation contained in our earnings release for more information we are excited about our revenue growth as the demand for our products continues finally i would also like to note that while we understand there is interest related to our large service provider customers we do not plan to share specifics about our customer relationships therefore we will not be discussing or updating specific design wins or details with investors on a regular basis we appreciate your understanding i would like to now turn the call over to sam for concluding remarks sam heidari thank you sean as i discussed earlier on the call we continue to work diligently to bring the best wifi experience with service providers strategically we are finding our efforts are much more readily monetized in this area relative to retail and enterprise of course we are still working closely with key partners in both retail and enterprise market we continue to partner with our service provider customers as they broaden their presence in the residential market they are absorbing a very dynamic market here such as traditional cable operators that are quadbundling mobile phone services and satellite operators being bought by mobile carriers for us this presents a significant opportunity the key to this augmentation often therefore is a very reliable and highperformance wifi fabric because of our positioning the market is rapidly moving toward us for example if you were to look at one of our key target markets the residential hotspots the growth is exceptional according to cisco total wifi residential hotspots will grow from  million in  to  million in  this represents a  compound annual growth over the fiveyear period quantenna is not just participating in this growth we are enabling it if you think we are crazy about wifi you are right but you are not alone in a recent study conducted by comcast xfinity  of multiunit residential managers ranked wifi as an amenity thats most important to their renters this compared to just  who identified inroom laundry facilities wifi could soon be considered a utility just like electricity and running water so in summary we are very proud of our heritage of enabling the bestinclass wifi solution that improves everyones life we just posted a backtoback record revenue in the quarter and announced a strong outlook for q we have a portfolio of leadingedge products that are capturing the market needs of today and tomorrow we couldnt be more excited about our future and finally we have a great team that brings their agame to work every day i couldnt be more proud of that now this concludes our prepared remarks we would like to open the call for your questions stephanie questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from suji desilva with roth capital suji desilva congratulations on the strong results here as a gate and also congratulations on making  million units i wanted to ask about the unit number here its about  million two quarters ago it was about  million that metric helps us kind of understand your unit shipments can you talk about how we should think about blended asp along with that in the trend any puts and takes we should think about as you roll out the newer products and multiple products sean sobers i think as we discussed in the past asps are climbing as we migrate towards g thats for two reasons one overall the higher end and higher performance but youre also getting more real estate from the overall chipset so we are having both  ghz and  ghz before our products were only  ghz so if you think about asp as you migrate to g you are seeing around doubling of that if not more suji desilva okay good and then in terms of the competitive landscape can you give us a sense versus three months ago and your thoughts there competitors certainly are trying to catch up to you and then what youre seeing in the design competitions that you have encountered more recently sam heidari so as far as we are concerned today i mean easily we are still the only x product out there offering in the designs we have not seen any evidence of any other product having been in our customers hand so we are leading that meanwhile we are continuing to ship and win even new design wins with our legacy x solution suji desilva very good and then last quick question you talked about carriergrade extender sam is that a meaningful incremental market opportunity for you guys and would that show up in whatever interface and protocol its handling or would it be a separate line item help us understand if thats something we should be paying attention to as an incremental opportunity sam heidari so the entry to the market i dont think that is going to be identified as a separate line item for the time being i dont think it will have – and it is definitely a – the significance of that and importance of that is it provides a complete solution to the service providers and their end customers as a onestop shop but it is going to be maybe more meaningful in the years to come i dont see it in  suji desilva okay fair enough thanks guys congrats again operator your next question comes from quinn bolton with needham  company quinn bolton i want to echo my congratulations on the strong results and guidance sean just wanted to come through the guidance for the second quarter you said that wave  would be back to or above record levels from the fourth quarter so it sounds like wave  solution should be about  million or better i think you said n would decline and that was around  million so it kind of sounds like the core business is probably somewhere around  million if thats right it sounds like the wave  or g solution could be anywhere from about  million to  million in the second quarter and i just want to make sure that thats kind of the right expectation you are setting or do you think that the wave  ac stuff sees some significant growth above the previous q  record level sean sobers its a very good question and you do know how to do math very well but were not going to be more specific than what we said earlier we are expecting over time obviously on the wave  g product to continue to grow and grow significantly but i cant give you any more specifics sam heidari we did say that wave  will be higher than q sean sobers yes exactly quinn bolton okay and then i guess just with your mixing towards the g solutions yet your gross margin sort of uptick in the second quarter despite that mix towards the g solution can you tell us whats going on in wave  product line thats standing for the better mix shift or is the g solutions coming a little bit better than perhaps previously expected sean sobers so i mean we talk a lot about kind of the three pieces n and then wave  ac and then wave  or g ac when we talk about it on that level inside that level there is a multiple chipset that could make up different product sets that have different profiles so when the product mix is in there and it comes in differently it can have a different impact on the overall outcome but theres nothing – were still working towards cost optimization on the g product as we progress through the end of  quinn bolton okay and then just one more for sam and then ill hop back in the queue just sam what are you seeing in terms of demand for the x mimo youre still the only provider with x on the market are service providers kind of waiting for kind of first design wins for x to ramp before making their decisions or are you already layering in additional x design wins on top of your initial qsrg ramp sam heidari quinn if i may go back to the conversations we have had at the time of ipo even as earlier as a couple of months ago i stated how many different service providers are there in deployment and the new ones which are coming on which we kind of showed that landscape to you before we talked about  at the time being deploying service providers and we have about  overall design wins in deployment so a good number of them are coming up a good number of the ones which are coming up are x design wins so x is getting good traction in the market today and we expect multiples of this going to deployment this year and then follow up to be by the following year quinn bolton great thanks for the additional color operator your next question comes from blayne curtis with barclays blayne curtis ill echo my congrats as well sean just wanted to go back on the prior question i know you dont want to breakout specific numbers but it sounded like with the opex line going up im assuming thats a tapeout so maybe if you could just talk about the timing of wave  is it progressing as you expected and have talked about prior and then if you are taping out the cost down is that also going to – can you talk about the timing of that and the impact to the gross margin sean sobers so you are right in a sense that the developments that are happening in rd when we talk about projects those are generally tapeouts were not going to talk about specifically which one but we are tracking in what we believe we forecasted for the full year as it relates to g and when the costdown is going to come as well as when the revenue ramp is going to come so no real changes there from anything we talked about or thought about in the past blayne curtis okay and maybe you could just talk about the strength youre expecting in june in wave  coming back where are you seeing that strength from sean sobers i think generally its across our customer base we have quite a few service providers that are in rollout and ramping up across their customer base so we can have a view to whats going to happen in q obviously were halfway through q as we speak right now so we have a good visibility towards whats going to happen in the quarter blayne curtis perfect and then just the opex guidance for june just want to make sure i understand the moving pieces obviously youre a small company and tapeouts can matter so march was depressed it was lower than expected now june is with  million how do you think about that opex line in the back half of the year sean sobers and i think you are right on the impacts of the tapeouts are going to be the things that fluctuate mostly obviously were a company thats growing pretty rapidly above  so hiring is going to be a big portion of that as well so those are the big drivers the focus areas for expense growth is going to come out of rd its not going to be for the most part sales and marketing and ga but as tapeouts happen and hiring comes thats where the driver is going to be operator your next question comes from joe moore with morgan stanley joe moore with regards to the g product it seems like its a differentiated product for the retail market as well and it seems like there would be demand for that can you talk about any potential milestones we may see in terms of their ability to just start ramping more of a presence in the retail router market sam heidari as we have mentioned earlier retail is an opportunistic market for us we definitely have our eyes on it we have been engaged with a toptier retail oem and we execute towards having a presence there it is going to be – in a shorter term i think its not going to be a significant portion of our revenue and in the longer term it will be meaningful but not significant portion of our revenue our focus today i think that is service provider market is growing very rapidly and we are going to leverage from there what we have into the retail market when there is an opportunity joe moore okay great and then in the service provider market there were a bunch of supply disruptions earlier in the year around one of their customers struggled to get dram and another one was struggling to get chipsets and obviously youve grown nicely through that but have you seen any impact of that supplychain disruption and is there any effect on your either q or q numbers sean sobers this is sean no we havent actually seen any impact of that i mean we were obviously getting similar questions as we were going through closing our q and such but we havent seen any impact to us on that case joe moore great thank you and congratulations operator your next question comes from anil doradla with william blair anil doradla sam and team congrats from my end too so sam when you deal with the service providers today and there are discussions that you have with them the choices are between different mimo streams between wave  and wave  can you share some insights into kind of the types of discussions or some of the criteria that is pushing these service providers in configuring their mimo streams versus wave  and wave  right now sam heidari so the problem statement has been the same and it is i think what you hear from the service provider is very clear the wifi connectivity is frequently linked usually in the full network and the devices performance and the bandwidth into the home is judged based on an endtoend measurement of the throughput so when they select a technology its not just about x versus x which i think x contributes significantly toward the right direction and better performance of the system its about guaranteeing the whole home coverage futureproofing it for the services reducing the service cost and being able to advertise the differentiation of their network compared to someone else and these are the fundamental needs which have been indicated for the past few years that weve been in the business and weve foreseen it to be the reason for going forward and it includes all those things that i mentioned that is it differentiates us and is needed for service providers anil doradla what i was hoping sam is that is it like a tipping point like when you talk about x is it  gigabit per second that people the service providers are pushing at x or is there some bandwidth requirements where a certain mimo constellation is made in sam heidari right so i think that  gigabit per second for example or you take any number  megabits per second for entire home coverage its still going to get a benefit from x because x is going to take that curve further out in your home coverage at the same time within the home communication going from one device to another doing a backup and your home networking channel within the home is going to take a benefit of the higher throughput that x analysis has to offer at the same time the wifi is a shared medium you share the frequency with your neighbors so the faster you can communicate the more air time you can free up in order to help your neighbors or not to get hurt by your neighbors by being able to transmit your packet and open a slot over the air all of these are the reasons that x gets selected today anil doradla okay and finally when do you think competition will come in with x solutions you said you are the only guys there today thanks a lot sam heidari right so i mean last earnings call we had a conversation about that based on the news release we have not seen anything otherwise since then and i might add we have had this product for a couple of years it does take time to mature it so we think that there is a level of lead time for us here still because of our maturity of the product as coming together anil doradla congrats guys operator your next question comes from ross seymore with regiment ross seymore just wanted to look first in the quarter you got substance ph of your guidance nicely what was the cause of that sean sobers so a big driver perhaps in general on growth is going to be service providers introducing new products and rolling out them across their customer base so i think thats kind of general but we do see the growth is going to be coming from wave  ac as well as g as we migrate towards the back half of the year obviously both of those are somewhat of a driver as it relates to qs activity as well ross seymore so a similar question the n market share gains little surprised that that performed so well i know you said earlier that it will go down over time but what led to the market share gains there in what i would assume to be a more competitive market sean sobers on the n side its actually a smaller group of customers there and we have one customer in particular go and convert kind of an older sku that wasnt quantenna into a quantenna sku so now they are only selling quantenna wifi so that was able for us to capture market share that way it did have somewhat of a meaningful impact i guess when you look at what n has done historically recent and near quarters too what was able to be done in q but we think over time as with all the standard products they migrate on to the next generation from n to ac and then ac to ax ross seymore then the last question one for sam and you touched on this a little bit earlier about the g product but i just wondered if in lieu of talking about one specific customer or any specific customer which i know youre not going to do can you talk a little bit about the breadth of adoption of the x solutions and is there any way for us to judge by the number of service providers that are adopting that to get a good idea of what the revenue trajectory of the company may be going forward and also as a sign of the competitive intensity and your ability to stay ahead of those competitors sam heidari right so we do have a definite lead against the competitors today and these design wins that we have mentioned earlier with the service providers are very sticky and for the longterm so the ones that you establish and go to deployment you get to deploy them for a while so now if you want to quantify that the numbers of the design wins that we are talking about right now are intense so there are a meaningful number of the design wins that are going to convert to x as a function of time so i mean thats all i can tell you about but it is not a novelty number of designs ross seymore great congrats guys thanks operator there are no further questions i will now turn it back over to sam sam heidari thank you on the behalf of quantenna worldwide team i would like
