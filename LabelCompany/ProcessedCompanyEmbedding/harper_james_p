james harper associate professorpsb  lab psb 76jamesharperucfeducurriculum vitae research areassyllabivideo research the primary research goal in our laboratory is the nmr characterization of structure in solids that are difficult or impossible to examine by more conventional techniques  the relevance of our methods is perhaps best demonstrated by our recent characterization of the complete crystal structure of catechin a ubiquitous and extensively studied antioxidant that had defied characterization for nearly a century  this nmr work emphasizes c and n shift tensor measurements and relies on computational chemistry methods to tie these results to structure  a secondary area of emphasis involves the search for novel bioactive fungal products with a special focus on identifying unusual antioxidants  work is each of these areas is described below    nmr crystallography – prediction of complete crystal structures for intractable materials  conventional crystallographic techniques are often unable to provide structure in materials  the typical limitation lies in difficulty in growing suitable crystals  we have recently demonstrated that accurate crystal structure can often be established without single crystals or even diffraction data if a combination of solidstate nmr and a theoretically crystal structure prediction process are used  remarkably the structures now being solved in our lab with this methodology and powdered solids rival or surpass the accuracy of single crystal diffraction data  this approach promises to open new areas of structural analysis in challenging materials and studies are underway with the goal of characterizing high profile pharmaceuticals that have long defied traditional analysis    design of superior free radical scavengers  some effort in our lab involves searching for bioactive fungi within higher plants ie endophytic fungi  these “bioprospecting” studies have now identified several fungal products that have superb antioxidant activity  some of these molecules have unique modes of action as indicated by mechanistic studies involving computational modeling  presently the products we have examined are unsuited for pharmaceutical use but it appears that the structural features creating the activity can be reproduced in more favorable products  computational testing is now underway on a wide variety of candidate antioxidants with the goal of identifying superior radical scavengers with more favorable biocompatibility citations harper j k doebbler j a jacques e grant d m
