and accounts receivable by recording certain transactions with its distributors and resellers as sales when in fact the transactions did not meet the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for sales at the end of each quarter clearone would sweep the floor of its inventory stuff the distribution channels with clearone products and force distributors to accept product that they did not want clearone would then enter into undisclosed verbal agreements with its distributors and resellers whereby the distributors and resellers agreed to pay for the clearone merchandise as it was sold rather than in accordance with the written contracts clearone had with those entities  clearones improper accounting treatment of these transactions and revenue recognition

customers flood devised the channel stuffing scheme and entered into these arrangements with distributors and resellers of clearone products in order for clearone to meet its quarterly and annual revenue and sales projections  strohm clearones cfo knew that clearone dumped products into the distribution channel at the end of each quarter and fiscal in order to meet revenue targets strohm also

customers strohm allowed clearone to materially overstate revenue income and accounts receivable on the companys financial statements filed with the commission statutes and rules alleged to have been

these rules were in effect at all times relevant hereto and are still in effect defendants  clearone is a utah corporation with its principal place of business at  research way salt lake city utah  clearone is a provider of endtoend video and audio conferencing services including the manufacture and sale of video and audio conferencing products  frances m flood age  is the chairman of the board president and ceo of clearone flood joined clearone in october  as vice president of sales and marketing flood became president of clearone in december  and ceo in june  flood then became chairman of the board in november   susie strohm age  joined clearone in february  as company controller strohm was named chief financial officer in  strohm stepped down briefly as cfo in august  in the fall of  strohm again took the reins as cfo between august  and september  strohm continued to serve as clearones vice president of finance and controller background  from its inception as a manufacturer of audio and video conferencing equipment through  clearone sold its products through a nationwide network of manufacturers representatives  sometime in early  clearone made the decision to alter its business model and instead of utilizing manufacturers representatives clearone began selling its products through a nationwide network of distributors complemented by a direct sales force  initially clearone had two major distributors of its audio and video conferencing products vso marketing based in fairfield new jersey and starin marketing located in chesterton indiana later clearone added two other distributors ptt in california and newcomm distributing located in pennsylvania  clearone also sold its products directly to resellers of video and audio conferencing products through a direct sales force  the distributors had a written distributor agreement with clearone that provided specific payment terms for each distributor usually requiring the distributor to pay clearone within  days of receiving clearone products  the distributor agreement also required the individual distributors to take title to clearone products at the time those products left clearones utah warehouse  the distributor agreement provided that the individual distributors had no right to return the clearone products that they received  clearone recognized revenue from product sales and booked accounts receivable at the time the products were shipped from the companys warehouse according to clearone it transferred the risks and rewards including title to its products at that time the fraud begins  through early  clearone experienced robust growth and increased product sales every quarter however in early  it became apparent to flood that clearone would not meet its sales and revenue projections for the quarter ended march    in order to meet sales projections flood devised a scheme for stuffing the distribution channel with clearone products as soon as those products left clearones warehouse clearone would record sales on its books  thus if clearone shipped enough product the last week of a quarter then it could meet revenue projections  at the end of march  flood instructed clearones director of manufacturing william olpin to assemble enough products to ship to distributors so that it would appear that clearone actually met its sales projections flood instructed olpin to sweep the floor meaning to send all the clearone inventory onhand as well as everything he could manufacture to distributors to meet the quarterly sales projections  flood found a home for this inventory with one of clearones distributors starin marketing starin agreed to accept a large shipment of clearone products during the last week of march  flood had an secret agreement with starin that he would not have to pay for that merchandise until he sold it flood told starin that the transaction presented absolutely no risk to him  contrary to gaap clearone recognized revenue and booked an account receivable for that transaction a pattern emerges  clearones pattern of stuffing the distribution channel with its products and entering into secret agreements with its distributors continued each fiscal quarter thereafter  at the end of each fiscal quarter once clearone realized that it was not going to meet its revenue and sales projections clearone would repeat the same pattern of stuffing the distribution channel and entering into secret agreements with resellers or distributors  flood instructed olpin again each quarter to increase manufacturing during the last week of the quarter to produce enough products to meet projections flood often through timothy morrison vice president of product sales or misty chalk national sales manager would communicate with clearone distributors and tell them how much product they needed to accept in order for clearone to meet projections  morrison or chalk would reiterate the agreement that flood originally made with the distributors that they did not have to pay for the clearone merchandise until it was sold to third parties  each quarter flood would also reassure the distributors directly that they would not have to pay for the inventory forced upon them by clearone  the distributors then would send clearone a blank purchase order that clearone would fill with whatever inventory it had on hand and then ship that inventory to the distributors often these endofquarter shipments consisted of products that the distributors did not want and could not sell  at the end of june  starin marketing agreed to accept  worth of clearone products to assist clearone in making its yearend sales figures flood instructed james starin to write a purchase order with the requirement that payment be made within  days flood also directed starin to tell clearones outside auditors that the product was shipped to starin on those terms  flood however verbally assured starin that he took the product without any risk and that he would not have to pay clearone until the product sold flood reminded starin not to tell clearones auditors about the pay as you sell agreement  again at the end of september  the end of clearones first fiscal quarter for the year  clearone again came up short of its projected sales and revenue figures flood instructed morrison to ship  of product to vso marketing on the last day of the quarter starin marketing received an equivalent shipment at that time neither starin nor vso was required to pay clearone until the products sold  at the end of september  flood also contacted longtime friend mike peppel ceo of mcsi inc and requested that he assist clearone in meeting its quarterly projections peppel agreed to accept a last minute shipment of clearone products just like starin marketing and vso mcsi was not required to pay clearone until the product sold  despite knowing that the sales were merely sham transactions clearone recognized revenue and booked an account receivable for that merchandise before the quarters end  in december  clearone added two new distributors newcomm distribution and ptt  at the end of december  clearone shipped an additional  of inventory to both newcomm and ptt with the understanding that neither company was required to pay for the products until they sold them  this pattern of behavior by clearone continued each quarter with clearone forcing inventory on all of its distributors always on the pay as you sell plan and always to allow clearone to meet expectations  by the end of june  clearone fell short of meeting revenue and sales projections  in order to meet the sales projections flood again contacted peppel at mcsi and asked for another favor  clearone shipped  million in inventory to mcsi at the end of june  clearone booked revenue of  million mcsi was not required to pay for the inventory until it sold through to its customers  at the same time in june of  flood invented yet another way to dispose of inventory she simply found someone who was willing to hide inventory in his garage clearone shipped  vthere video conferencing units to a nondistributor those units were stored at the nondistributors home and he was not required to pay clearone unless he sold the units  clearone invoiced the nondistributor  each for the vthere units recognizing an aggregate of  in revenue this  unit price was much higher than the usual price charged to distributors of vthere units ultimately the nondistributor attempted to return all the vthere units to clearone  at the end of june  clearone also invoiced each of its distributors newcomm ptt vso marketing and starin marketing for at least  of vlabs starter kits as was typical flood told each distributor it was not required to pay for the starter kits until the inventory sold to one of their customers the distributors never even received the vlabs starter kits instead the starter kits were purportedly stored in a minneapolis warehouse  before the end of the quarter and the fiscal year ended june   clearone recognized revenue of at least  from hiding the vlab starter kits in that minneapolis warehouse  by the end of june  approximately  of the revenue claimed by clearone in that quarter resulted from inventory stuffed in the distribution channels or sitting in a warehouse or garage  in addition to receiving inventory that they did not want distributors also received inventory that was outdated or obsolete  for example the vthere video conferencing units had poor picture quality and did not sell well at the end of at least one quarter clearone dumped a large quantity of vthere units on each of its distributors again agreeing that the distributors did not have to pay for the product until it sold to customers  clearone also invoiced distributors for products at a price higher than agreed upon for example clearone sent kodak video conferencing units to its distributors and invoiced them at dealer cost rather than the discounted price typically charged to a distributor clearone then recorded revenue at the dealer cost  clearones channel stuffing was not limited to the united states on at least one occasion in june  clearone delivered over  million of inventory to an australian reseller of clearone video and audio conferencing products  the australian company refused to retrieve the clearone products from a bonded warehouse in australia ultimately clearone was forced to look for other ways to rid itself of the inventory shipped to australia  however clearone recorded revenue and booked an account receivable at the time the clearone products left its warehouse flood and strohm mislead auditors analysts and investors  clearone was concerned about maintaining the historical growth in sales and revenue and its stock price clearone also needed to maintain its stock price during its important private offering that closed december   that private placement raised  million for the company  flood expressed her concern to morrison and other clearone employees that clearones stock price remain high in order for clearone to close on important acquisitions or to close the private placement  in order to maintain the façade of a healthy company with robust sales and revenues flood instructed clearone employees including among others morrison chalk and strohm to mislead analysts or investors  specifically flood told clearone employees not to discuss the channel stuffing that took place at the end of every quarter in addition flood instructed individuals at clearone not to talk about the secret agreements with distributors if asked employees were not to tell anyone that distributors could wait and pay for products when the products sold rather that to pay clearone in accordance with the distribution agreements  flood also communicated the same message to the distributors the distributors were told that if they received a call from an investor or analyst they should simply confirm the payment terms set forth in the distribution agreement and under no circumstance should they mention that the distributors could wait and pay clearone for its products at the time the products sold  flood and strohm also instructed clearone employees including among others tim morrison to mislead clearones independent auditor ernst  young llp  flood told morrison that he should not tell ernst  young about the secret agreements that flood had made with the distributors or resellers morrison was also told that he should remain silent about the channel stuffing the occurred at the end of every quarter  strohm attended the meetings between morrison and ernst  young to ensure that morrison did not disclose the channel stuffing or secret agreements  during all this time flood led investors the public and the market to believe that clearone continued to experience revenue growth and increased sales  on july   clearone issued a press release with financial guidance for the fiscal year ended june   in that press release flood indicated that regular checks with clearones distribution channels indicate    orders continue at a healthy rate flood however knew that statement was false because she ordered clearone to stuff product in the distribution channel and allowed distributors to pay as items sold  on april   clearone announced its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year  in a press release flood touted clearones increased product sales noting a  percent increase of course flood failed to disclose that much of that increase was attributable to products stuffed into distribution channels and unsold inventory located in distributors warehouses  also in the april   press release flood noted the significant increase in clearones accounts receivable balance flood attributed the significant increase in part to the addition of  new dealers that statement was false the addition of new dealers did not cause the astronomical increase in accounts receivable rather clearones channel stuffing quarter after quarter and the side agreements with distributors was the true source of the increase  on august   clearone issued another press release in which it reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended june   in that press release clearone indicated product sales for the fourth quarter were up  percent to  million that statement was false a large portion of the increase in sales simply reflected clearones recognition of revenue on shipments of products stuffed into the distribution channel and sent to distributors or resellers who had no obligation to pay for the product until it was sold  that august  press release also stated that product sales grew  percent in fiscal year  that statement was false by that time approximately  million of inventory had been stuffed into the distribution channel in fact clearone had experienced essentially no growth in sales clearones financial statements contain material overstatements  in addition to the false press releases touting the companys success the companys financial statements contained materially overstated revenue income and accounts receivable figures  as a result of its improper revenue recognition policies including channel stuffing and secret agreements with resellers and distributors clearones accounts receivable balance grew exponentially clearone knew that this balance was not collectible because the distributors were not obligated to pay many of clearones products were not selling and millions in inventory simply sat in warehouses and garages around the country  despite knowing that the ballooning accounts receivable balance was the result of the channel stuffing and payasyougo agreements with distributors and resellers flood and strohm fabricated an explanation for the huge increase in accounts receivable they attributed the ballooning accounts receivable balance to the addition of new distributors or to late shipments  both as cfo and as vice president of finance strohm had responsibility for preparing clearones financial statements  flood told strohm about the payasyougo arrangements she had entered into with the distributors in fact in june  when strohm first learned about the channel stuffing and secret agreements with distributors strohm requested to step down as cfo and accepted a demotion to controller strohm stepped down so that she would not be required to sign clearones annual and quarterly reports filed with the commission  despite knowledge of the payasyougo arrangements with distributors and the channel stuffing strohm continued to allow clearone to book revenue and record accounts receivable for clearone products as the were shipped from clearones warehouse  strohm knew that the risks and rewards associated with much of the inventory did not transfer at that time because the distributors receiving the products did not have to pay for them until the products sold through to their customers  strohm knowingly employed accounting methods that violated gaap and resulted in clearones financial statements materially overstating revenue income and accounts receivable  for the fiscal year ended june   clearones improper revenue recognition policies channel stuffing and secret agreements with distributors and resellers resulted in at least a  overstatement of clearones net income  those materially misstated financial statements were included in the forms q filed with the commission for the quarters ended march   september   december   march   and september   and in the forms k for the fiscal years ended june   and june   the materially misstated financial statements were also incorporated by reference in a form s registration statement filed with the commission first cause

keep books records and accounts that provided reasonable assurances that transactions it had entered into with its distributors and resellers had been accounted for and not falsified clearone did not devise or maintain a system of internal accounting controls that assured that sales were being properly recorded on its financial statements  as a result of the conduct set forth in paragraphs
