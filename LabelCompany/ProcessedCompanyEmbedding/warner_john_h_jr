became a cause célèbre of prodétente doves in sovietamerican relations he was subsequently appointed by gerald ford to the post of director of the american revolution bicentennial administration following fords defeat warner began to consider political office for himself he entered politics in the  virginia election for us senate despite the publicity of being elizabeth taylors husband and the large amounts of money warner used in his campaign for the nomination he finished second at the state republican party gop convention to the far more conservative politician richard d obenshain much of this loss was due to his perceived liberal political stances especially his soft approach to soviet relations in contrast obenshain was a noted antisoviet a hardline anticommunist and an opponent of other liberal policies including the great society and much of the civil rights movement however fate intervened when obenshain died two months later in a plane crash consequently warner was chosen to replace him and narrowly won the general election over democrat andrew p miller former attorney general of virginia he was in the senate until january   despite his less conservative

was among the minority of his party to vote to expand hate crime laws to include sexual orientation as a protected category he supports a constitutional amendment banning samesex marriage but he raised concerns about the most recent federal marriage amendment as being too restrictive as it would have potentially banned civil unions as well in  warner was one of the few republicans who voted

the large amounts of money warner used in his campaign for the nomination he finished second at the state republican party gop convention to the far more conservative politician richard d obenshain

opponent of other liberal policies including the great society and much of the civil rights movement however fate intervened when obenshain died two months later in a plane crash consequently warner
