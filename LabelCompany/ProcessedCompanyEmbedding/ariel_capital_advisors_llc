in the lanham act nor a historical relic trademark law requires firms to “use marks to obtain rights in them” case cv document   filed  page  of  pageid  accordingly the crux is whether plaintiff used the ariel mark in commerce for “managing investments and investment funds” before it filed its application if not it is void  no facts dispute that use in commerce was after filing the application plaintiff does not dispute that the ariel registration is for the “management of investments an d investment funds” sof  or that it listed its earliest date “when its product or service was first made available to consumers” as september   sof  its supplemented answer was the same  sof  but that use is months after its june   application sof  plaintiff argues that aca mischaracterized its answer and that it was only responding about its first fund  dkt  at   but the interrogatory was not limited to only funds identify each product andor service that you have provided or presently provide or offer for sale for use by consumers and for each describe the product or service in detail and state when the product or service was first made available to consumers sof  emphasis added plaintiff repeated september   in two more interrogatory responses sof     plaintiff also admits that its first “publicfacing separate account” was on september   sof  plaintiff’s b witness also did not know of any account or use earlier than september   id plaintiff’s website further confirms that its earliest product was released september    sof  listing ariel small cap as the earliest product plaintiff also does not dispute that it produced all documents “relating to…selection adoption or first use of the word ‘ariel’ in plaintiff’s name” sof  emphasis added it further does not dispute that it agreed to produce all “documents related to the ‘ariel’ mark’s first use in interstate commerce” id yet it failed to produce any documents showing use in commerce prior to the application filing frcp

portion of a claim from their complaint after it had already “disavowed ” t h a t portion to the court j kennelly but even if the other seven registered marks remained in this suit aca should prevail

recognition indeed plaintiff’s own are not recognized sof   these consumers exercise great care are unlikely to be confused plaintiff concedes investment decisions require great care  and that its buyers are sophisticated dkt  at  sof  rust  fd at  “where consumers are sophisticated deliberative buyers confusion is less likely” plaintiff argues these sophisticated consumers might be confused because the parties’ services and potential clients allegedly overlap dkt  at  but plaintiff admitted otherwise it does not offer aca’s services no overlapping advertising and that aca’s clients are families while its clients are mainly brokers and corporations sof      and unlike in cae inc v clean air engg  fd case cv document   filed  page  of  pageid   th cir  upon which it relies plaintiff and aca do not share clients or advertise in the same journals id at  because the parties admit that they do not target the “same general audience” and have sophisticated buyers confusion is unlikely  plaintiff’s products and aca’s services are different and do not target the same markets or customers when two services do not compete likelihood of confusion decreases knaack v rally  f supp at  “if firms do not compete directly it is harder to show consumers are likely to be confused by similar terms” see also omicron capital llc v omicron capital llc  f supp d    sdny  finding confusion

that provided advice and money management services were not in competition because the services provid ed were significantly different here plaintiff sells mutual funds and separate accounts modified mutual funds while aca does not offer any mutual funds or separate accounts sof   and it is also uncontested that aca provides personalized financial plans estate and retirement planning and prepares tax returns while plaintiff does not provide written financial plans estate plans or prepare tax returns sof    plaintiff argues however that aca’s adv form also lists mutual funds but that form only lists mutual funds in case a client transfers from a different advisor sof  as such the parties serve significantly different purposes coupled with the buyers’ sophistication confusion is unlikely plaintiff’s and aca’s services are also sold to different markets and asset classes indeed differences in the types of customers and transaction sizes are strong evidence of difference in the parties’ respective markets see beneficial corp v beneficial capital corp  f supp   sdny  company with  loans for individual consumers served an entirely case cv document   filed  page  of  pageid   plaintiff

care in selecting a service” case cv document   filed  page  of  pageid  presented by future expansion would be unacceptably conjectural” thus plaintiff’s argument on this point is mere conjecture and must be ignored because aca’s personalized intimate services differ vastly from plaintiff’s mutual funds and because aca serves different markets and classes of consumers this factor favors aca  “ariel” is not wellknown thus it is not the salient portion of plaintiff’s mark so they must be considered as a whole plaintiff’s contention that “ariel” is the salient feature of its mark is unsupported as plaintiff presented no evidence its mark is well known see lincoln fin  wl   holding “sage” was not the salient portion of “sagemark consulting” and “sagepoint financial” because plaintiff did not show its “sage” mark was wellknown indeed sof  cf ty inc v jones grp   fd  th cir  “beanie” was deemed the salient portion because “beanie” is a wellknown and famous part of the ty mark “ariel” thus is not entitled more weight than its surrounding elements so plaintiff’s mark should be considered as a whole here the “ariel investments” and “ariel capital advisors” marks use different fonts serif v sansserif capitalizations layouts coloring design elements and logos turtle v lion sof  lincoln fin  wl  at  customers quickly distinguish logos based on differences in color layout design font and capitalization elements even the case plaintiff cites am eagle outfitters inc v am eagle furniture inc   wl  nd ill dec   supports that marks are viewed as a whole the court there looked at the similariti es of fonts capitalization and their presentations id plaintiff also argues aca’s lion does not distingu ish its marks from plaintiff’s but this again ignores that consumers encounter the marks wholly and that the impression of a lion is substantially different from plaintiff’s turtle sof  see barbecue marx  fd at  because the “smoke daddy” and “bone case cv

meaning of the word namely lion of god bray initially wanted to use the name ariel wealth advisors he performed a google search for this name however and discovered that it was already in use by a

accept clients with smaller portfolios ariel capital does not invest in mutual funds and focuses only on individual as opposed to institutional clients iii the trademark dispute ariel investments claims that ariel capitals use of the word ariel in connection with its financial services infringes the ariel marks specifically ariel investments asserts that given the overlap in services offered by the two companies an individual investor might conclude that ariel capital is sponsored by or otherwise affiliated with ariel investments ariel investments contends that there have been a number of instances where individuals have confused or mistakenly associated the two companies in march  an unidentified caller contacted phyllis brady a human relations representative for ariel investments and attempted to check references for a job candidate the caller was considering the caller allegedly stated that someone at ariel capital had told her that ariel investments and ariel capital were related companies that same month mareilé cusack ariel investments general counsel received a phone call from a woman asking about a piece of real estate in naples florida specifically the woman stated that the real estate was listed under the name ariel she performed a google search to determine whom this referred to and she came up with ariel investments contact information cusack told the woman that ariel investments did not own or lease any property in naples in april  chris squittieri an employee at ariel capital attended a meeting of chartered financial analysts cfas in naples while there squittieri was approached by justin land another cfa who asked squittieri whether there was any affiliation between ariel capital and ariel investments in february  an unidentified caller contacted marcie rebardo an employee at ariel capital asking to speak with cheryl hagen and asking isnt this ariel investments the phone number was later connected to the cell phone of daniel boone the owner of a digital publication on the financial industry boone has since indicated that he was attempting to contact cheryl cargie an employee of ariel investments to discuss an upcoming article and to determine whether ariel investments wanted to advertise in his publication boone stated that he mistakenly found ariel capitals number after performing a google search for ariel investments in may  monica schandel a client of ariel capital also allegedly confused the two firms schandel owns blue oceans financial planning llc and employs ariel capital to provide investment management services counsel for ariel investments contacted schandel to subpoena company records regarding its relationship with ariel capital schandel wrote a letter in response to the request in which she stated that she has one joint client with ariel investments ariel investments says that schandel has a joint client not with ariel investments but with ariel capital further during her deposition in june  schandel appeared to confuse the two companies when asked the location of ariel investments headquarters and whether she knew any of its employees schandel responded with naples florida and by naming bray and squittieri two employees of ariel capital later during her deposition schandel testified that she was a little confused about the names but that ariel capital was the company with which she has a relationship ariel investments filed this suit against ariel capital in april  ariel investments alleges in count  that ariel capitals name constitutes deliberate infringement of the

and punitive damages transfer of the wwwarielcapitaladvisorscom domain name and attorneys fees and costs in its answer ariel capital asserts both affirmative defenses and counterclaims ariel capital first argues in defense to a claim of trademark infringement that the registration for the ariel mark must be cancelled because it was procured by ariel investments fraud on the uspto in its second affirmative defense ariel capital alleges that ariel investments has abandoned the ariel and ariel investments marks due to naked licensing and a failure to police the marks ariel capital also has asserted a fivecount counterclaim two counts of which this court dismissed in a prior order see ariel invs llc v ariel capital advisors llc no  c   wl  nd ill may   in the remaining counts of its counterclaim ariel capital asserts that  the word ariel is merely a descriptive term that cannot be trademarked under section e of the lanham act  the word ariel is a generic term that cannot be trademarked under  usc §  and  ariel investments has abandoned the ariel mark and therefore its registration must be cancelled ariel capital requests declaratory and injunctive relief discussion ariel investments has moved for partial summary judgment it contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on counts  and  of its complaint because its trademarks are incontestable and otherwise valid and it has demonstrated a likelihood of confusion between the ariel marks and ariel capitals name ariel capital has crossmoved for summary judgment ariel capital argues first that ariel investments has essentially waived its right to bring claims based on seven of the nine ariel marks leaving only the claims based on the ariel mark and the ariel investments mark ariel capital then argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on counts  and  for two reasons the ariel marks registration must be cancelled due to fraud by ariel investments and there is no likelihood of confusion between the ariel investments mark and ariel capitals name ariel capital further argues that because claims under illinois law rely on the same standard as the lanham act the court should grant summary judgment in favor of ariel capital on counts  and  finally ariel capital argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on count  because ariel investments cannot establish the elements of cybersquatting summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence provided shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law sorensen v wd co  fd   th cir  facts

defs mem in supp of mot for summ j at  in making this argument ariel capital points to two statements by ariel investments in response to a discovery request ariel investments stated ariel capital insists on discovery relating to ariel investments use of animal illustrations not at issue in this case only the ariel and ariel investments marks are at issue in this case pls resp to defs mot to compel produc of docs at  this statement however was made in response to ariel capitals request for discovery of animal imagery ariel investments was only indicating that the images themselves are not at issue ariel investments was not attempting to limit the scope of its claims ariel capital also points to ariel investments motion to dismiss ariel capitals counterclaims in the background section of that brief ariel investments referred only to the ariel and ariel investments marks indicating that those two marks have become incontestable under the lanham act pls mem in supp of mot to dismiss defs countercls at  but ariel investments did not thereby disclaim its allegations based on the other seven marks the fact that ariel investments at times chose to refer to one or two marks does not amount to a relinquishment of claims brought based on the other marks ariel capital relies on green v travis no  c   wl  nd ill sept   a case in which this court found that plaintiffs were estopped from bringing a claim of fiduciary duty id at  in green however the court noted that plaintiffs had said they were making no such claim and disavowed any intention to raise such a claim in the future id that is not the case here in sum the court overrules ariel capitals contention that ariel investments claims are limited to only the ariel and ariel investments marks ii counts  and  in count  ariel investments alleges that ariel capital has infringed all nine of the ariel marks in violation of section  of the lanham act in count  ariel investments alleges that ariel capital has engaged in

validity and the registrants exclusive right to use it in commerce  usc § b the same statute however permits certain defenses to an incontestable mark including that the registration or the

deliberate attempt to mislead ariel capital points to deposition testimony from rogers who stated that ariel investments publicfacing investment accounts began in september  defs stat of material facts ex  at  ariel capital argues that ariel investments did not use the mark in commerce until this date and because ariel investments was a closelyrun company rogers must have known this when the company applied to the uspto to register the ariel mark in june  as a result ariel capital contends the registration was obtained fraudulently the court rejects ariel capitals contention that the relevant date of first use in commerce is the date when ariel investments offered its first investment fund to the public in september  use in commerce is defined in the lanham act as follows the term use in commerce means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark for purposes of this chapter a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce—  on goods when— a it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable then on documents associated with the goods or their sale and b the goods are sold or transported in commerce and  on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce or the services are rendered in more than one state or in the united states and a foreign country and the person rendering the services is engaged in commerce in connection with the services  usc §  nothing about this definition required ariel investments to offer an investment fund to the public in order to be considered to have used the term ariel in commerce ariel capitals contention that the relevant date is when ariel investments offered its first fund to the public is the only affirmative evidence it offers regarding the falsity of the registration application the remainder of ariel capitals argument on the fraudulent application issue consists of attacks on the sufficiency of the contrary evidence that ariel investments has offered but because the issue of fraud is a point on which ariel capital bears the burden of proof it is not enough for it to argue that ariel investments contrary evidence is not to be believed when a party bears the burden of proof on a point it cannot satisfy that burden by arguing that the opposing partys evidence is inadequate to establish the contrary proposition see anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    see generally a miller b federal practice and procedure §  supp  and even were this not the case the evidence offered by ariel investments though it is arguably less than conclusive is sufficient to preclude any reasonable jury from finding that there was any deliberate intent to mislead the uspto on the first use in commerce point ariel investments was offering services so the question under section  quoted earlier is whether it had used or displayed the term ariel in selling or advertising investment management services and the services were rendered in commerce it has offered as evidence a newsletter and informational brochures dated prior to the trademark registration application that use the name ariel capital management inc in addition merrillyn kosier ariel investments chief marketing officer testified that rogers founded the company in january  with a number of clients for whom he was investing money pls stat of addl facts ex rr kosier dep at  this evidence though it is less than crystal clear is sufficient to prevent any reasonable jury from finding by clear and convincing evidence that ariel investments deliberately attempted to mislead the uspto in claiming a firstuseincommerce date predating the application the court concludes that ariel capital has not offered evidence sufficient to support a defense to the incontestability of the registered mark  unregistered marks even if none of the ariel marks were registered with the uspto they might still receive protection under section  of the lanham act two pesos inc v taco cabana inc  us    indicating that section  only protects registered marks whereas section  can protect both registered and unregistered marks a trademark can be enforced under section  regardless of whether the mark has been registered see specialized seating inc v greenwich indus lp  fd   th cir  the purpose of section  is to prevent unfair competition that leads to mistaking a junior users product as originating from a senior user see fortres grand corp v warner bros entmt inc  fd   th cir  defining a senior user as the first and protected user of the mark this distinction is irrelevant for eight of the nine marks for which ariel capital has not raised a challenge to the registrations but had ariel capital offered evidence sufficient to permit a finding that ariel investments committed fraud in registering the ariel mark—requiring cancellation of the registration and thereby defeating the section  claim based on this mark—it might try to defeat the section  claim brought in count  with regard to that particular mark based on the argument that ariel investments was not in fact the senior user of the mark having concluded that there is no genuine factual dispute on the fraudulent registration issue the court mentions this point only for the sake of completeness of the record ariel capital argued in its reply brief that ariel investments failed to produce any evidence that it used its ariel common law mark in the naples or cleveland areas prior to ariel capital defs reply at  because ariel capital first raised this point in its reply brief ariel investments had no fair opportunity to respond though ariel capital made a brief mention of the point in its opening motion see defs mem in supp of mot for summ j at  it was only a passing reference that was insufficient to put ariel investments on notice that it was seeking entry of judgment on this basis  counterclaims ariel capitals counterclaim includes three claims that challenge whether the ariel marks are protectable or incontestable it contends that one or more of the marks are merely descriptive are generic or have been abandoned neither party has moved for summary judgment on any of these claims nor has either party made arguments regarding the case law relevant to the claims the court therefore does not address their merits at this time b likelihood of confusion ariel capital argues that there is no likelihood of confusion as between its name and the ariel investments mark it makes no argument along these lines regarding the other marks that are at issue ariel investments argues that there is a likelihood of confusion as between ariel capitals name and all of the ariel marks courts consider seven factors in determining whether consumers are likely to be confused by a defendants use of certain marks  the similarity between the marks  the similarity of the products  the area and manner of concurrent use  the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers  the strength of the plaintiffs mark  any evidence of actual confusion and  the intent of the defendant sorensen  fd at  no single factor is dispositive but three are particularly important the similarity of the marks the intent of the defendant and evidence of actual confusion id  similarity between the marks in assessing the similarity of the marks the test is not whether the public would confuse the marks but whether the viewer of an accused mark would be likely to associate the product or service with which it is connected with the source of products or services with which an earlier mark is connected id the marks are sufficiently similar that a consumer might reasonably believe that ariel capital and its services are associated with ariel investments both use the word ariel as an identifier in combination with more general financial terms such as investments and capital advisors further ariel investments has trademarked various terms relating to financial services all of which begin with the word ariel ariel investments has therefore provided sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the marks are similar ariel capital argues that the two companies logos are markedly different defeating a conclusion that the marks are similar in particular ariel capital points to the fact that logos use different fonts different colors and different animals to promote the two companies but the seventh circuit has indicated that if one word or feature of a trademark is deemed to be the salient portion of the mark it may be given greater weight than surrounding elements sullivan v cbs corp  fd   th cir  in this type of situation it is inappropriate to focus on minor stylistic differences to determine if confusion is likely id ariel investments trademarked ariel as well as eight other marks beginning with the word ariel not a particular logo containing the image of a turtle the term ariel is the salient portion of all of the ariel marks and thus entitled to greater weight when determining similarity because ariel capital has used the term ariel in much the same way ariel investments uses it throughout the ariel marks this first factor weighs in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion  similarity of products the next factor is the similarity of the products or services offered by the plaintiff and the defendant similarity does not require the products or services to be identical see cae  fd at  trademark rights extend to any goods that might be in the minds of consumers related and therefore the appropriate inquiry is whether the public is likely to attribute the products and services to a single source id closely related products are those that consumers would reasonably expect to be affiliated with or sponsored by the trademark owner id both ariel investments and ariel capital offer services related to wealth management and financial planning although ariel capital focuses on personalized services such as tax and estate planning whereas ariel investments focuses on mutual funds a consumer might reasonably believe that one company offered all of these services or that a single company sponsors or endorses both ventures ariel capital argues that there is little similarity because it offers services— personalized financial planning—whereas ariel investments offers products—offtherack mutual funds defs resp at  this distinction however is insufficient to prevent a finding of similarity because one company might offer or sponsor both products and services particularly when the products and services fall within the same industry further courts have recognized that trademark law is also meant to protect the ability of a trademark owner to enter product markets in which it does not now trade but into which it might reasonably be expected to expand in the future cae  fd at  a reasonable factfinder could find a reasonable likelihood that ariel investments would wish to expand into personalized financial services in the future  area and manner of concurrent use the next factor is concurrent use which involves an assessment of whether there is a relationship in use promotion distribution or sales between the goods or services of the parties id although ariel capital only has offices in florida and ohio ariel investments is a national firm and therefore advertises to potential clients in florida and ohio further ariel capital has clients in at least ten states indicating that its customer base has significant overlap with that of ariel investments ariel capital argues that the two companies target different audiences and therefore the marks do not have concurrent use specifically it argues that it focuses on wealthy individual clients whereas ariel investments focuses on institutional investors but ariel investments provides services to individual investors as well and the fact that ariel capital may attract clients with a larger portfolio does not mean that the areas and manners of use do not overlap a reasonable factfinder could find that this factor weighs in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion  degree of care the next factor is the degree of care exercised by consumers in considering the degree of care courts assume that the more widely accessible and inexpensive the products and services the more likely that consumers will exercise a lesser degree of care and discrimination in their purchases sorensen  fd at  as ariel capital argues consumers likely exercise a high degree of care when making large financial decisions or when deciding where to invest their money further ariel investments customers are typically large institutions which are more likely to be sophisticated consumers but customers technical sophistication about their particular industry does not equate to trademark sophistication cae  fd at  the fact that consumers are especially careful in selecting a financial services provider does not mean that they would not be confused as to the affiliation between two financial companies whose names contain the word ariel as discussed below there is evidence that some persons with knowledge of the financial industry were confused as to the relationship between the two companies a reasonable factfinder could find this factor tilts somewhat in ariel capitals favor but would not be required to do so  strength of mark the next factor is the strength of the mark the strength of a trademark refers to the marks distinctiveness meaning its propensity to identify the products or services sold as emanating from a particular source sorensen  fd at  ariel investments argues that the ariel marks are strong because ariel investments has been using them for thirty years it spends a substantial amount of money on advertising each year its officers contribute to magazines and television programs thereby increasing brand awareness and it has earned many industry awards ariel investments does not offer however any consumer surveys or testimony reflecting public recognition of the ariel marks ariel capital argues that the ariel marks are weak because over  companies have the word ariel in their name other such companies have existed in the financial sector without confusion and consumers associate ariel investments with its turtle image and slow and steady motto and not with the ariel marks defs resp at  but the fact that the term ariel may be used in connection with other businesses and products is irrelevant as uses of the name outside the financial services field could not possibly cause confusion with ariel investments marks tisch hotels inc v am inn inc  fd   th cir  the question of whether other financial services firms such as ariel wealth advisors are also infringing on the ariel marks is equally irrelevant see id a reasonable factfinder could find this to be a neutral factor or as tilting slightly in either sides favor  actual confusion the sixth factor evidence of actual confusion weighs slightly in favor of ariel investments courts considering this factor must look to whether reasonable and prudent consumers would identify the infringing mark as coming from a company affiliated with ariel investments platinum home mortg corp v platinum fin grp inc  fd   th cir  evidence of actual confusion is not required to prove that a likelihood of confusion exists but when available it is entitled to substantial weight cae  fd at  ariel investments offers five instances of alleged actual confusion ariel capital raises evidentiary objections against each of them and also argues that they are insufficient to show actual confusion ariel investments first points to a telephone call made to phyllis brady a human resources representative for ariel investments the unidentified caller was attempting to check a job reference and stated that someone at ariel capital had told her that ariel investments and ariel capital were related companies pls stat of material facts ex cc pls ans to defs interrogs ariel investments also points to a phone call to mareilé cusack ariel investments general counsel a female caller asked cusack whether ariel investments was associated with a specific parcel of real estate located in florida and listed under the name ariel pls stat of material facts ex d cusack decl the caller allegedly indicated that she performed a google search for ariel and found ariel investments contact information ariel capital argues that evidence of both of these calls is inadmissible hearsay the court disagrees ariel investments is offering these statements not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather to prove the state of mind of the callers ie that both were confused as to the relationship between ariel capital and ariel investments thus the statement is not hearsay at all or is at least admissible under the state of mind exception in federal rule of evidence  see eg piper aircraft corp v wagaero inc  fd   th cir  fed r evid  ariel investments next points to deposition testimony by bray in which he relayed a statement by another employee squittieri squittieri told bray that justin land another cfa approached squittieri at a cfa meeting and asked him whether there was any affiliation between ariel capital and ariel investments pls stat of material facts ex q at  ariel capital again argues that this testimony is hearsay and thus must be excluded again the court disagrees under federal rule of evidence  each statement embedded in this evidence must be admissible either as nonhearsay or under an exception to the hearsay rule this requirement is met here brays deposition testimony and the statement by squittieri that bray related are not hearsay they are offered by ariel investments as statements by an agent of an opposing party and are admissible under federal rule of evidence dd and as discussed earlier lands statement to squittieri is admissible to show lands state of mind ariel investments also points to an incident in february  marcie rebardo an employee at ariel capital received a phone call from an unidentified caller asking to speak with cheryl hagen the caller also asked isnt this ariel investments the phone number was later connected to daniel boone the owner of a digital publication during his deposition boone testified that he was attempting to call cheryl cargie of ariel investments in order to discuss advertising in his publication pls stat of material facts ex z at  ariel capital argues that boones testimony is inadmissible because it is unreliable pointing to his testimony that he does not remember the call per se because he makes numerous calls see id at  but boone is able to recall significant details including the purpose for the call making his testimony sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence ariel capitals argument therefore goes to the testimonys weight and not its admissibility see united states v irby  fd   th cir  finally ariel investments points to statements by schandel a client of ariel capital in a may  letter to counsel for ariel investments schandel referred to ariel investments when she meant to refer to ariel capital pls stat of material facts ex bb schandel email further during schandels deposition she repeatedly answered questions about ariel investments with information about ariel capital pls stat of material facts ex aa schandel dep at   ariel capital argues that this information is irrelevant because schandel merely misspoke and was not confused between the two companies again this affects only the evidences weight not its admissibility ariel capital next argues that none of these instances of alleged confusion is relevant or material because they did not involve confusion by an actual consumer of either ariel capitals or ariel investments services defs resp at  the seventh circuit has previously suggested that persons who are not attempting to purchase goods or services from either party are not relevant consumers when considering the likelihood of confusion under the lanham act see packman v chicago tribune co  fd   th cir  and it is true that schandel is the only person in the cited examples who was an actual client of either party the seventh circuit has also indicated however that misattribution in media articles can be indicative of confusion see piper aircraft corp  fd at  making boones testimony relevant as evidence of actual confusion further both ariel capital and ariel investments have indicated that they often gain clients through referrals therefore confusion by others in the industry such as cfa justin land is relevant in considering whether referrals might be misdirected between the two companies finally both ariel investments and ariel capital use their websites to spread awareness of their products and services ariel investments even permits clients to sign up through its website therefore any confusion as between the two companies that results from a google search may have an impact on consumers thus this factor weighs in favor of ariel investments but it is not conclusive on the issue of likelihood of confusion its weight is fairly debatable  intent in assessing the factor of intent courts look at whether the defendant is attempting to pass off its product as having come from the plaintiff sorensen  fd at  and generally it is the second users responsibility to avoid confusion in its choice of a trademark a responsibility that includes choosing a mark whose salient portion would not likely be confused with a first users mark forum corp of n am v forum ltd  fd   th cir  discussing similarity of the marks ariel investments points to evidence indicating that bray knew of ariel investments founder rogers before bray founded his company he regularly read a magazine in which ariel investments advertised and he had received promotional emails from ariel investments before founding ariel capital pls mem in supp of mot for summ j at  a reasonable factfinder could conclude from the evidence that bray realized or deliberately ignored that he was adopting a name that was confusingly similar to ariel investments mark but knowledge of a competitor or its mark does not always demonstrate the requisite intent packman  fd at  citing ziebart intl corp v after market assoc  fd   th cir  in addition bray has provided a plausible explanation for his use of the term ariel that a jury reasonably could accept he says he chose the term to reference his daughter and the ministry at which he and his wife serve in sum a reasonable factfinder could find the intent factor to be neutral or to favor ariel capital or to favor ariel investments though perhaps not all that strongly  conclusion this is not a case in which likelihood of confusion can be determined in either partys favor on summary judgment some of the factors arguably favor ariel investments some arguably favor ariel capital and several could be assessed either way or as neutral the court concludes that a reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion but would not be required to do so the court therefore denies both sides motions for summary judgment on counts  and  iii counts  and  where a plaintiffs factual allegations under the idtpa also form the basis for plaintiffs claim under the lanham act the legal inquiry is the same under both statutes sb designs v reebok intl ltd  fsuppd   nd ill  claims for unfair competition and

of the domain name wwwarielcapitaladvisorscom constitutes cybersquatting in violation of  usc § da ariel capital argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because no reasonable juror could find that ariel capital had the requisite intent under the lanham act an individual shall be liable to the owner of a mark if he or she has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark    and registers traffics in or uses a domain name that    is identical or confusingly similar to that mark  usc § daiii cybersquatting typically occurs when a person registers a domain name of a wellknown trademark and then attempts to profit from this either by ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or by using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder daimlerchrysler v the net inc  fd   th cir  ariel investments cites its evidence that bray was aware of ariel investments and its marks when he established ariel capital see pls combined reply and oppn at  n but in the courts view this falls short of evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer a bad faith intent to profit from ariel investments marks ariel capital is entitled to summary judgment on count  conclusion for the foregoing reasons the court denies plaintiff ariel investments motion for summary judgment on counts  and  dkt no  the court grants defendant ariel capitals motion for summary judgment on count  but denies the motion on counts    and  dkt no  footnotes  the court also rejects ariel capitals contention that the registration can be invalidated simply by a showing of the absence of use of the mark in commerce before the registration date even if the registration was not obtained fraudulently the statute makes it clear that once a mark is
