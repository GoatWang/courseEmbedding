summaryrealized a negative economic return on our common stock of  for the year after accounting for dividends of  on a pro forma basis after adjusting our net book value per common share at september   for the cash and stock portions of the deficiency dividend paid in december  the remaining change in net book value per share during the fourth quarter was  per share on a basic and diluted basiscontinued the reduction of nonagency rmbs exposure from  million at december   to  million at december   on a nongaap combined basis since year end we have sold  million of the remaining exposure substantially completing our reduction in nonagency rmbs exposurecontinued to redeploy capital released from selling down our credit exposure into agency rmbs which increased from  million at december   to  million at december    in order to minimize the potential impact of interest rate volatility the increase was composed of purchases of agency hybridarmscommencing on august   we ceased to aggregate prime jumbo mortgage loans and no longer maintain warehousing facilities to fund loan purchases  the reduction in personnel and related business infrastructure expenses of the prime jumbo business will be substantially complete by march  on april   we effected a resecuritization of certain first loss multifamily mbs securities backed by freddie mac k certificates with a certificate principal balance of approximately  million permitting the repayment of all related repurchase agreement financing  additionally on april   we sold first loss securities from another freddie mac k series transaction with a certificate balance of approximately  million plus related interestonly securities permitting the repayment of all related repurchase agreement financingon november   we declared a deficiency dividend of  or  per common share which was paid by the issuance of  common shares at a price of  per share and the remainder of  in cash  the deficiency dividend was paid in order to reduce our undistributed taxable income from  and in accordance with reit rules and regulations in connection with a determination of an inability to offset net gains realized on certain hedging transactions in  against net capital losses realized on the sale of mortgagebacked securities  we recorded a charge of  million in the third quarter for interest charges projected to be payable to the irs in the first quarter of  on march   we paid an amount of  million to the irs and accordingly will record an additional interest charge of  million in the first quarter core earnings is a nongaap measure that we define as gaap net income excluding impairment losses realized and unrealized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio and certain nonrecurring upfront costs related to securitization transactions or other onetime charges as defined core earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments economic return is a nongaap measure that we define as the sum of the change in net book value per common share and dividends declared on our common stock during the period over the beginning net book value per common sharemanagement observationsdavid carroll five oaks chairman and ceo commented the latter part of  was certainly interesting and eventful for both the markets and for five oaks the unanticipated election of donald trump was viewed positively for both equity and credit markets and reflationary for fixed income markets the year treasury rose from a low of  to a high of  representing a  bps low to high range the s spread widened from  bps to as high as  bps typically such conditions are negative for levered buyers of fixed rate mortgages and hence mortgage reit book values while curve steepening is positive for reinvestment opportunities we believe the fed will tighten a few times this year which is now reflected in the steepening curve and higher rates across the curve we also believe the longer term direction of rates is highly dependent on the new administrations success in implementing its reflationary growth plans for the economy given the political gridlock we have seen over the last several years we would not be surprised to see implementation of the new administrations economic and fiscal plan take longer than the markets appear to be pricing inafter adjusting for the stock and cash components of our december  deficiency dividend our net book value per share was down approximately  from  to  in the fourth quarter i believe that our performance in the quarter was solid given market volatility due in significant part to our methodical and active hedging focus upon intermediate floatingrate agency hybrid securities and a tightening in credit spreads agency spreads tightened as rates increased and the curve steepened in the hybrid agency sector while the year agency sector widened and extended into the selloff we continued to opportunistically sell down our legacy nonagency positions which we exited completely in the first quarter of  and also made opportunistic sales of our multifamily and new issue nonagency subordinate positions in order to further reduce our reliance on repo funding of credit risk assets we reinvested proceeds into new issue agency hybrids at yields and spreads we consider attractive as rates increased read moreas communicated previously we intend to continue to focus on a business strategy that is both simpler to understand and more cost efficient we now intend to focus our balance sheet assets primarily on intermediate agency hybrid floating rate securities and freddie mac kseries multifamily exposure while looking also for term funded credit opportunities when they arise investing in agency hybrid securities should allow us to capture yield while seeking to minimize extension risk hybrid securities also typically benefit from roll down the curve which is amplified as the yield curve steepens  as it did particularly in the fourth quarter our simplified business strategy and exiting the prime jumbo aggregation business has allowed us to meaningfully bring down our expense base a process we believe will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter we also booked our first meaningful volume of business as backstop guarantee provider for what we believe to be limited rep and warranty risk on prime jumbo residential mortgage loans sold through maxexs lnex exchangelooking back on our full year  i believe we have made great strides in simplifying our business model improving
