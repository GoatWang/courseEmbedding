housing limited partnership  a washington limited partnership raymond james native american housing opportunities fund ii llc a delaware limited liability company mike avila and patti gobin husband and wife and the marital community comprised thereof chuck james and jane doe james husband and wife and the marital community comprised thereof  defendant     i introduction this matter comes before the court upon plaintiff’s motion to remand to state court and for an award of fees and costs dkt   for the reasons set forth below plaintiff’s motion is granted  order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand   docketsjustiacom  ii discussion  a background  plaintiff brought this action in snohomish county superior court on july    naming defendants mike alva patti gobin chuck james and jane doe james the “individual  defendants” raymond james native american housing opportunities fund ii llc the  “fund” and tulalip housing limited partnership  the “partnership” plaintiff is a citizen of  the state of washington the individual defendants are enrolled members of the tulalip tribes  who live on the tulalip reservation and are also washington residents the partnership is a  washington limited partnership with its principal place of business in washington the fund is  a delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place of business in florida  on august   the state court granted a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter  jurisdiction filed on behalf of the individual defendants and the partnership the nondiverse  defendants provided three bases for the motion first they claimed that the tribal court had  exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims second they argued that individual defendants  had sovereign immunity as plaintiff’s claims arose out of the performance of their official duties  and in any event the state had not assumed jurisdiction over claims against tribal members  occurring on tribal lands finally the defendants contended that tulalip tribes was an  indispensable party that could not be joined because of sovereign immunity the state court  granted the motion without indicating the grounds upon which the dismissal was based  on september   the fund removed the action to this court asserting removal  jurisdiction predicated on the complete diversity between the parties and an amount in    if the state court indicated the grounds for dismissal in its oral comments neither party has so  notified this court order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand    controversy exceeding  see  usc §§    the removal was filed within  thirty days of august   the date upon which the state court issued its oral ruling  dismissing the nondiverse defendants from the lawsuit see  usc b also pending  before the court is the fund’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant  to fed r civ p b see dkt    in its motion to remand plaintiff argues that removal is improper under the  voluntaryinvoluntary rule because plaintiff did not engage in any voluntary act that rendered the  case removable see people of state of cal by and through lungren v keating  fd    th cir  rather the nondiverse defendants were dismissed over plaintiff’s  objection when the state court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject  matter jurisdiction in retort defendant argues that a dismissal based on lack of subject matter  jurisdiction is not subject to the voluntaryinvoluntary doctrine or in the alternative that the non diverse defendants were fraudulently joined to defeat federal jurisdiction  b analysis    standard “any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states  have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district  court of the united states for the district … where such action is pending”  usc §  a caterpillar inc v williams  us    the court may remand a case  to state court on motion by either party and at any time before final judgment when the court  finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims  usc § c the “burden of  establishing federal jurisdiction is on the party seeking removal and the removal statute is  strictly construed against removal jurisdiction” prize frize inc v matrix inc  fd    th cir  superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in abrego abrego v dow order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand    chem co  fd   th cir  any doubt as to the right of removal is resolved in  favor of remand gaus v miles inc  fd   th cir   removal based on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction requires establishing the parties’  diverse citizenship and an amount in controversy exceeding   usc §  sanchez  v monumental life ins co  fd   th cir  in addition under the  voluntaryinvoluntary rule if a suit could not be filed in federal court at the time of its filing  then it “must ‘remain in state court unless a “voluntary” act of the plaintiff brings about a  change that renders the case removable’ ” keating  fd at  quoting self v general  motors corp  fd   th cir  emphasis added an exception to the  voluntaryinvoluntary rule exists where nondiverse defendants have been fraudulently joined for  the purpose of defeating diversity jurisdiction self  fd at  “fraudulent joinder is a  term of art if the plaintiff fails to state a cause of action against a resident defendant and the  failure is obvious according to the settled rules of the state the joinder of the resident defendant  is fraudulent” mccabe v general foods corp  fd   th cir  see also  ritchey v upjohn drug co  fd  th cir     voluntaryinvoluntary rule here the court agrees with plaintiff that the voluntaryinvoluntary rule applies to prevent  removal of this action plaintiff’s case could not have been brought in federal court because  diversity jurisdiction did not exist further the parties concede that plaintiff did not seek to  dismiss the resident defendants in the action below and that the dismissal was effected over  plaintiff’s objection see dkt   ex  accordingly the plaintiff did not engage in any  voluntary act that would render the case removable   order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand      insinga exception to voluntaryinvoluntary rule the fund argues that the fact that the resident defendants were dismissed for lack of  subject matter jurisdiction renders the voluntaryinvoluntary rule inapplicable the court  disagrees in insinga v labella the eleventh circuit held that the voluntaryinvoluntary rule did  not apply where the nondiverse defendant was dismissed in state court for jurisdictional reasons  rather than on the merits  fd   the eleventh circuit’s analysis was based on  language from whitcomb v smithson which is widely cited as the case that first announced the  voluntaryinvoluntary rule  us   there the supreme court held that a removal  was improper because the plaintiff had not undertaken a voluntary action that rendered the case  removable id in doing so it noted that the dismissal in state court had been “on the merits and  not a ruling on the question of jurisdiction”  us at  based on this language the  insinga court inferred that the inverse was also true that where a dismissal was not on the merits  and was a ruling on the question of jurisdiction the voluntaryinvoluntary rule did not apply  insinga  fd at   the ninth circuit has yet to address whether an exception to the voluntaryinvoluntary  rule ought to exist for jurisdictional dismissals of nondiverse defendants see keating  fd  at  stating simply that “the rule provides that a suit which at the time of filing could not  have been brought in federal court must remain in state court unless a voluntary act of the  plaintiff brings about a change that renders the case removable” however several district  courts outside of the eleventh circuit have affirmatively rejected insinga see arthur v du pont   f supp   n  sd wva  collecting cases in effect the insinga exception  expands the fraudulent joinder exception discussed infra to include not only those instances in  which the plaintiff’s failure to state a claim against the nondiverse defendant was obvious at the  outset of the lawsuit but also those instances in which a jurisdictional defect may have been order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand    latent or hotly contested the court is hesitant to expand the scope of removal jurisdiction to  such a degree where there is no binding precedent supporting such a precedent see gaus v  miles inc  fd   th cir  holding that any doubt as to the right of removal  is resolved in favor of remand see also self  fd at  holding that the policy behind the  voluntaryinvoluntary rule is to allow the plaintiff through the allegations made in his complaint  to determine the removability of his case throughout the litigation” finally to the extent that  insinga is predicated on supreme court doctrine this court is not persuaded that whitcomb  stands for the proposition ascribed to it by the eleventh circuit the question of whether  dismissal of nondiverse defendants could stand as a predicate for removal jurisdiction based on  diversity was not before the court in that matter see whitcomb  us at     fraudulent joinder exception to voluntaryinvoluntary rule the fund argues in the alternative that plaintiff fraudulently joined the individual  defendants and the partnership in the state court action to avoid federal jurisdiction fraudulent  joinder is a wellsettled exception to the voluntaryinvoluntary rule see self  fd at   joinder of nondiverse defendants is fraudulent if the plaintiff fails to state a claim against those  defendants and the failure is obvious under settled state law mccabe  fd at   here the state court dismissed the individual defendants and the partnership for lack of  subject matter jurisdiction finding  that the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction over the  plaintiff’s claims  that the individual defendants enjoyed sovereign immunity andor  that  the tulalip tribes was an indispensable party it was not obvious that the state court would  reach this conclusion the standard for determining whether the tribal court has exclusive  jurisdiction over a particular matter is complex and multifaceted see montana v united states   us   sct   led   holding that a tribe has jurisdiction over non members who enter into a consensual relationship with the tribe or its members and nonorder granting plaintiff’s motion for remand    member conduct that threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity the economic  security or the health and welfare of the tribe based on the tribes inherent power to regulate  such matters see also rodriguez v wong  wn app    holding that a tribal  courts jurisdiction is exclusive if it is necessary to protect tribal selfgovernment or to control  internal relations” similarly dismissal based upon sovereign immunity requires specific  findings regarding whether individual defendants are tribal officials and whether they were  acting as representatives of the tribe during the time period in question see hardin v white  mountain apache tribe  fd   th cir  finally the indispensability of a  defendant involves many factors which “must be carefully analyzed because the question of  whether a party is necessary under cr  calls for determinations that are heavily influenced by  the facts and circumstances of individual cases” burt v wash state dep’t of corrections   wnd    each of these standards is far too complex and factspecific for the  court to determine that plaintiff knew or could have known from the outset that its claims  against the nondiverse defendants would be dismissed the fraudulent joinder exception does  not apply plaintiff’s motion to remand is granted    pending motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction finally the court addresses defendant’s pending motion to dismiss for lack of subject  matter jurisdiction dkt   federal removal jurisdiction is limited to civil actions “brought  in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction”   usc §  the “burden of establishing federal jurisdiction is on the party seeking removal”  prize frize inc  fd at  in this motion the fund argues “this court lacks subject  matter jurisdiction over this matter because the tulalip tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction”  dkt   p  emphasis added the court is concerned that the fund in asserting removal  jurisdiction and opposing plaintiff’s motion to remand claims that this court has original order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand    jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims dkt     yet in the same breath the fund argues that  the action should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction dkt   this  equivocation on the part of the fund provides the court with an independent basis for granting  plaintiff’s motion to remand    motion for fees and costs “an order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses  including attorney fees incurred as a result of the removal”  usc § c the  determination to award costs and fees under § c is within the discretion of the district  court martin  us at   sct  however “absent unusual circumstances courts  may award attorneys fees under § c only where the removing party lacked an objectively  reasonable basis for seeking removal conversely when an objectively reasonable basis exists  fees should be denied” martin v franklin capital corp  us    removal is  not objectively unreasonable simply because the removing partys arguments lack merit and the  removal is ultimately unsuccessful lussier v dollar tree stores inc  fd   th  cir rather the court should assess “whether the relevant case law clearly foreclosed the  defendants basis of removal” by examining the “clarity of the law at the time of removal” id at   see also patel v del taco inc  fd  – th cir suggesting that a  frivolous basis for removal justifies an award of fees  here the fund had no objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal plaintiff did not  voluntarily dismiss the nondiverse defendants and there was no basis to infer that the defendants  had been fraudulently joined in the lawsuit there is no binding precedent upholding an  exception for dismissals based on jurisdiction rather than on the merits finally defendants  have moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction upon remand to state court the  state court shall determine the amount of fees and costs to be imposed order granting plaintiff’s motion for remand      iii conclusion for each of the reasons above and having considered plaintiff’s motion the response and  reply all declarations and attachments thereto and the remainder of the record the court hereby  finds and orders   plaintiff’s motion to remand dkt   is granted   this action is hereby dismissed and remanded to state court all pending motions are    stricken as moot  the clerk of the court is directed to forward a copy of this order to all counsel of record dated this th day of
