buyouts mbos early stage financing owner liquidity initial public offering ipos strategic planning and assessment services additional services online inquiry contact information partnering speeches and seminars employment opportunities deal broker loosens grip on his firm article originally appeared in the wall street journal one of the regions leading deal makers gordon tunstall is finally taking some of his own highpriced advice the anhour consultant to companies seeking private or public capital has traditionally kept a tight grip on the reins of his tampa based firm tunstall consulting inc now for the first time he is planning to share the drivers seat seeking new partners who can help the firm grow he even has his eye on a possible public offering by the year  and as tunstall grows so grows the regions deal roster say investment bankers and analysts the influential mr tunstall plays matchmaker to some of floridas and the southeasts hottest companies and with the added firepower his new partners will bring his firm could be making more deals than ever though the terms of any deal are still to be drafted mr tunstall says he has identified six candidates  two current employees and four outsiders  who will be invited to acquire collectively up to  of his closely held firm over the next two years it isnt clear how much capital if any the new rainmakers would invest but the expansion is about gaining people power not financial muscle mr tunstall says letting go he expects that in return for a stake in tunstall consulting the new principals will help quadruple the firms annual revenue to roughly  million in less than three years mr tunstall declines to discuss whether he will broaden the firms scope as well but people familiar with his plans say he is considering such related areas as securities law this expansion marks a major shift for the handson mr tunstall who until now hasnt been interested in having the firm grow beyond a size he could personally control about four years ago he closed the firms two outposts in atlanta and fort lauderdale partly because it was too much of a hassle until recently he was reluctant even to share tunstall consultings financial results with his own highranking staffers but after some soulsearching the  yearold mr tunstall says he realizes that its time for him to let go ive got to do this he says in an interview from boston im smart enough to know that i may not be around for the next  years to run this firm he acknowledges that while he regularly develops longrange growth plans for his clients he has in some respects neglected his own firm over the past  years as mr tunstall dominated in his role as chief deal maven some key principals have left to work as executives for tunstall consultings clients now he is left with few people around him that he can count on for the future he says to stop this brain drain and to pursue growth he has decided to provide more financial incentive in the form of an equity stake and possibly profitsharing for the principals he now hopes to recruit of course he isnt willing to offer such a carrot to strangers his potential new partners he says are business associates with whom he already has a relationship the only one whom he will identify right now is longtime friend marc bendesky who joined tunstll consulting two years ago as a marketing director from a new york publishing company mr bendesky  says that with an equity stake in the firm he will begin to take a more active role regional gains privately mr tunstalls investment banking pals say they have urged him to expand they say they welcome the prospect of bidding on more deals brokered by his firm which could bring more financing to the region tunstall consulting doesnt reveal most of its client list but mr tunstall says at least half of the  or so transactions he completes annually are generated from companies based in florida and the southeast typically he targets hot young companies he believes are capable of delivering at least  annual sales and profit growth to be sure mr tunstalls instincts dont always produce longterm winners one notable former client burger chain checkers drivein restaurants in clearwater is one of floridas biggest stock bombs of the past decade the stock now at about  peaked at a splitadjusted  five years ago mr tunstall says he cant be held responsible for the burger wars and management turnover that have hurt checkers performance still his clients say he is invaluable for his ability to guide entrepreneurs through what is often a bewildering and intimidating process  attempting to find a suitable underwriter or lender i know the chemical business says john macdonald president of jlm industries inc a tampa based chemical distributor that with tunstall consultings help recently filed to go public but the public markets are completely foreign to me mr tunstall is kind of the financial equivalent of a marriage broker says mr macdonald who cant discuss specifics of his proposed public offering because he is in the quiet period in the early s when mr tunstall first began pitching florida companies to the street they were a much tougher sell at the time the states lingering reputation as a haven for pennystock scams hurt the ability of legitimate companies to raise cash in the public markets mr tunstall offered a fresh perspective on the state by focusing on solid companies that while small offered growth potential he has helped lots of entrepreneurs grow their business says dick dobkin florida area director of entrepreneurial services at ernst  young llp in tampa sphere of influence tunstall consultings forte is matching companies with the financing source that offers the highest valuation deals brokered by the firm often attract more than a few prospective investment bankers that then bid up the amount of capital just to get the business and clients say its more than just the detailed business plans prepared by the firm that get financiers attention its mr tunstall himself gordon will effectively negotiate the deal for you says marshall hunt chief executive officer at horizon medical products inc a private company in atlanta horizon recently hired mr tunstall to help it raise  million for an acquisition while theres no guarantee that a deal brokered by mr tunstall will in fact get done his name does at least open doors gordons calls get returned first says rob shuler comanaging partner at petra capital llc in nashville he has taken the time to understand what we do mr shuler says his investment firm rejects most of the  or so unsolicited proposals it receives each month many of which are from companies seeking underwriting for a public offering petra which provides private financing mostly bridge loans isnt even in that business for someone who wheels and deals in the highstakes game of corporate finance the boyish looking mr tunstall doesnt immediately come across as a tycoon his firms headquarters offer a view of trash dumpsters at a shopping center he owns in the suburbs of north tampa about a mile from his house he rarely takes clients to fancy restaurants instead serving takeout food in his conference room his trademark power lunch is a rotisserie chicken from boston market sharing in the wealth but he does know how to make money though his fees dont include equity stakes in his clients companies mr tunstall usually buys their shares in the open market a practice that by his own admission has made him financially comfortable he says he wont buy shares in any publicly traded company unless its a client its kind of a symbiotic relationship says mr tunstall who drives a limited edition bmw z styled after the roadster driven by james bond in the movie goldeneye it was a christmas gift from his wife nancy courtesy of a neimanmarcus catalog for her part mrs tunstall who is also the firms treasurer admits that when her husband first broached the subject of giving up sole ownership of tunstall consulting she balked but increasingly she fears that they will be forced to shutter the firm should mr tunstall decide to retire or even significantly reduce his workload mrs tunstall  says she is apprehensive about the changes the toughest part she says is learning to delegate and trust others with what up to this point has in many ways been their baby im just afraid she says that in five years if gordon couldnt do this anymore the firm would just go away and what about mr tunstalls investmentbanking friends though they may welcome the prospect of more deals are they concerned that mr tunstall may be diluting his firms cachet in the long run most say no we welcome the expansion says petra capitals mr shuler adding this is a very wise move on his part because gordon is stretched to the max meanwhile mr tunstall though he hasnt yet reduced his travel schedule  he is often on the road four days a week  is at least learning to focus on something besides deals last week he took his electric piano along for the ride on his private plane so that he could practice while shuttling between detroit and boston he seems to be focusing more on the time when he can delegate in order to have more time for such diversions the new tshirts he has ordered for staffers proclaim tunstall consulting  have one of our
