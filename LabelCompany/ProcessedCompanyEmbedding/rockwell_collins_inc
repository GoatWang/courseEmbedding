horizonsummaryrockwell collins produces a wide variety of products and services for the private and public sector despite strong growth prior the companys sales plateaued over the past year however the companys is poised to grow in the future overview rockwell collins nyse col produces communications and aviation systems for the private sector and the military and also provides information management services through international communications networks the companys aim is to offer a holistic product to its customers by leveraging its practices in a variety of core competencies and taking advantage of its communications networks the company sells its products to its diverse array of customers through an internal marketing and sales force it also uses a worldwide dealer network the company has three main segments commercial systems government systems and information management services commercial systems this segment supplies aviation electronics systems to manufacturers of commercial aircraft airlines and business aircraft operators the company sells products meant for both initial installation as well as for upgrades and retrofitting the companys products in this segment include touchscreen cockpit displays cabin electronics communication systems and navigation systems government systems through this segment the company produces and sells a broad range of electronic products systems and services to customers like the us department of defense other defense agencies in other governments and other international government agencies and defense contractors the company sells products meant for airborne precision weapon ground and maritime uses the company also retrofits and upgrades its products the companys products in this segment include navigation services products for aircraft flight decks aviation displays and targeting and training systems information management services this segment was created as a result of the companys  acquisition of arinc incorporated it provides communications services systems integration and security solutions across the aviation airport rail and nuclear security markets the company sells its products to a mixture of private and public customers including airlines business aircraft operators the faa airports and railroads its products include communications systems for flight communications with airports and satellites airport efficiency systems train dispatching systems control systems for nuclear power facilities and cabin connectivity systems earnings the companys sales have increased in the aggregate but have stayed the same for the past two years going from  billion in  to  billion the year after to  billion the past year net income has grown at a greater rate from  million in  to  million in  to  million in  unsurprisingly net income as a percentage of net sales has increased from  to  over the same time period col net income annual data by ycharts as the chart above illustrates the companys net income has grown by roughly  over the past few years cash flows col cash from operations annual data by ycharts as expected the companys cash flows reflect what its earnings and sales reflect its increased over the past few years but has plateaued over the past two years the plateau and sales growth in the future the recent plateau is a result of a  reduction in revenue from the commercial systems segment that offset a  increase in revenues in the information management segment and a  increase in the government systems segment according to the companys most recent k sales growth is the managements top priority the company believes that its synergy across multiple product platforms and investments in rd will allow it to be in a strong position for future growth the company expects the boeing max which is scheduled to enter service in  to be its biggest source of commercial systems revenue moving forward the company believes that increased future defense spending will increase its government systems revenue the company also hopes to take advantage of a global trend toward software based solutions to problems in order to continue to grow its information management segment which has performed strongly over the past few years and over the longer term the company also hopes to take advantage of increasing globalization in order to acquire new customers book value col book value annual data by ycharts as the chart above shows the companys book value has grown substantially over the past few years from  to  the companys total assets increased from  billion to  billion mostly as a result of more cash on hand more net inventories and more deferred income tax the companys total current liabilities increased from  billion to  billion overall total shareholders equity increased from  billion to  billion perhaps most importantly longterm debt decreased from  billion to  billion the stocks current pb ratio is a relatively high  acquisitions much of the companys recent growth has been a result of acquisitions the company made three acquisitions in  and  to enhance its business mostly with respect to communications in december of  rockwell purchased arinc a company mentioned earlier the acquisition of arinc spawned a new segment for the company and that segment information management was the fastest growing segment last year in october of last year the company finalized a deal to purchase be aerospace a leading manufacturer of aircraft cabin interiors in europe the value of the deal was  billion and was financed with cash and stock as a result of the deal rockwell collins will assume  billion in net debt the deal was completed last month although this does mean the company will assume more debt its overall book value will undoubtedly increase the acquisition will also strengthen the companys commercial systems segment and since be is a european company the acquisition will allow the company to have greater penetration in the european market conclusion despite its plateau rockwell collins seems to be a great company its had stable or growing earnings for a long time its decreased its debt and it seems to be in a good position to strengthen and grow and unlike other governmentreliant companies rockwell has a diversified array of customers what this means is that a decrease in government spending on the military will have a negative impact on rockwell but that this impact will be limited since the company sells a wide variety of products to a wide variety of customers and as is mentioned in the latest k the company can also take advantage of the synergies that arise between all the core product areas its involved in to provide a whole suite of services to its customers col data by ycharts the companys had solid growth in price over the past few years and at a pe of  it isnt exactly a steal the acquisition of be has also been priced into the companys overall price however it would make

limiter amplifier was licensed to canadian marconi co for both sales in canada and her majesties service for the war effortcitation needed collins success in constructing broadcast transmitters continued to grow selling well over a thousand up to the start of world war ii during world war ii collins expertise grew in higher power transmitters producing designs which ran well over  kilowatts of rf power on a continuous basis after the war a limited number of am transmitters were produced called the g and remain the finest in low power am transmitters w ever produced collins remained an important manufacturer of am and fm broadcast radio transmitters for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost cutting market of the s and scitation needed the transmitter line was later sold to continental electronics which continued to produce a number of collins designs under its own nameplate before phasing them out in the s shortwave transmittersedit collins produced several shortwave transmitters to the commercial market a  series production catered to the growing need of state highway patrol agencies and department of commerce aviation needs during world war ii collins produced high power transmitters for aircraft notably the art equipped with automatic tuning circuits which represented an important enhancement for airborne radio communications after world war ii collins supported both broadcast and the growing postwar amateur radio market the united states coast guard cutter uscgc courier was employed as seagoing relay station for voice of america programming using two collins b transmitters amateur radio transmitters included the v  and  kws and the rack mounted kw receiversedit around  the company introduced their first amateur radio receiver the a called the a this set achieved excellent stability for the time due to high build quality and the use of a permeability tuned oscillator pto in its second conversion stage it was one of the few double conversion superheterodynes on the market and covered only the amateur bands with the experience gained in the design of the a collins released the j receiver a general coverage hf set covering  to  mhz it would be produced in somewhat updated versions j j j for about a decade it was known as the r and was used in multiple receiver diversity rtty installations the a amateur line was updated throughout the early s finishing with the a which was released in  the collins mechanical filter was introduced to consumers in the a and the a was one of the first receivers marketed specifically as a single sideband receiver collins ra radio receiver around  collins began designing the r – mhz for the us military this was intended to be a receiver of the highest performance available with the ruggedness and serviceability required for military duty it featured direct mechanical digital frequency readout the set is composed of several modules for easy field repair—a bad module could simply be swapped out and repaired later or junked sets built during the original  contract cost the government about  each and around  were produced concurrently collins developed the r a longwave version with fewer than  made the r another variant of the r allowed choice of  different autotuned channels three years later collins delivered the ra to the military about  were produced and the set was a military workhorse until the s like the r it can outperform many modern radios to the point that it was designated top secret until the late s in  collins replaced the a series with the much smaller s series part of the sline discussed in the next section these featured mechanical filters very accurate frequency readout and excellent stability at the request of the us government collins designed the s general coverage set which was essentially in intended use a physically smaller replacement for the j series it was not intended as a replacement for the higher performance ra and unlike the ra it was extensively marketed for commercial use collins produced a few high performance solid state receivers in the s such as the s like their tube predecessors these are coveted by collectors today transceivers and systemsedit with the introduction of the sline in  collins moved from designing individual products that could be used together to ones that were designed to integrate and operate together in various combinations as a system they were the first equipment maker to take this approach collins was also the first to introduce a compact hf transceiver the kwm the year before together these two innovations put collins temporarily ahead of its competition and set the stage for other manufacturers and the next generation of amateur and military hf radio equipment the s receiver and s transmitter comprising the heart of the sline operated separately or together to transceive the units included crystal bandpass filters and a new compact pto design that provided stable highly linear tuning across  khz band segments the sline tuning dial mechanism was unique when introduced it used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution better than  khz collins sline – f power supply sb receiver s transmitter b console sm microphone circa  within a few years collins had introduced additional sline components including the s kilowatt power amplifier the l desktop power amplifier and the s transverter which provided coverage of the  meter  mhz and  meter  mhz amateur bands the kwm transceiver replaced the kwm using many of the sline’s design features and matching its styling other accessories included speakers microphones and control consoles illustrating the uniqueness of their new smaller units in the market collins advertisements in the s and early s emphasized the sline’s physical styling and size as often as they did its performance collins continued to improve the sline first introducing the s then the s units the s and a b and c receiver and the s and a transmitters the a and c units were identical to the  and b units respectively except they provided an extra set of heterodyne oscillator crystals enabling them to cover extra bands – useful for military amateur and mars operation where operation just outside the regular amateur bands was necessary collins l amplifier ca  among amateur radio operators the sline established its reputation as perhaps the most solidly engineered equipment available – and the most costly as a result sline equipment and the aline and other predecessors are restored prized and operated on the air by collectors today collins continued to produce the sline well into the late s and after its acquisition by rockwell in  with the move to solid state design the sline came to an end after a two decade production run the kwm transceiver was introduced the next year – a break with the past both in its use of transistors and digital technology and its styling it would be collins’ final entry in the amateur radio market until it was discontinued in the mids computersedit in the s the company designed and sold csystem computerized message switching equipment built an intranet and began implementing computer storage of design data for circuit boards and assemblies they had a goal of automating all functions from parts ordering and inventory to factory scheduling to generation of maintenance provisioning with products technically successful and far ahead of their time in many respects mr collins continued to invest in development at a rate that could not be supported by sales

expanded its work in all phases of the communications field while broadening its technology this moved arthur collins into a more active role as ceo guiding department leaders holding significant

sold transmitters and audio mixing consoles to the broadcast industry in  the model  speech input console in addition to the c limiter amplifier was licensed to canadian marconi co for both sales in canada and her majesties service for the war effortcitation needed collins success in constructing broadcast transmitters continued to grow selling well over a thousand up to the start of world war ii during world war ii collins expertise grew in higher power transmitters producing designs which ran well over  kilowatts of rf power on a continuous basis after the war a limited number of am transmitters were produced called the g and remain the finest in low power am transmitters w ever produced collins remained an important manufacturer of am and fm broadcast radio transmitters for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost cutting market of the s and scitation needed the transmitter line was later sold to continental electronics which continued to produce a number of collins designs under its own nameplate before phasing them out in the s shortwave transmittersedit collins produced several shortwave transmitters to the commercial market a  series production catered to the growing need of state highway patrol agencies and department of commerce aviation needs during world war ii collins produced high power transmitters for aircraft notably the art equipped with automatic tuning circuits which represented an important enhancement for airborne radio communications after world war ii collins supported both broadcast and the growing postwar amateur radio market the united states coast guard cutter uscgc courier was employed as seagoing relay station for voice of america programming using two collins b transmitters amateur radio transmitters included the v  and  kws and the rack mounted kw receiversedit around  the company introduced their first amateur radio receiver the a called the a this set achieved excellent stability for the time due to high build quality and the use of a permeability tuned oscillator pto in its second conversion stage it was one of the few double conversion superheterodynes on the market and covered only the amateur bands with the experience gained in the design of the a collins released the j receiver a general coverage hf set covering  to  mhz it would be produced in somewhat updated versions j j j for about a decade it was known as the r and was used in multiple receiver diversity rtty installations the a amateur line was updated throughout the early s finishing with the a which was released in  the collins mechanical filter was introduced to consumers in the a and the a was one of the first receivers marketed specifically as a single sideband receiver collins ra radio receiver around  collins began designing the r – mhz for the us military this was intended to be a receiver of the highest performance available with the ruggedness and serviceability required for military duty it featured direct mechanical digital frequency readout the set is composed of several modules for easy field repair—a bad module could simply be swapped out and repaired later or junked sets built during the original  contract cost the government about  each and around  were produced concurrently collins developed the r a longwave version with fewer than  made the r another variant of the r allowed choice of  different autotuned channels three years later collins delivered the ra to the military about  were produced and the set was a military workhorse until the s like the r it can outperform many modern radios to the point that it was designated top secret until the late s in  collins replaced the a series with the much smaller s series part of the sline discussed in the next section these featured mechanical filters very accurate frequency readout and excellent stability at the request of the us government collins designed the s general coverage set which was essentially in intended use a physically smaller replacement for the j series it was not intended as a replacement for the higher performance ra and unlike the ra it was extensively marketed for commercial use collins produced a few high performance solid state receivers in the s such as the s like their tube predecessors these are coveted by collectors today transceivers and systemsedit with the introduction of the sline in  collins moved from designing individual products that could be used together to ones that were designed to integrate and operate together in various combinations as a system they were the first equipment maker to take this approach collins was also the first to introduce a compact hf transceiver the kwm the year before together these two innovations put collins temporarily ahead of its competition and set the stage for other manufacturers and the next generation of amateur and military hf radio equipment the s receiver and s transmitter comprising the heart of the sline operated separately or together to transceive the units included crystal bandpass filters and a new compact pto design that provided stable highly linear tuning across  khz band segments the sline tuning dial mechanism was unique when introduced it used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution better than  khz collins sline – f power supply sb receiver s transmitter b console sm microphone circa  within a few years collins had introduced additional sline components including the s kilowatt power amplifier the l desktop power amplifier and the s transverter which provided coverage of the  meter  mhz and  meter  mhz amateur bands the kwm transceiver replaced the kwm using many of the sline’s design features and matching its styling other accessories included speakers microphones and control consoles illustrating the uniqueness of their new smaller units in the market collins advertisements in the s and early s emphasized the sline’s physical styling and size as often as they did its performance collins continued to improve the sline first introducing the s then the s units the s and a b and c receiver and the s and a transmitters the a and c units were identical to the  and b units respectively except they provided an extra set of heterodyne oscillator crystals enabling them to cover extra bands – useful for military amateur and mars operation where operation just outside the regular amateur bands was necessary collins l amplifier ca  among amateur radio operators the sline established its reputation as perhaps the most solidly engineered equipment available – and the most costly as a result sline equipment and the aline and other predecessors are restored prized and operated on the air by collectors today collins continued to produce the sline well into the late s and after its acquisition by rockwell in  with the move to solid state design the sline came to an end after a two decade production run the kwm transceiver was
