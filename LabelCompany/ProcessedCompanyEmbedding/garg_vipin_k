morning and thank you for joining us this morning today marks the transformative milestone from neos therapeutics with the us launch adzenys xrodt our first commercially available product utilizing our proprietary extendedrelease orally disintegrating technology platform for the treatment of adhd following the fda approval of adzenys xrodt in january we began our prelaunch preparations including hiring a sales team of approximately  highly qualified sales representatives training the team and defining our gotomarket strategy our sales force is now deployed and actively engaging with healthcare professionals across the united states we are encouraged by the initial feedback from physicians during the prelaunch phase and we are even more confident that there is a strong desire on the part of physicians and caregivers for once daily orally disintegrating treatment alternative to health managed adhd we are pleased that we can now provide this solution to physicians and their patients adzenys xrodt is available in six different dosage strengths that therapeutically equivalent to adderall xr we believe that physicians will initially prescribe adzenys xrodt to children diagnosed with adhd that have difficulty swallowing pill over the next several months our sales force will engage with physicians who are most actively treating children with adhd we look forward to offering patients their parents and caregivers with this new treatment options ahead of the backtoschool season this summer and expanding our focus into newly diagnosed pediatric patients and adolescent and adult patients keeping patient cost as a reasonable level to ensure access is an important consideration were offering a coupon in which patients can receive a day freetrial of adzenys xrodt as well as a program of up to oneyear in which patients pay as little less  per prescription this morning we also announced the closing of a  million term debt financing this financing further strengthens of cash position and we believe it provides neos with increased financial flexibility and resources to commercialize adzenys xrodt and bring to market our other two product candidates cotempla xrodt our methylphenidate extendedrelease orally disintegrating tablet and nt our amphetamine extendedrelease liquid drug candidate assuming positive regulatory decision rich will provide additional details on the debt financing shortly lastly i would like to remind everyone of the timelines of cotempla xrodt and nt which remain unchanged since our last quarterly update these are as follows for cotempla xrodt we are ontrack to complete the bridging study in the third quarter of this year to demonstrate bioequivalence between clinical trial material and the tobemarketed drug product including an assessment of food effect we also are on trial to provide validations and threemonths of stability data for the tobemarketed drug product as outlined by the complete response letter received from the fda last year and to resubmit the nda during the fourth quarter of this year if approved we believe we will have the only two extendedrelease orally disintegrating tablets for the two most commonly prescribed drugs for adhd on the market by the  backtoschool season for nt our amphetamine xr liquid drug candidate we expect to submit an nda in the fourth quarter of  and if approved nt is positioned to be an amphetamine xr liquid suspension for onceaday treatment of adhd providing further treatment alternatives for adhd patients and caregivers we also manufacture and market a generic equivalent to the branded product tussionex tussionex is indicated for the relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies and colds in adults and children sixyears of age and older now i will turn the call over to rich who will review first quarter  financial results rich richard i eisenstadt thanks vipin at march   our cash cash equivalents and investments amounted to  million with regard to todays term debt financing and absent payments on that loan are interest only for first months and the principal is to be repaid in four equal annual installments of  million to be paid annually commencing in may  and continuing through may  there are no warrant for any other equity to be issued as a result of this financing back to the quarterly financial results total revenues were  million for the threemonths ended march   an increase of  million compared with the threemonths ended march   all  million revenue was generated from net sales of the companys generic tussionex the  million increase primarily resulted from sales to a large pharmacy chain in  which contract was initiated in the second fiscal quarter of  cost of goods sold was  million for the threemonths ended march   an increase of  million compared to the threemonths ended march   due to the increase in tussionex sales gross profit for the quarter was  compared to a gross loss of  in the same period of  research and development expenses were  million for the threemonths ended march   a decrease of  million compared to the threemonths ended march   this decrease was primarily due to the fda filing fee submitted in january  for cotempla xrodt sales and marketing expenses were  million for the threemonths ended march   compared to  for the threemonths ended march   the increase was primarily due to precommercialization activities for adzenys xrodt and increased salary expense associated with building out the commercial team general and administrative expenses were  million for the threemonths ended march   an increase of  million from the threemonths ended march   due to an increase in sharebased compensation and costs associated with being a public company the company reported a net loss of  million in the threemonths ended march   compared with  million for the same period in  as we have mentioned previously we anticipate that sales of adzenys xrodt in  during this awareness building period will be modest in future quarters we intend to recognize adzenys xrodt revenue based on filled prescriptions we’re happy to take questions at this time operator please begin the questionandanswer session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from randall stanicky from rbc capital markets your line is now open randall stanicky great thanks guys i just have two questions the first one can you talk about the commercial rollout and specifically the adzenys targeting is this a pediatric first detail or do you guys plan to position the product initially earlier in the box towards the adult population as well and then also i think vipin i think you mentioned early feedback can you just expand on what that early feedback has been that you have heard from physicians or from the medical community that would be great thanks vipin k garg sure tom do you want to take these two questions thomas p mcdonnell yes certainly good morning randall randall stanicky hey thomas p mcdonnell so our targeting approach has been very much skewed towards the highest rating physicians in the marketplace we have over weighted that to pediatric versus adult and really focused on the extendedrelease component of the market and that inherently leads you to a greater pediatric population because of the high immediate release issues in the adult patients so really what we’re looking at is child and adolescent psychiatrist and pediatricians makeup  of our targeting one interesting note though is we are touching a pretty considerable amount of adult business through the child and adolescent psychiatrist who have over the years have become more active and treating adult but overall i would say we’re skewing towards the pediatric segment that’s really the first place the physicians think of when they hear about adzenys xrodt and we plan to capture that segment of the market and then be able to move on and grow from there because we do feel that this does some utilities within the adults and i think as really where to your next point where some of the early feedback we’ve been hearing is from doctors that once they hear the story once they understand all the components of what adzenys xrodt has to offer they say this is a real need in my marketplace for many different reasons obviously for kids that cant swallow or don’t want as swallow this is an easier way to do it but then they go to other patient types such as newly diagnosed new patients so on average a kid sevenyears old have probably never swallowed a pill in their life this is a better way to start to even the adults onthego and this more of convenience factor so that’s really some of the early feedback we’ve been hearing randall stanicky and let me just ask followup because obviously this is a big backtoschool i would assume focus just to set expectations how should we think about the ramp in the launch as we watch scripts between now and the summers months and into the following to backtoschool thomas p mcdonnell yes exactly so that’s one of the thing that we’ve been looking at and we feel we’re very fortunate to be launching at this time we’re going to start seeing data coming in from the market at the end of this month and one of the things that is very important for everyone to realize is this is the end of the school year there is not many newly diagnosed patients coming in and getting diagnose with adhd for the first time at the end of this school year there is certainly not a lot of switching in this market right now as kids are getting ready to go to summer so we’re really looking for may june july to be those times where some of the key physicians will get some early utilization though understand how this product is working but we certainly don’t expect to see a big ramp but it will enable us to definitely get awareness up and get the message about adzenys xrodt prior to the backtoschool season which you really see starting in august through november randall stanicky perfect that’s great thanks guys operator our next question comes from jason butler from jmp securities your line is now open jason butler hi thanks for taking the questions could you just maybe review for us the work you have done so far with payers and how you expect the product to be reimbursed during the initial launch phase as well as your efforts to lower patients’ outofpocket cost obviously thanks vipin k garg you bet jason thanks for the question one of the things obviously that all new products go through is working through payers we’ve been very active with the payers from the beginning and with market research but now also with making calls our payer customers one of the big pieces of feedback that we got from payers early on was if you come in with in the range of the other extendedrelease products in this marketplace we won’t disadvantage you this is a unique product it’s a product that’s needed in certain populations and we support that so that always has been our strategy weve come inline with the other extendedrelease products in adhd as far as total cost right as far as what we are charging now from there would be many plans that will decide on what to do the majority of commercial payers will place at adzenys xrodt on tier non preferred but like all new products though there is going to be some plans that put a restriction on the brand at launch we have been calling on these customers we’ve been working with them we’ve a team of very experienced account managers out there right now working with the payers to talk off any of those restrictions and that’s on our commercial side we have already had some very encouraging placements within the healthcare companies and we’ve also had some great meetings and great negotiations so we’re optimistic right now on the commercial book of business the medicate book of business though is also very important to us and we’re working right now with the states to gain some formulary access in  and then your second question was how are we controlling outofpocket cost we are working with a company to make sure that we have many coupons available so that when someone goes to the pharmacy to get a prescription they walk away with that prescription so we’re using a free day coupon to get them started and then pay as little as  for the next months and we fell that the way that weve structured these cards this will be a good tool for us to ensure that we get those scripts filled at the pharmacy operator operator instructions our next question comes from david maris from wells fargo your line is now open david maris good morning you mentioned modest sales for  can you put some directions around that and also given that you have the threemonth lead up to the backtoschool season if you could explain why it would be modest other than its just a launch of a new product thank you richard i eisenstadt well david really because it’s launch of a new product we haven’t given guidance to market share we’ve often sided excess of school event in the first couple of years and we feel that that’s a decent analog although we look at all market basket of adhd products but really backtoschool season being august september october that’s one we expect the new starts to be the build off there so if that’s helpful david maris okay it is in and so you are using school event what do you think could have invest your as sort of your benchmark richard i eisenstadt we i wouldn’t say it’s exactly our benchmark we do looking in basket of a number of different adhd products but it thinks a great analog for launch of a new product in adhd as an alternative dosage form vipin k garg yes what i would say david is that we look at school event as an analog for a market penetration but we feel that opportunity for an odt is much bigger than a liquid suspension so we talked about how and weve done physician surveys as well as talk to caregivers and parents there seems to be a presence of as much as four times as much presence for an odt over the liquid suspension so clearly the market opportunity we believe the addressable market is much bigger than that that of a liquid suspensions school event gives to that launch curve that we sort of use as an analog of the opportunity being several times bigger than that for a liquid suspension david maris okay thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i’ll turn the call back over to vipin garg for closing remarks vipin k garg thank you thank you for joining us this morning i wanted to remind everyone that we will be presenting at ubs global healthcare conference in new york on tuesday may
