sister mary ann was born in september  but died in august  drawing of st johns church margate by turner from around  when he would have been  or  years old the ambitious but unsure drawing shows an early struggle with perspective which can be contrasted with his later work a view of the archbishops palace lambeth – this watercolour was turners first to be accepted for the royal academys annual exhibition in april  the month he turned  the image is a technical presentation of turners strong grasp of the elements of perspective with several buildings at sharp angles to each other demonstrating turners thorough mastery of thomas maltons topographical style fishermen at sea exhibited in  was the first oil painting exhibited by turner at the royal academy modern rome – campo vaccino bonneville savoy  dallas museum of art oil on canvas  x  cm in  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st lukes hospital for lunatics in old street in  and then bethlem hospital in  where she died in  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle joseph mallord william marshall in brentford then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswells picturesque view of the antiquities of england and wales around  turner was sent to margate on the northeast kent coast here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work turner returned to margate many times in later life by this time turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that my son sir is going to be a painter in  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire now part of oxfordshire a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford the use of pencil sketches on location as the foundation for later finished paintings formed the basis of turners essential working style for his whole career many early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective and it is known that as a young man he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick james wyatt and joseph bonomi the elder by the end of  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton specialised in london views turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys he would later call malton my real master topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies royal academyedit in the same year of  he entered the royal academy of art schools at the age of  and was accepted into the academy a year later sir joshua reynolds president of the royal academy chaired the panel that admitted him at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishops palace lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of  when turner was  as a probationer in the academy he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures from july  to october  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times in june  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain particularly to wales where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours these particularly focused on architectural work which utilised his skills as a draughtsman in  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincents rock bristol now lost which foreshadowed his later climatic effects cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipiditiesand evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated in  turner exhibited fishermen at sea his first oil painting at the academy of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermens lantern wilton said that the image is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the th century and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet philip james de loutherbourg peter monamy and francis swaine who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter some later work however was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes early careeredit turner travelled widely in europe starting with france and switzerland in  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year he made many visits to venice on a visit to lyme regis in dorset he painted a stormy scene now in the cincinnati art museum important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes of farnley hall near otley in yorkshire who became a close friend of the artist turner first visited otley in  aged  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george obrien wyndham rd earl of egremont at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside including a view of the chichester canal petworth house still displays a number of paintings personal lifeedit as turner grew older he became more eccentric he had few close friends except for his father who lived with him for  years and worked as his studio assistant his fathers death in  had a profound effect on him and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression he never married but had a relationship with an older widow sarah danby he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in  and  later he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died living for about  years as mr booth in her house in chelsea like many of the day turner was a habitual user of snuff in  the king of france louisphilippe presented a gold snuff box to him of two other snuffboxes an agate and silver example bears turners name and another made of wood was collected along with his spectacles magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper deathedit turner died of cholera in the house of his lover sophia caroline booth in cheyne walk in chelsea on  december  and is said to have uttered the last words the sun is god though this may be apocryphal at his request he was buried in st pauls cathedral where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his last exhibition at the royal academy was in  turners friend architect philip hardwick – son of his tutor thomas hardwick was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that i must inform you we have lost him other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral henry harpur iv benefactor of westminster – now chelsea  westminster – hospital revd henry scott trimmer george jones ra and charles turner ara artedit dutch boats in a gale  joseph mallord william turner dutch fishing boats in a storm or a rising gale  willem van de velde the younger for his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the younger styleedit one of turners most successful house portraits raby castle the seat of the earl of darlington the walters art museum turners talent was recognised early in his life financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint according to david pipers the illustrated history of art his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles turner was recognised as an artistic genius influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of nature suitable vehicles for turners imagination were found in shipwrecks fires such as the burning of parliament in  an event which turner rushed to witness firsthand and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea as seen in dawn after the wreck  and the slave ship  snow storm steamboat off a harbours mouth  turners major venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum book of studies seventy prints that he worked on from  to  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art the idea was loosely based on claude lorrains liber veritatis book of truth where claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings by then at devonshire house had been a huge publishing success turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated and categorised the genre into six types marine mountainous pastoral historical architectural and elevated or epic pastoral his printmaking was a major part of his output and a museum is devoted to it the turner museum in sarasota florida founded in  by douglass montrosegraem to house his collection of turner prints turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merrymaking or working in the foreground but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the sublime nature of the world on the other sublime here means aweinspiring savage grandeur a natural world unmastered by man evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period to turner light was the emanation of gods spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail concentrating on the play of light on water the radiance of skies and fires although these late paintings appear to be impressionistic and therefore a forerunner of the french school turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world rather than responding primarily to optical phenomenacitation needed rain steam and speed – the great western railway painted  his early works such as tintern abbey  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape however in hannibal crossing the alps  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play his distinctive style of painting in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints created lightness fluency and ephemeral atmospheric effects in his later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain steam and speed – the great western railway where the objects are barely recognisable the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turners work in the vanguard of english painting but exerted an influence on art in france the impressionists particularly claude monet carefully studied his techniques chichester canals vivid colours may have been influenced by the eruption of mount tambora in  high levels of volcanic ash from the eruption of mt tambora in the atmosphere during  the year without a summer led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period and were an inspiration for some of turners work john ruskin says in his notes on turner in march  that an early patron dr thomas monro the principal physician of bedlam and also a collector and amateur artist was a significant influence on turners style his true master was dr monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself it is impossible to overestimate together with a number of young artists turner was able in the london house of dr monro to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens some of which were present in monros house went far further than the neat renderings of topography the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe circa  he met the irish physician robert james graves graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in sat beside him and soon took from his pocket a notebook across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning graves wondered if the man was insane he looked saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist the two travelled and sketched together for months graves tells that turner would outline a scene sit doing nothing for two or three days then suddenly perhaps on the third day he would exclaim there it is and seizing his colours work rapidly till he had noted down the peculiar effect he wished to fix in his memory wreckers coast of northumberland painted ca  yale center for

turner had on hand and was willing to sell for £ leslie selected and shipped the  atmospheric seascape staffa fingals cave worried about the paintings reception by lenox who knew turners work only through etchings leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa a most poetic picture of a steam boat would become apparent in time on receiving the painting lenox was baffled and greatly disappointed by what he called the paintings indistinctness when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner turner said you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte staffa fingals cave is now owned by the yale center for british art materialsedit turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments using several within a few years of their dates of discovery turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings despite knowing that they were not longlasting and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments as a result many of his colours have now faded john ruskin complained at how quickly turners work decayed turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied by  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading legacyedit turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works his will was contested and in  after a court battle his first cousins including thomas price turner received part of his fortune another portion went to the royal academy of arts which occasionally awards students the turner medal his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site and the parsimony of british governments twentytwo years after his death the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in  the main part of the turner bequest which includes unfinished paintings and drawings was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art now tate britain in  a new wing at the tate the clore gallery was opened to house the turner bequest though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turners condition that they be kept and shown together increasingly paintings are lent abroad ignoring turners provision that they be kept constantly in turners gallery after the turner content was diminished and diluted in the clore gallery from c  in – only two of the nine rooms on the main floor were devoted to turner the claim that the tate was fulfilling turners wishes was dropped in  when the charity commission said that the turner bequest had been free of turners

between late april and early may  his exact date of birth is unknown the date of  april which is both saint georges day and the supposed birthday of william shakespeare was the date turner himself claimed to have been born but this claim has never been verified the first verifiable date is that turner was baptised on  may this casts some doubt on  april date as high infant mortality rates meant parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth c mary marshall died in  after having been committed in  to st lukes hospital and then to the bethlem royal hospital a mental asylum

biographyedit early lifeedit the house in maiden lane where turner was born cs joseph mallord william turner was born on  april  and baptised on  mayc he was born in maiden lane covent garden in london england his father william turner – september  was a barber and wig maker his mother mary marshall came from a family of butchers a younger sister mary ann was born in september  but died in august  drawing of st johns church margate by turner from around  when he would have been  or  years old the ambitious but unsure drawing shows an early struggle with perspective which can be contrasted with his later work a view of the archbishops palace lambeth – this watercolour was turners first to be accepted for the royal academys annual exhibition in april  the month he turned  the image is a technical presentation of turners strong grasp of the elements of perspective with several buildings at sharp angles to each other demonstrating turners thorough mastery of thomas maltons topographical style fishermen at sea exhibited in  was the first oil painting exhibited by turner at the royal academy modern rome – campo vaccino bonneville savoy  dallas museum of art oil on canvas  x  cm in  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st lukes hospital for lunatics in old street in  and then bethlem hospital in  where she died in  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle joseph mallord william marshall in brentford then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswells picturesque view of the antiquities of england and wales around  turner was sent to margate on the northeast kent coast here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work turner returned to margate many times in later life by this time turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that my son sir is going to be a painter in  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire now part of oxfordshire a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford the use of pencil sketches on location as the foundation for later finished paintings formed the basis of turners essential working style for his whole career many early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective and it is known that as a young man he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick james wyatt and joseph bonomi the elder by the end of  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton specialised in london views turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys he would later call malton my real master topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies royal academyedit in the same year of  he entered the royal academy of art schools at the age of  and was accepted into the academy a year later sir joshua reynolds president of the royal academy chaired the panel that admitted him at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishops palace lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of  when turner was  as a probationer in the academy he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures from july  to october  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times in june  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain particularly to wales where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours these particularly focused on architectural work which utilised his skills as a draughtsman in  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincents rock bristol now lost which foreshadowed his later climatic effects cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipiditiesand evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated in  turner exhibited fishermen at sea his first oil painting at the academy of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermens lantern wilton said that the image is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the th century and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet philip james de loutherbourg peter monamy and francis swaine who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter some later work however was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes early careeredit turner travelled widely in europe starting with france and switzerland in  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year he made many visits to venice on a visit to lyme regis in dorset he painted a stormy scene now in the cincinnati art museum important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes of farnley hall near otley in yorkshire who became a close friend of the artist turner first visited otley in  aged  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george obrien wyndham rd earl of egremont at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside including a view of the chichester canal petworth house still displays a number of paintings personal lifeedit as turner grew older he became more eccentric he had few close friends except for his father who lived with him for  years and worked as his studio assistant his fathers death in  had a profound effect on him and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression he never married but had a relationship with an older widow sarah danby he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in  and  later he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died living for about  years as mr booth in her house in chelsea like many of the day turner was a habitual user of snuff in  the king of france louisphilippe presented a gold snuff box to him of two other snuffboxes an agate and silver example bears turners name and another made of wood was collected along with his spectacles magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper deathedit turner died of cholera in the house of his lover sophia caroline booth in cheyne walk in chelsea on  december  and is said to have uttered the last words the sun is god though this may be apocryphal at his request he was buried in st pauls cathedral where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his last exhibition at the royal academy was in  turners friend architect philip hardwick – son of his tutor thomas hardwick was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that i must inform you we have lost him other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral henry harpur iv benefactor of westminster – now chelsea  westminster – hospital revd henry scott trimmer george jones ra and charles turner ara artedit dutch boats in a gale  joseph mallord william turner dutch fishing boats in a storm or a rising gale  willem van de velde the younger for his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the younger styleedit one of turners most successful house portraits raby castle the seat of the earl of darlington the walters art museum turners talent was recognised early in his life financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint according to david pipers the illustrated history of art his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles turner was recognised as an artistic genius influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of nature suitable vehicles for turners imagination were found in shipwrecks fires such as the burning of parliament in  an event which turner rushed to witness firsthand and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea as seen in dawn after the wreck  and the slave ship  snow storm steamboat off a harbours mouth  turners major venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum book of studies seventy prints that he worked on from  to  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art the idea was loosely based on claude lorrains liber veritatis book of truth where claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings by then at devonshire house had been a huge publishing success turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated and categorised the genre into six types marine mountainous pastoral historical architectural and elevated or epic pastoral his printmaking was a major part of his output and a museum is devoted to it the turner museum in sarasota florida founded in  by douglass montrosegraem to house his collection of turner prints turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merrymaking or working in the foreground but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the sublime nature of the world on the other sublime here means aweinspiring savage grandeur a natural world unmastered by man evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period to turner light was the emanation of gods spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail concentrating on the play of light on water the radiance of skies and fires although these late paintings appear to be impressionistic and therefore a forerunner of the french school turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world rather than responding primarily to optical phenomenacitation needed rain steam and speed – the great western railway painted  his early works such as tintern abbey  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape however in hannibal crossing the alps  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play his distinctive style of painting in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints created lightness fluency and ephemeral atmospheric effects in his later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain steam and speed – the great western railway where the objects are barely recognisable the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turners work in the vanguard of english painting but exerted an influence on art in france the impressionists particularly claude monet carefully studied his techniques chichester canals vivid colours may have been influenced by the eruption of mount tambora in  high levels of volcanic ash from the eruption of mt tambora in the atmosphere during  the year without a summer led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period and were an inspiration for some of turners work john ruskin says in his notes on turner in march  that an early patron dr thomas monro the principal physician of bedlam and also a collector and amateur artist was a significant influence on turners style his true master was dr monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself it is impossible to overestimate together with a number of young artists turner was able in the london house of dr monro to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens some of which were present in monros house went far further than the neat renderings of topography the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe circa  he met the irish physician robert james graves graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in sat beside him and soon took from his pocket a notebook across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning graves wondered if the man was insane he looked saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist the two travelled and sketched together for months graves tells that turner would outline a scene sit doing nothing for two or three days then suddenly perhaps on the third day he would exclaim there it is and seizing his colours work rapidly till he had noted down the peculiar effect he wished to fix in his memory wreckers coast of northumberland painted ca  yale center for british art an engraving of a sketch by turner depicting brougham castle

collector lenox wished to own a turner and in  bought one unseen through an intermediary his friend c r leslie from among the paintings turner had on hand and was willing to sell for £ leslie selected and shipped the  atmospheric seascape staffa fingals cave worried about the paintings reception by lenox who knew turners work only through etchings leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa a most poetic picture of a steam boat would become apparent in time on receiving the painting lenox was baffled and greatly disappointed by what he called the paintings indistinctness when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner turner said you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte staffa fingals cave is now owned by the yale center for british art materialsedit turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments using several within a few years of their dates of discovery turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings despite knowing that they were not longlasting and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments as a result many of his colours have now faded john ruskin complained at how quickly turners work decayed turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied by  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading legacyedit turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works his will was contested and in  after a court battle his first cousins including thomas price turner received part of his fortune another portion went to the royal academy of arts which occasionally awards students the turner medal his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site and the parsimony of british governments twentytwo years after his death the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in  the main part of the turner bequest which includes unfinished paintings and drawings was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art now tate britain in  a new wing at the tate the clore gallery was opened to house the turner bequest though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turners condition that they be kept and shown together increasingly paintings are lent abroad ignoring turners provision that they be kept constantly in turners gallery after the turner content was diminished and diluted in the clore gallery from c  in – only two of the nine rooms on the main floor were devoted to turner the claim that the tate was fulfilling turners wishes was dropped in  when the charity commission said that the turner bequest had been free of turners conditions this was challenged by leolin price qccitation needed st marys church

date of  april which is both saint georges day and the supposed birthday of william shakespeare was the date turner himself claimed to have been born but this claim has never been verified the first verifiable date is that turner was baptised on  may this casts some doubt on  april date as high infant mortality rates meant parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth c mary

biographyedit early lifeedit the house in maiden lane where turner was born cs joseph mallord william turner was born on  april  and baptised on  mayc he was born in maiden lane covent garden in london england his father william turner – september  was a barber and wig maker his mother mary marshall came from a family of butchers a younger sister mary ann was born in september  but died in august  drawing of st johns church margate by turner from around  when he would have been  or  years old the ambitious but unsure drawing shows an early struggle with perspective which can be contrasted with his later work a view of the archbishops palace lambeth – this watercolour was turners first to be accepted for the royal academys annual exhibition in april  the month he turned  the image is a technical presentation of turners strong grasp of the elements of perspective with several buildings at sharp angles to each other demonstrating turners thorough mastery of thomas maltons topographical style fishermen at sea exhibited in  was the first oil painting exhibited by turner at the royal academy modern rome – campo vaccino bonneville savoy  dallas museum of art oil on canvas  x  cm in  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st lukes hospital for lunatics in old street in  and then bethlem hospital in  where she died in  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle joseph mallord william marshall in brentford then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswells picturesque view of the antiquities of england and wales around  turner was sent to margate on the northeast kent coast here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work turner returned to margate many times in later life by this time turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that my son sir is going to be a painter in  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire now part of oxfordshire a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford the use of pencil sketches on location as the foundation for later finished paintings formed the basis of turners essential working style for his whole career many early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective and it is known that as a young man he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick james wyatt and joseph bonomi the elder by the end of  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton specialised in london views turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys he would later call malton my real master topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies royal academyedit in the same year of  he entered the royal academy of art schools at the age of  and was accepted into the academy a year later sir joshua reynolds president of the royal academy chaired the panel that admitted him at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishops palace lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of  when turner was  as a probationer in the academy he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures from july  to october  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times in june  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain particularly to wales where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours these particularly focused on architectural work which utilised his skills as a draughtsman in  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincents rock bristol now lost which foreshadowed his later climatic effects cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipiditiesand evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated in  turner exhibited fishermen at sea his first oil painting at the academy of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermens lantern wilton said that the image is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the th century and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet philip james de loutherbourg peter monamy and francis swaine who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter some later work however was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes early careeredit turner travelled widely in europe starting with france and switzerland in  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year he made many visits to venice on a visit to lyme regis in dorset he painted a stormy scene now in the cincinnati art museum important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes of farnley hall near otley in yorkshire who became a close friend of the artist turner first visited otley in  aged  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george obrien wyndham rd earl of egremont at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside including a view of the chichester canal petworth house still displays a number of paintings personal lifeedit as turner grew older he became more eccentric he had few close friends except for his father who lived with him for  years and worked as his studio assistant his fathers death in  had a profound effect on him and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression he never married but had a relationship with an older widow sarah danby he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in  and  later he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died living for about  years as mr booth in her house in chelsea like many of the day turner was a habitual user of snuff in  the king of france louisphilippe presented a gold snuff box to him of two other snuffboxes an agate and silver example bears turners name and another made of wood was collected along with his spectacles magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper deathedit turner died of cholera in the house of his lover sophia caroline booth in cheyne walk in chelsea on  december  and is said to have uttered the last words the sun is god though this may be apocryphal at his request he was buried in st pauls cathedral where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his last exhibition at the royal academy was in  turners friend architect philip hardwick – son of his tutor thomas hardwick was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that i must inform you we have lost him other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral henry harpur iv benefactor of westminster – now chelsea  westminster – hospital revd henry scott trimmer george jones ra and charles turner ara artedit dutch boats in a gale  joseph mallord william turner dutch fishing boats in a storm or a rising gale  willem van de velde the younger for his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the younger styleedit one of turners most successful house portraits raby castle the seat of the earl of darlington the walters art museum turners talent was recognised early in his life financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint according to david pipers the illustrated history of art his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles turner was recognised as an artistic genius influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of nature suitable vehicles for turners imagination were found in shipwrecks fires such as the burning of parliament in  an event which turner rushed to witness firsthand and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea as seen in dawn after the wreck  and the slave ship  snow storm steamboat off a harbours mouth  turners major venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum book of studies seventy prints that he worked on from  to  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art the idea was loosely based on claude lorrains liber veritatis book of truth where claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings by then at devonshire house had been a huge publishing success turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated and categorised the genre into six types marine mountainous pastoral historical architectural and elevated or epic pastoral his printmaking was a major part of his output and a museum is devoted to it the turner museum in sarasota florida founded in  by douglass montrosegraem to house his collection of turner prints turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merrymaking or working in the foreground but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the sublime nature of the world on the other sublime here means aweinspiring savage grandeur a natural world unmastered by man evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period to turner light was the emanation of gods spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail concentrating on the play of light on water the radiance of skies and fires although these late paintings appear to be impressionistic and therefore a forerunner of the french school turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world rather than responding primarily to optical phenomenacitation needed rain steam and speed – the great western railway painted  his early works such as tintern abbey  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape however in hannibal crossing the alps  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play his distinctive style of painting in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints created lightness fluency and ephemeral atmospheric effects in his later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain steam and speed – the great western railway where the objects are barely recognisable the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turners work in the vanguard of english painting but exerted an influence on art in france the impressionists particularly claude monet carefully studied his techniques chichester canals vivid colours may have been influenced by the eruption of mount tambora in  high levels of volcanic ash from the eruption of mt tambora in the atmosphere during  the year without a summer led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period and were an inspiration for some of turners work john ruskin says in his notes on turner in march  that an early patron dr thomas monro the principal physician of bedlam and also a collector and amateur artist was a significant influence on turners style his true master was dr monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself it is impossible to overestimate together with a number of young artists turner was able in the london house of dr monro to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens some of which were present in monros house went far further than the neat renderings of topography the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe circa  he met the irish physician robert james graves graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in sat beside him and soon took from his pocket a notebook across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning graves wondered if the man was insane he looked saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist the two travelled and sketched together for months graves tells that turner would outline a scene sit doing nothing for two or three days then suddenly perhaps on the third day he would exclaim there it is and seizing his colours work rapidly till he had noted down the peculiar effect he wished to fix in his memory wreckers coast of northumberland painted ca  yale center for british art an engraving of a sketch by turner depicting brougham castle

collector lenox wished to own a turner and in  bought one unseen through an intermediary his friend c r leslie from among the paintings turner had on hand and was willing to sell for £ leslie selected and shipped the  atmospheric seascape staffa fingals cave worried about the paintings reception by lenox who knew turners work only through etchings leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa a most poetic picture of a steam boat would become apparent in time on receiving the painting lenox was baffled and greatly disappointed by what he called the paintings indistinctness when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner turner said you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte staffa fingals cave is now owned by the yale center for british art materialsedit turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments using several within a few years of their dates of discovery turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings despite knowing that they were not longlasting and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments as a result many of his colours have now faded john ruskin complained at how quickly turners work decayed turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied by  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading legacyedit turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works his will was contested and in  after a court battle his first cousins including thomas price turner received part of his fortune another portion went to the royal academy of arts which occasionally awards students the turner medal his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site and the parsimony of british governments twentytwo years after his death the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in  the main part of the turner bequest which includes unfinished paintings and drawings was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art now tate britain in  a new wing at the tate the clore gallery was opened to house the turner bequest though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turners condition that they be kept and shown together increasingly paintings are lent abroad ignoring turners provision that they be kept constantly in turners gallery after the turner content was diminished and diluted in the clore gallery from c  in – only two of the nine rooms on the main floor were devoted to turner the claim that the tate was fulfilling turners wishes was dropped in  when the charity commission said that the turner bequest had been free of turners conditions this was challenged by leolin price qccitation needed st marys church

date of  april which is both saint georges day and the supposed birthday of william shakespeare was the date turner himself claimed to have been born but this claim has never been verified the first verifiable date is that turner was baptised on  may this casts some doubt on  april date as high infant mortality rates meant parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth c mary

biographyedit early lifeedit the house in maiden lane where turner was born cs joseph mallord william turner was born on  april  and baptised on  mayc he was born in maiden lane covent garden in london england his father william turner – september  was a barber and wig maker his mother mary marshall came from a family of butchers a younger sister mary ann was born in september  but died in august  drawing of st johns church margate by turner from around  when he would have been  or  years old the ambitious but unsure drawing shows an early struggle with perspective which can be contrasted with his later work a view of the archbishops palace lambeth – this watercolour was turners first to be accepted for the royal academys annual exhibition in april  the month he turned  the image is a technical presentation of turners strong grasp of the elements of perspective with several buildings at sharp angles to each other demonstrating turners thorough mastery of thomas maltons topographical style fishermen at sea exhibited in  was the first oil painting exhibited by turner at the royal academy modern rome – campo vaccino bonneville savoy  dallas museum of art oil on canvas  x  cm in  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st lukes hospital for lunatics in old street in  and then bethlem hospital in  where she died in  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle joseph mallord william marshall in brentford then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswells picturesque view of the antiquities of england and wales around  turner was sent to margate on the northeast kent coast here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work turner returned to margate many times in later life by this time turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that my son sir is going to be a painter in  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire now part of oxfordshire a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford the use of pencil sketches on location as the foundation for later finished paintings formed the basis of turners essential working style for his whole career many early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective and it is known that as a young man he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick james wyatt and joseph bonomi the elder by the end of  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton specialised in london views turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys he would later call malton my real master topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies royal academyedit in the same year of  he entered the royal academy of art schools at the age of  and was accepted into the academy a year later sir joshua reynolds president of the royal academy chaired the panel that admitted him at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishops palace lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of  when turner was  as a probationer in the academy he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures from july  to october  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times in june  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain particularly to wales where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours these particularly focused on architectural work which utilised his skills as a draughtsman in  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincents rock bristol now lost which foreshadowed his later climatic effects cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipiditiesand evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated in  turner exhibited fishermen at sea his first oil painting at the academy of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermens lantern wilton said that the image is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the th century and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet philip james de loutherbourg peter monamy and francis swaine who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter some later work however was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes early careeredit turner travelled widely in europe starting with france and switzerland in  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year he made many visits to venice on a visit to lyme regis in dorset he painted a stormy scene now in the cincinnati art museum important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes of farnley hall near otley in yorkshire who became a close friend of the artist turner first visited otley in  aged  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george obrien wyndham rd earl of egremont at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside including a view of the chichester canal petworth house still displays a number of paintings personal lifeedit as turner grew older he became more eccentric he had few close friends except for his father who lived with him for  years and worked as his studio assistant his fathers death in  had a profound effect on him and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression he never married but had a relationship with an older widow sarah danby he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in  and  later he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died living for about  years as mr booth in her house in chelsea like many of the day turner was a habitual user of snuff in  the king of france louisphilippe presented a gold snuff box to him of two other snuffboxes an agate and silver example bears turners name and another made of wood was collected along with his spectacles magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper deathedit turner died of cholera in the house of his lover sophia caroline booth in cheyne walk in chelsea on  december  and is said to have uttered the last words the sun is god though this may be apocryphal at his request he was buried in st pauls cathedral where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his last exhibition at the royal academy was in  turners friend architect philip hardwick – son of his tutor thomas hardwick was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that i must inform you we have lost him other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral henry harpur iv benefactor of westminster – now chelsea  westminster – hospital revd henry scott trimmer george jones ra and charles turner ara artedit dutch boats in a gale  joseph mallord william turner dutch fishing boats in a storm or a rising gale  willem van de velde the younger for his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the younger styleedit one of turners most successful house portraits raby castle the seat of the earl of darlington the walters art museum turners talent was recognised early in his life financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint according to david pipers the illustrated history of art his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles turner was recognised as an artistic genius influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of nature suitable vehicles for turners imagination were found in shipwrecks fires such as the burning of parliament in  an event which turner rushed to witness firsthand and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea as seen in dawn after the wreck  and the slave ship  snow storm steamboat off a harbours mouth  turners major venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum book of studies seventy prints that he worked on from  to  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art the idea was loosely based on claude lorrains liber veritatis book of truth where claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings by then at devonshire house had been a huge publishing success turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated and categorised the genre into six types marine mountainous pastoral historical architectural and elevated or epic pastoral his printmaking was a major part of his output and a museum is devoted to it the turner museum in sarasota florida founded in  by douglass montrosegraem to house his collection of turner prints turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merrymaking or working in the foreground but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the sublime nature of the world on the other sublime here means aweinspiring savage grandeur a natural world unmastered by man evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period to turner light was the emanation of gods spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail concentrating on the play of light on water the radiance of skies and fires although these late paintings appear to be impressionistic and therefore a forerunner of the french school turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world rather than responding primarily to optical phenomenacitation needed rain steam and speed – the great western railway painted  his early works such as tintern abbey  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape however in hannibal crossing the alps  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play his distinctive style of painting in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints created lightness fluency and ephemeral atmospheric effects in his later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain steam and speed – the great western railway where the objects are barely recognisable the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turners work in the vanguard of english painting but exerted an influence on art in france the impressionists particularly claude monet carefully studied his techniques chichester canals vivid colours may have been influenced by the eruption of mount tambora in  high levels of volcanic ash from the eruption of mt tambora in the atmosphere during  the year without a summer led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period and were an inspiration for some of turners work john ruskin says in his notes on turner in march  that an early patron dr thomas monro the principal physician of bedlam and also a collector and amateur artist was a significant influence on turners style his true master was dr monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself it is impossible to overestimate together with a number of young artists turner was able in the london house of dr monro to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens some of which were present in monros house went far further than the neat renderings of topography the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe circa  he met the irish physician robert james graves graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in sat beside him and soon took from his pocket a notebook across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning graves wondered if the man was insane he looked saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist the two travelled and sketched together for months graves tells that turner would outline a scene sit doing nothing for two or three days then suddenly perhaps on the third day he would exclaim there it is and seizing his colours work rapidly till he had noted down the peculiar effect he wished to fix in his memory wreckers coast of northumberland painted ca  yale center for british art an engraving of a sketch by turner depicting brougham castle

and shipped the  atmospheric seascape staffa fingals cave worried about the paintings reception by lenox who knew turners work only through etchings leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa a most poetic picture of a steam boat would become apparent in time on receiving the painting lenox was baffled and greatly disappointed by what he called the paintings indistinctness when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner turner said you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte staffa fingals cave is now owned by the yale center for british art materialsedit turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments using several within a few years of their dates of discovery turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings despite knowing that they were not longlasting and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments as a result many of his colours have now faded john ruskin complained at how quickly turners work decayed turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied by  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading legacyedit turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works his will was contested and in  after a court battle his first cousins including thomas price turner received part of his fortune another portion went to the royal academy of arts which occasionally awards students the turner medal his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site and the parsimony of british governments twentytwo years after his death the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in  the main part of the turner bequest which includes unfinished paintings and drawings was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art now tate britain in  a new wing at the tate the clore gallery was opened to house the turner bequest though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turners condition that they be kept and shown together increasingly paintings are lent abroad ignoring turners provision that they be kept constantly in turners gallery after the turner content was diminished and diluted in the clore gallery from c  in – only two of the nine rooms on the main floor were devoted to turner the claim that the tate was fulfilling turners wishes was dropped in  when the charity commission said that the turner bequest had been free of turners conditions this was challenged by leolin price qccitation needed st marys church

biographyedit early lifeedit the house in maiden lane where turner was born cs joseph mallord william turner was born on  april  and baptised on  mayc he was born in maiden lane covent garden in london england his father william turner – september  was a barber and wig maker his mother mary marshall came from a family of butchers a younger sister mary ann was born in september  but died in august  drawing of st johns church margate by turner from around  when he would have been  or  years old the ambitious but unsure drawing shows an early struggle with perspective which can be contrasted with his later work a view of the archbishops palace lambeth – this watercolour was turners first to be accepted for the royal academys annual exhibition in april  the month he turned  the image is a technical presentation of turners strong grasp of the elements of perspective with several buildings at sharp angles to each other demonstrating turners thorough mastery of thomas maltons topographical style fishermen at sea exhibited in  was the first oil painting exhibited by turner at the royal academy modern rome – campo vaccino bonneville savoy  dallas museum of art oil on canvas  x  cm in  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st lukes hospital for lunatics in old street in  and then bethlem hospital in  where she died in  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle joseph mallord william marshall in brentford then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswells picturesque view of the antiquities of england and wales around  turner was sent to margate on the northeast kent coast here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work turner returned to margate many times in later life by this time turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that my son sir is going to be a painter in  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire now part of oxfordshire a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford the use of pencil sketches on location as the foundation for later finished paintings formed the basis of turners essential working style for his whole career many early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective and it is known that as a young man he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick james wyatt and joseph bonomi the elder by the end of  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton specialised in london views turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys he would later call malton my real master topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies royal academyedit in the same year of  he entered the royal academy of art schools at the age of  and was accepted into the academy a year later sir joshua reynolds president of the royal academy chaired the panel that admitted him at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishops palace lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of  when turner was  as a probationer in the academy he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures from july  to october  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times in june  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain particularly to wales where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours these particularly focused on architectural work which utilised his skills as a draughtsman in  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincents rock bristol now lost which foreshadowed his later climatic effects cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipiditiesand evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated in  turner exhibited fishermen at sea his first oil painting at the academy of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermens lantern wilton said that the image is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the th century and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet philip james de loutherbourg peter monamy and francis swaine who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter some later work however was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes early careeredit turner travelled widely in europe starting with france and switzerland in  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year he made many visits to venice on a visit to lyme regis in dorset he painted a stormy scene now in the cincinnati art museum important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes of farnley hall near otley in yorkshire who became a close friend of the artist turner first visited otley in  aged  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george obrien wyndham rd earl of egremont at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside including a view of the chichester canal petworth house still displays a number of paintings personal lifeedit as turner grew older he became more eccentric he had few close friends except for his father who lived with him for  years and worked as his studio assistant his fathers death in  had a profound effect on him and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression he never married but had a relationship with an older widow sarah danby he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in  and  later he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died living for about  years as mr booth in her house in chelsea like many of the day turner was a habitual user of snuff in  the king of france louisphilippe presented a gold snuff box to him of two other snuffboxes an agate and silver example bears turners name and another made of wood was collected along with his spectacles magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper deathedit turner died of cholera in the house of his lover sophia caroline booth in cheyne walk in chelsea on  december  and is said to have uttered the last words the sun is god though this may be apocryphal at his request he was buried in st pauls cathedral where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his last exhibition at the royal academy was in  turners friend architect philip hardwick – son of his tutor thomas hardwick was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that i must inform you we have lost him other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral henry harpur iv benefactor of westminster – now chelsea  westminster – hospital revd henry scott trimmer george jones ra and charles turner ara artedit dutch boats in a gale  joseph mallord william turner dutch fishing boats in a storm or a rising gale  willem van de velde the younger for his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the younger styleedit one of turners most successful house portraits raby castle the seat of the earl of darlington the walters art museum turners talent was recognised early in his life financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint according to david pipers the illustrated history of art his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles turner was recognised as an artistic genius influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of nature suitable vehicles for turners imagination were found in shipwrecks fires such as the burning of parliament in  an event which turner rushed to witness firsthand and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea as seen in dawn after the wreck  and the slave ship  snow storm steamboat off a harbours mouth  turners major venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum book of studies seventy prints that he worked on from  to  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art the idea was loosely based on claude lorrains liber veritatis book of truth where claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings by then at devonshire house had been a huge publishing success turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated and categorised the genre into six types marine mountainous pastoral historical architectural and elevated or epic pastoral his printmaking was a major part of his output and a museum is devoted to it the turner museum in sarasota florida founded in  by douglass montrosegraem to house his collection of turner prints turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merrymaking or working in the foreground but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the sublime nature of the world on the other sublime here means aweinspiring savage grandeur a natural world unmastered by man evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period to turner light was the emanation of gods spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail concentrating on the play of light on water the radiance of skies and fires although these late paintings appear to be impressionistic and therefore a forerunner of the french school turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world rather than responding primarily to optical phenomenacitation needed rain steam and speed – the great western railway painted  his early works such as tintern abbey  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape however in hannibal crossing the alps  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play his distinctive style of painting in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints created lightness fluency and ephemeral atmospheric effects in his later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain steam and speed – the great western railway where the objects are barely recognisable the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turners work in the vanguard of english painting but exerted an influence on art in france the impressionists particularly claude monet carefully studied his techniques chichester canals vivid colours may have been influenced by the eruption of mount tambora in  high levels of volcanic ash from the eruption of mt tambora in the atmosphere during  the year without a summer led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period and were an inspiration for some of turners work john ruskin says in his notes on turner in march  that an early patron dr thomas monro the principal physician of bedlam and also a collector and amateur artist was a significant influence on turners style his true master was dr monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself it is impossible to overestimate together with a number of young artists turner was able in the london house of dr monro to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens some of which were present in monros house went far further than the neat renderings of topography the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe circa  he met the irish physician robert james graves graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in sat beside him and soon took from his pocket a notebook across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning graves wondered if the man was insane he looked saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist the two travelled and sketched together for months graves tells that turner would outline a scene sit doing nothing for two or three days then suddenly perhaps on the third day he would exclaim there it is and seizing his colours work rapidly till he had noted down the peculiar effect he wished to fix in his memory wreckers coast of northumberland painted ca  yale center for british art an engraving of a sketch by turner depicting brougham castle

the wreck of a transport ship c  oil on canvas calais pier a study in oil of dolbadarn castle in wales – the first american to buy a turner painting was james lenox of new york city a private collector lenox wished to own a turner and in  bought one unseen through an intermediary his friend c r leslie from among the paintings turner had on hand and was willing to sell for £ leslie selected and shipped the  atmospheric seascape staffa fingals cave worried about the paintings reception by lenox who knew turners work only through etchings leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa a most poetic picture of a steam boat would become apparent in time on receiving the painting lenox was baffled and greatly disappointed by what he called the paintings indistinctness when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner turner said you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte staffa fingals cave is now owned by the yale center for british art materialsedit turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments using several within a few years of their dates of discovery turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings despite knowing that they were not longlasting and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments as a result many of his colours have now faded john ruskin complained at how quickly turners work decayed turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied by  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading legacyedit turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works his will was contested and in  after a court battle his first cousins including thomas price turner received part of his fortune another portion went to the royal academy of arts which occasionally awards students the turner medal his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site and the parsimony of british governments twentytwo years after his death the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in  the main part of the turner bequest which includes unfinished paintings and drawings was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art now tate britain in  a new wing at the tate the clore gallery was opened to house the turner bequest though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turners condition that they be kept and shown together increasingly paintings are lent abroad ignoring turners provision that they be kept constantly in turners gallery after the turner content was diminished and diluted in the clore gallery from c  in – only two of the nine rooms on the main floor were devoted to turner the claim that the tate was fulfilling turners wishes was dropped in  when the charity commission said that the turner bequest had been free of turners conditions this was challenged by leolin price qccitation needed st marys church

date of  april which is both saint georges day and the supposed birthday of william shakespeare was the date turner himself claimed to have been born but this claim has never been verified the first verifiable date is that turner was baptised on  may this casts some doubt on  april date as high infant mortality rates meant parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth c mary

london england his father william turner – september  was a barber and wig maker his mother mary marshall came from a family of butchers a younger sister mary ann was born in september  but died in august  drawing of st johns church margate by turner from around  when he would have been  or  years old the ambitious but unsure drawing shows an early struggle with perspective which can be contrasted with his later work a view of the archbishops palace lambeth – this watercolour was turners first to be accepted for the royal academys annual exhibition in april  the month he turned  the image is a technical presentation of turners strong grasp of the elements of perspective with several buildings at sharp angles to each other demonstrating turners thorough mastery of thomas maltons topographical style fishermen at sea exhibited in  was the first oil painting exhibited by turner at the royal academy modern rome – campo vaccino bonneville savoy  dallas museum of art oil on canvas  x  cm in  due to his mother showing signs of the mental disturbance for which she was admitted first to st lukes hospital for lunatics in old street in  and then bethlem hospital in  where she died in  the young turner was sent to stay with his maternal uncle joseph mallord william marshall in brentford then a small town on the banks of the river thames west of london the earliest known artistic exercise by turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from henry boswells picturesque view of the antiquities of england and wales around  turner was sent to margate on the northeast kent coast here he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area foreshadowing his later work turner returned to margate many times in later life by this time turners drawings were being exhibited in his fathers shop window and sold for a few shillings his father boasted to the artist thomas stothard that my son sir is going to be a painter in  turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to sunningwell in berkshire now part of oxfordshire a whole sketchbook of work from this time in berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of oxford the use of pencil sketches on location as the foundation for later finished paintings formed the basis of turners essential working style for his whole career many early sketches by turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective and it is known that as a young man he worked for several architects including thomas hardwick james wyatt and joseph bonomi the elder by the end of  he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman thomas malton specialised in london views turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade copying and colouring outline prints of british castles and abbeys he would later call malton my real master topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies royal academyedit in the same year of  he entered the royal academy of art schools at the age of  and was accepted into the academy a year later sir joshua reynolds president of the royal academy chaired the panel that admitted him at first turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised by the architect thomas hardwick to continue painting his first watercolour painting a view of the archbishops palace lambeth was accepted for the royal academy summer exhibition of  when turner was  as a probationer in the academy he was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures from july  to october  his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times in june  he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout britain particularly to wales where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours these particularly focused on architectural work which utilised his skills as a draughtsman in  he showed the watercolour titled the rising squall – hot wells from st vincents rock bristol now lost which foreshadowed his later climatic effects cunningham in his obituary of turner wrote that it was recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipiditiesand evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated in  turner exhibited fishermen at sea his first oil painting at the academy of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the needles off the isle of wight the image of boats in peril contrasts the cold light of the moon with the firelight glow of the fishermens lantern wilton said that the image is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the th century and shows strong influence by artists such as claude joseph vernet philip james de loutherbourg peter monamy and francis swaine who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings this particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of willem van de velde the younger as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter some later work however was created to rival or complement the manner of the dutch artist the image was praised by contemporary critics and founded turners reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes early careeredit turner travelled widely in europe starting with france and switzerland in  and studying in the louvre in paris in the same year he made many visits to venice on a visit to lyme regis in dorset he painted a stormy scene now in the cincinnati art museum important support for his work came from walter ramsden fawkes of farnley hall near otley in yorkshire who became a close friend of the artist turner first visited otley in  aged  when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area he was so attracted to otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career the stormy backdrop of hannibal crossing the alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the chevin in otley while he was staying at farnley hall turner was a frequent guest of george obrien wyndham rd earl of egremont at petworth house in west sussex and painted scenes that egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the sussex countryside including a view of the chichester canal petworth house still displays a number of paintings personal lifeedit as turner grew older he became more eccentric he had few close friends except for his father who lived with him for  years and worked as his studio assistant his fathers death in  had a profound effect on him and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression he never married but had a relationship with an older widow sarah danby he is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in  and  later he had a relationship with sophia caroline booth after her second husband died living for about  years as mr booth in her house in chelsea like many of the day turner was a habitual user of snuff in  the king of france louisphilippe presented a gold snuff box to him of two other snuffboxes an agate and silver example bears turners name and another made of wood was collected along with his spectacles magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper deathedit turner died of cholera in the house of his lover sophia caroline booth in cheyne walk in chelsea on  december  and is said to have uttered the last words the sun is god though this may be apocryphal at his request he was buried in st pauls cathedral where he lies next to sir joshua reynolds his last exhibition at the royal academy was in  turners friend architect philip hardwick – son of his tutor thomas hardwick was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew turner to tell them at the time of his death that i must inform you we have lost him other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral henry harpur iv benefactor of westminster – now chelsea  westminster – hospital revd henry scott trimmer george jones ra and charles turner ara artedit dutch boats in a gale  joseph mallord william turner dutch fishing boats in a storm or a rising gale  willem van de velde the younger for his painting turner drew inspiration from the art of willem van de velde the younger styleedit one of turners most successful house portraits raby castle the seat of the earl of darlington the walters art museum turners talent was recognised early in his life financial independence allowed turner to innovate freely his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint according to david pipers the illustrated history of art his later pictures were called fantastic puzzles turner was recognised as an artistic genius influential english art critic john ruskin described him as the artist who could most stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of nature suitable vehicles for turners imagination were found in shipwrecks fires such as the burning of parliament in  an event which turner rushed to witness firsthand and which he transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches natural catastrophes and natural phenomena such as sunlight storm rain and fog he was fascinated by the violent power of the sea as seen in dawn after the wreck  and the slave ship  snow storm steamboat off a harbours mouth  turners major venture into printmaking was the liber studiorum book of studies seventy prints that he worked on from  to  the liber studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art the idea was loosely based on claude lorrains liber veritatis book of truth where claude had recorded his completed paintings a series of print copies of these drawings by then at devonshire house had been a huge publishing success turners plates were meant to be widely disseminated and categorised the genre into six types marine mountainous pastoral historical architectural and elevated or epic pastoral his printmaking was a major part of his output and a museum is devoted to it the turner museum in sarasota florida founded in  by douglass montrosegraem to house his collection of turner prints turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merrymaking or working in the foreground but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the sublime nature of the world on the other sublime here means aweinspiring savage grandeur a natural world unmastered by man evidence of the power of god – a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period to turner light was the emanation of gods spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail concentrating on the play of light on water the radiance of skies and fires although these late paintings appear to be impressionistic and therefore a forerunner of the french school turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world rather than responding primarily to optical phenomenacitation needed rain steam and speed – the great western railway painted  his early works such as tintern abbey  stayed true to the traditions of english landscape however in hannibal crossing the alps  an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play his distinctive style of painting in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints created lightness fluency and ephemeral atmospheric effects in his later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour a prime example of his mature style can be seen in rain steam and speed – the great western railway where the objects are barely recognisable the intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed turners work in the vanguard of english painting but exerted an influence on art in france the impressionists particularly claude monet carefully studied his techniques chichester canals vivid colours may have been influenced by the eruption of mount tambora in  high levels of volcanic ash from the eruption of mt tambora in the atmosphere during  the year without a summer led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period and were an inspiration for some of turners work john ruskin says in his notes on turner in march  that an early patron dr thomas monro the principal physician of bedlam and also a collector and amateur artist was a significant influence on turners style his true master was dr monro to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend girtin the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed the greatness of the power itself it is impossible to overestimate together with a number of young artists turner was able in the london house of dr monro to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing but the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of john robert cozens some of which were present in monros house went far further than the neat renderings of topography the solemn grandeur of his alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium conveying mood instead of information on a trip to europe circa  he met the irish physician robert james graves graves was travelling in a diligence in the alps when a man who looked like the mate of a ship got in sat beside him and soon took from his pocket a notebook across which his hand from time to time passed with the rapidity of lightning graves wondered if the man was insane he looked saw that the stranger had been noting the forms of clouds as they passed and that he was no common artist the two travelled and sketched together for months graves tells that turner would outline a scene sit doing nothing for two or three days then suddenly perhaps on the third day he would exclaim there it is and seizing his colours work rapidly till he had noted down the peculiar effect he wished to fix in his memory wreckers coast of northumberland painted ca  yale center for british art an engraving of a sketch by turner depicting brougham castle

the wreck of a transport ship c  oil on canvas calais pier a study in oil of dolbadarn castle in wales – the first american to buy a turner painting was james lenox of new york city a private collector lenox wished to own a turner and in  bought one unseen through an intermediary his friend c r leslie from among the paintings turner had on hand and was willing to sell for £ leslie selected and shipped the  atmospheric seascape staffa fingals cave worried about the paintings reception by lenox who knew turners work only through etchings leslie wrote to lenox that the quality of staffa a most poetic picture of a steam boat would become apparent in time on receiving the painting lenox was baffled and greatly disappointed by what he called the paintings indistinctness when leslie was forced to relay this opinion to turner turner said you should tell mr lenox that indistinctness is my forte staffa fingals cave is now owned by the yale center for british art materialsedit turner used or experimented with a wide variety of pigments using several within a few years of their dates of discovery turner used pigments like carmine in his paintings despite knowing that they were not longlasting and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments as a result many of his colours have now faded john ruskin complained at how quickly turners work decayed turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied by  there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading legacyedit turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called decayed artists he planned and designed an almshouse for them at twickenham with a gallery for some of his works his will was contested and in  after a court battle his first cousins including thomas price turner received part of his fortune another portion went to the royal academy of arts which occasionally awards students the turner medal his collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the british nation and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them this did not happen because of a failure to agree on a site and the parsimony of british governments twentytwo years after his death the british parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside london and so began the process of scattering the pictures which turner had wanted to be kept together in  the main part of the turner bequest which includes unfinished paintings and drawings was rehoused in the duveen turner wing at the national gallery of british art now tate britain in  a new wing at the tate the clore gallery was opened to house the turner bequest though some of the most important paintings remain in the national gallery in contravention of turners condition that they be kept and shown together increasingly paintings are lent abroad ignoring turners provision that they be kept constantly in turners gallery after the turner content was diminished and diluted in the clore gallery from c  in – only two of the nine rooms on the main floor were devoted to turner the claim that the tate was fulfilling turners wishes was dropped in  when the charity commission said that the turner bequest had been free of turners conditions this was challenged by leolin price qccitation needed st marys church

date of  april which is both saint georges day and the supposed birthday of william shakespeare was the date turner himself claimed to have been born but this claim has never been verified the first verifiable date is that turner was baptised on  may this casts some doubt on  april date as high infant mortality rates meant parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth c mary

arbiter of taste was particularly hostile as aesthetically conservative as he was progressive in literary matters avidly promoting wordsworth’s poetry beaumont thought turner debased old masters like the seventeenthcentury landscape painter claude lorrain while turner resented beaumont’s enthusiasm for the young scottish painter david wilkie in  turner was upset when the prince regent did not buy a picture that he had apparently praised at an academy dinner thereby putting off other buyers who felt obliged to defer to royal interest running through the notes and drafts of verse that turner was now confiding to his sketchbooks there is a vein of bitterness at the vagaries of critics and patrons verging uncharacteristically on selfpityjoseph mallord william turner –lecture diagram  interior

controversy wary of the british institution founded in  which held rival exhibitions and in which beaumont and his friends were leading figures he exhibited there only rarely and in  in a manner evidently designed to undermine its ethos and governance despite earlier frictions he was fiercely loyal to the academy once referring to it as the ‘mother’ of artists in  he was appointed as its professor of perspective having proposed himself when the post proved hard to fill he was proud of the title sometimes adding ‘pp’ to ‘ra’ after his signature he began lecturing in  after prolonged research and preparation his poor delivery drew mixed reviews but his catholic approach to his brief ranging widely over history and theory and the illustrations he prepared for his lectures including one depicting the great room at the academy where they were delivered fig were praised he retained the post until  although he had not lectured for ten years he might have preferred to be professor of landscape a post he first suggested to the academy in  from  encouraged by an artist friend william wells he classified the history and practice of landscape art from mountainous to marine natural to ideal and his own dominance of all these aspects in a series of original prints the liber studiorum book of studies the title echoed claude’s graphic record of his work the liber veritatis and perhaps also a liber nauticus – by his former housemate serresthe lectures and the liber showed turner at his most didactic and with his gallery and other exhibited works demonstrated his extraordinary energy and determination to command the public sphere all this excluded much in the way of a private life and such as he had was closely tied to his work although it revealed a contrary need for seclusion which in later years mutated into secrecy or deliberate mystification from thamesside lodgings at sion syon ferry house isleworth – fig and upper mall hammersmith – he explored the river and pursued his favourite hobby fishing – characteristically a solitary one sketches of the thames in watercolour and oil exemplify the naturalism then emerging in british painting others transform it into an

conscious of the cultural history of the thames riverside the former home of poets and painters turner was disgusted at the demolition by a philistine baroness in  of alexander pope’s famous villa at twickenham – the subject of a picture and anguished outpourings of verse in  turner bought his own plot at twickenham where he designed and built a villa sandycombe sometimes ‘solus’ lodge fig in retreat there he was looked after by his devoted father who cooked and gardened his mother had died in  probably at bethlem and he had not married once remarking in a sketchbook that ‘woman is doubtful love’ for a few years he had been close to sarah danby the widow of a wellknown musician but inevitably they were often apart she bore two daughters evelina and georgiana who have been widely recognised as turner’s although a recent theory suggests that they were his father’s and thus his halfsisters hannah danby niece of sarah’s late husband was turner’s housekeeper at queen anne street

series of topographical subjects based on turner’s watercolours it was followed by surveys of rivers ports and harbours and the magisterial but unfinished picturesque views in england wales for charles heathpublished – although the last had to be abandoned as a commercial failure for many years these projects made significant contributions to his income and brought his work to a wider public as rich in memory and association as in depictions of contemporary life industry and leisure the prints reflected the nation to it itself and ensured that even today early nineteenthcentury britain is

distinguished visitors included in  the italian sculptor antonio canova who pronounced turner a great genius following a period of closure for improvements the gallery reopened in  thereafter evolving from a showcase of new work into a museum fig housing a representative collection from which the artist was reluctant to part or to which he added when possible by buying back pictures – for example at the sale of lord de tabley the former sir john leicester in  turner’s plans for his legacy including a gallery of his pictures at the new national gallery or attached to almshouses on his land at

on the continent on successive visits to france he explored the loire in  and seine from – a larger plan to portray the great rivers of europe was never realised but three volumes of prints were published by heath with letterpress by leitch ritchie as wandering by the loire and seine – marketed as ‘turner’s annual tour’ and later combined as rivers of francethey were pitched at new middle class readers who might expect to follow in the artist’s footsteps meanwhile in  turner had opened a seam of overtly literary topography visiting scotland to illustrate walter scott’s picturesque antiquities illustrations to scott’s poetry novels and life of napoleon byron the bankerpoet samuel rogers thomas campbell and thomas moore as well as john milton and the bible often designed as vignettes – a form turner made very much his own – followed in the coming years among living poets turner was fondest of byron’s writing borrowing more passages from childe harold as themes for pictures but he knew rogers and scott best with other luminaries of literary and artistic london he was pictured among the guests who frequented rogers’s celebrated breakfastparties in st james’s fig he visited scott at abbotsford and scott’s role as stagemanager of george iv’s visit to edinburgh in  was a factor in his attempt at a set of paintings recording the royal progress these were left

historical and classical subjects that save for their dazzling atmospherics were oldfashioned by the s he was also highly responsive to contemporary subjects especially those that marked a transition from the past in  he grasped at once the pictorial power and national symbolism of the burning of the old houses of parliament happening as it did just two years after the reform bill of  changed the political landscape he watched the blaze from a boat on the thames made a series of colour studies and the following spring sent a picture each to the royal academy and british institution surely sensing a warning from history for his native london more than any other painter he caught the postromantic allure of venice transforming itself from decaying trading metropolis to modern touristtrap

breaker’s yard into an elegy for the passing age of sail a picture william thackeray writing under his pseudonym of michael angelo titmarsh described as a ‘magnificent national ode or a piece of music’ no other artist was attempting such definitive renderings of the emergent modern world its moral preoccupations of slavery or machine labour and inventions of steamships and railways nor doing so with such panache and sense of theatre in famous performances at the academy varnishing days he took mysterious sketches into the rooms and brought order from chaos in front of his colleagues fig looking at the many watercolour studies and trials as well as studio oils from these years there can be little doubt that such staged public displays were fuelled by a compulsive private exploration

m w turner ra in  by louisphilippe of francephoto  the trustees of the british museumturner could no more escape controversy in this later period than when he first came to prominence in  a virulent review in blackwood’s magazine by the revd john eagles moved john ruskin – then only seventeen – tospring to turner’s defence at first wary of his enthusiasm turner advised ruskin not to publish it following correspondence they met in  at the house of turner’s agent thomas griffith and in  ruskin published the first volume of his book modern painters – placing turner at their head while critics accused turner of extravagance and exaggeration outdoing each other with comparisons of his pictures to lobster salad soapsuds and whitewash beetroot or mustard ruskin rooted his analysis at least at first in turner’s truth to nature he became the standardbearer of a new generation of turner admirers now usually professional middle class or newly rich who embraced his work for its modernity their enthusiasm for watercolours as well as oils brought an upsurge of work in the medium in the last decade of turner’s working life increasingly directed towards independent subjects and watercolour ‘pictures’ rather than the demands of engravers and publishers from  griffith was tasked to offer sample studies to clients to attract commissions reflecting the cosmopolitan european character of turner’s mature art as well as its most advanced techniques the subjects were mainly swiss arising from summer tours since  turner made his last visit to switzerland in  his health was failing and in  he could only manage two short trips to france on the second he dined with king louisphilippe whom he had known when the future king was in exile at twickenham and who had since presented him with a

had left funds for a grand funeral and a further legacy of £ for a monument a marble statue by patrick macdowell was erected in the nave of the cathedral in  the same year that the first biography by walter thornbury was published the statue is an imposing retrospect of a squat awkward figure that in life had usually resisted depiction between his early selfportrait and a death mask showing his face in extreme decay toothless and hollowcheeked fig images of turner were often made surreptitiously veering from affectionate to caricature along with countless contemporary anecdotes of varying reliability they convey the enigma of a man whose genius could hardly be denied but who looked like a sailor a farmer or in one particularly snobbish description no more like an artist than a ‘ganger’ or labourer his art however must be the key to a life of which many details remain elusive and arguably no completely convincing account has yet appeared a measured obituary in the times acknowledged both the criticism and admiration he had received but concluded that the best of his peers had ‘ever admitted to his superiority in poetry feeling fancy and genius’ and treated him with ‘that reverential respect and estimation which is given to other artists by posterity alone’ knowingly or not this echoed the reviewer who in  had placed turner among ‘the masters whose day is not so much
