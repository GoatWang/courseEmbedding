checker board games sold  pancakes served in  our story   rising above america’s interstate highways a familiar sign beckons  eggs break biscuits bake the smell of homestyle cooking rises  a cash register dings chairs rock checkers pass the time more than  years ago a tennessee man named dan evins saw an unmet need the american interstate was expanding—connecting people to new places—but travelers couldn’t count on a consistent quality place to stop along the way to stretch their legs refuel and find a good meal at a fair price evins had a vision to build an old country store to meet their needs—a place that preserved the ingredients of country life to share with travelers on the road and families from nearby    before evins knew it the idea was much bigger than him built by hard work a mission of pleasing people and strong values to do the right thing the cooks wait staff operators and evins’ uncle herschel mccartney—described as the “soul” of cracker barrel—created more than a respite they set an iconic american family table for generations to come fast forward to today and you’ll find that cracker barrel is a strong and growing business—grounded by a clear mission  our brand is about coming home to a simpler time and place but our business can’t be immune to a changing world it’s fair to say we’re striving to strike a thoughtful balance between preserving what makes us special and making changes that tomorrow’s guests will expect we are working to integrate technology into the restaurant experience while ensuring that cracker barrel remains a sanctuary from life’s routines we’re focusing on attracting a greater diversity of employees and guests of all ages—setting a place at our table for every family in america we are expanding the breadth of the merchandise in our stores—shaking up our seasonal displays nearly  times a year with a broader assortment of special finds to make sure there’s something for everyone—while keeping a special place for things like music on our shelves  and we are working to bring greater choice to our menu—whether it’s an interactive dining experience with our popular campfire meals or more wholesome fixin’s for an increasingly healthconscious america—while preserving the popular mainstays like chicken n’ dumplings at the core of who we are—and have been since the beginning—is our highquality homestyle food if we can’t source the highest quality ingredients for a menu item we simply don’t serve it we use blueberries from maine valencia oranges from florida for our freshsqueezed juice  natural syrup individually bottled in vermont westminster crackers from a yearold recipe and serve only choice quality steak our commitment to quality is complemented by a growing commitment to local ingredients and to keeping our menu fresh and exciting with seasonal choices  and in the products we sell we seek out trusted artisans and vendors to bring our guests the best quality for their dollar  but that’s what’s on the table and on the shelf  what keeps people coming through our doors year after year is something far deeper it’s a sense of human connection the connection to people—to family and friends around the table our very roots are all about connection as we began along the interstate which had the purpose of connecting people and places to us this sense of connection is our higher purpose and what our mission provides genuine southern hospitality pleasing people is our mission—and a powerful one while food may nourish the body we believe that our larger purpose is to nourish the soul
