letter to depomed shareholders starboard delivers special meeting request to depomed and issues letter to depomed shareholders sets november   as the date for the special meeting and believes depomed has notified broadridge of a september   record datereiterates steadfast belief that a new board is required at depomed to represent the best interests of shareholdersalso believes a new board is necessary to ensure shareholders best interests are paramount and value is maximized in any sale process for depomedoutlines continuity plan for expanding the board to add back up to three incumbent directors in addition to starboards two highly qualified advisors if successful in replacing the board at the special meeting news provided by starboard value lp sep    et share this article new york sept   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc depomed nasdaq depo with beneficial ownership of approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered an open letter to depomed shareholders  starboard also announced that as of this past friday it has delivered to depomed more than the required consents to call a special meeting of depomed shareholders and has set november   as the date for the special meeting  the full text of starboards letter to depomed shareholders follows september   dear fellow shareholders starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard and director nominees currently owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the board of directors the board to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders unfortunately a series of shareholderunfriendly actions by the board over the past two years have led us to conclude that management and the board are not acting in the best interest of all shareholders we therefore continue to believe it is necessary to make substantial changes to the composition of the board as soon as possible so that steps can be taken to create value for the benefit of all shareholders as you may recall we initiated the process to call a special meeting of shareholders the special meeting on april   and subsequently on july   announced that we would proceed with a consent solicitation to call the special meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under depomeds bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least  of depomeds outstanding shares entitled to vote as of friday we delivered to depomed more than the required consents and have therefore initiated the calling of the special meeting to be held on november    we continue to have significant concerns that depomeds board is not looking out for the best interests of shareholders  this was first evident during horizon pharma plcs horizon attempt to acquire the company and was then reaffirmed by the boards stealthy attempt to strip certain important shareholder rights earlier this year under the guise of a delaware reincorporation proposal  we have been steadfast that in light of these egregious actions the company clearly needs a new board to ensure that shareholders rights are properly and fully represented based on recent press reports it appears that depomed may have hired bankers to explore a sale  as we have outlined publicly we believe depomed would be extremely attractive to numerous potential acquirers and while there exists an opportunity to significantly improve operations at the company an outright sale may be the best option for unlocking shareholder value  however we remain extremely concerned that any potential sale process may not be undertaken with genuine intent but rather as a smokescreen to distract from the required board changes we are seeking and protect the current boards positions beyond the special meeting  we also do not trust the current board to steward any sale process given the lengths the board went to rebuff the approach by horizon in   following the boards mishandling of the horizon acquisition proposal it is imperative that any sale process be squarely focused on maximizing value for all shareholders  depomed refused to engage with horizon despite its  per share offer at a  premium and despite having expressed a willingness to raise the deal price according to a proxy filing made by horizon in november  horizon and its advisors reached out to depomed to attempt to engage in acquisition discussions on more than  different occasions and not once did depomed or its advisors meaningfully engage with horizon instead this board not only avoided horizon but also unilaterally amended the bylaws to make it extremely difficult for shareholders to have their voices heard on horizons offer sued horizon and adopted a poison pill is this the type of board you can trust to conduct a robust sale process to maximize the value of your investment unfortunately according to recent press reports the companys actions regarding horizon appear to be eerily similar to multiple other recent potential suitors who have reached out to try to engage with the company on numerous occasions only to be rebuffed  clearly the company has a history of refusing to engage with potential suitors and not acting in the best interests of shareholders  press reports state that the company has not yet begun a sale process but may do so in the future  we have little confidence that the company will begin a thorough and genuine process that includes all potential suitors in a manner designed to successfully maximize value for all shareholders  therefore we believe that it is necessary for directors proposed by starboard to be involved in any sale process at the board level to ensure that the board is actually and capably representing the best interests of shareholders and that value is maximized record datewe have been advised that depomed has notified broadridge financial solutions of a september   record date for the special meeting  it is crucial that shareholders take whatever steps may be needed with their custodial banks and brokerage firms to ensure that they have the ability to vote their shares at the special meeting it is important for shareholders to understand that while we firmly believe a change of the majority of the board is warranted we do not practically have any other option for seeking board composition changes at the special meeting but to seek the removal of the entire board  this is because certain provisions under california law and the companys bylaws make it extremely difficult if not virtually impossible to remove any fewer than all of the companys directors  effectively if shareholders were to vote against the removal of even just one depomed director at the special meeting then a directorprotecting cumulative voting provision is triggered with respect to every other director thereby making the voting threshold required to remove any directors extraordinarily high and virtually impracticable in light of these unfortunate technical factors combined with the serious governance and operational deficiencies at depomed we intend to vigorously pursue replacement of the entire board to ensure that depomed is being run in a manner consistent with the best interests of all shareholders  over the coming weeks leading up to the special meeting we will be sharing additional details on our concerns regarding the serious corporate governance issues questionable capital allocation decisions and actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed  we believe the board clearly lacks the independence objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of all shareholders as we progress towards the special meeting we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be elected as the new board of depomed including our highly qualified advisors who would be invited to join the new board if we are successful  we believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to depomeds business and current challenges including pharmaceutical operations healthcare regulatory finance board governance and oversight and mergers and acquisitions expertise  collectively our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards  importantly this group of nominees if elected at the special meeting together with our highly qualified advisors is prepared to serve the shareholders of depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance  we have provided summary biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below continuityin addition in order to maintain a degree of continuity on the new board in the event that the current board is removed and our nominees are elected at the special meeting the new board would be willing to increase the size of the board to eleven members and add back up to three incumbent directors  as a reminder we utilized this construct successfully at darden restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board members we look forward to sharing additional details on our plans for depomed and engaging with you over the coming weeks as we approach the special meeting  as one of the largest shareholders of the company our interests are directly aligned with yours  we firmly believe that our proposed changes are in the best interest of all shareholders    highlights of starboards nominees and advisors biographies in alphabetical order john j
