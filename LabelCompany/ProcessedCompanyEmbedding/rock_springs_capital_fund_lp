johnson unitedhealth group bristolmyers squibb about the fund kris jenner was a top mutual fund manager for years heading up t rowe prices health sciences fund since  that fund was the firms top performer over his year tenure according to an analysis by bloomberg but last year he struck out on his own and raised  million for hedge fund rock springs capital the strategy wont be dissimilar from health sciences which has fared just fine so far under the hand of taymour tamaddon and is up  this year and is worth  billion its difficult to sort rock springs performance from the new money thats likely continuing to flow inrock springs hasnt reported on its fundraising to the sec since it first did so on oct   kris jenner intellectually jenner is certainly no slouch he has an md and a phd from johns hopkins university and oxford university respectively he completed two years of a general surgery residency at johns hopkins jenner is likely to have a more even hand and a larger cap focus than another fund manager who struck out on his own also raising his own fund late last year alex denner the former biotech righthand man to investing superstar carl icahn denners strategy is to hold multiple separate pools of money that each allow him to focus on a particular investing strategy according to sec filings from last year denner raised about  million in an offshore fund and  million in a domestic fund already hes jumped in and raised an activist fuss at biotechs such as ariad aria and vivus vvus like his mentor icahn who is rumored to be an investor in denners fund but given the additional tools at jenners disposal such as shorting stocks to hedge his bets its likely that the influential jenner will get his fund performance in hand shortly but it remains to be seen if the time sitting on the sidelines during fundraising and ramping upduring a very hot market for biotechwill make it more difficult to find wellpriced investments show me the money one of jenners largest
