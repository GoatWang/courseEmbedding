been terminated and replaced by the trust the  notes are guaranteed the �guarantee� as to timely payment of principal and interest by the united states government �us government� acting through the administrator of rus the general counsel of the united states department of agriculture has issued an opinion that the guarantee is supported by the full faith and credit of the us government the trust issued certificates of beneficial interests the �series  certificates� that bear interest at a variable rate and mature in  the trust will commence winding up upon the maturity of the  notes and series  certificates which both mature in  the trust has no mandatory liquidation date however the servicer of the trust expects to liquidate remaining assets in the ordinary course of business shortly after maturity of the  notes and series  certificatesswap agreementthe trust also holds certain rights the cooperative assigned to the trust under an interest rate swap agreement the �swap agreement� the swap agreement was entered into to hedge the interest rate exposure associated with the fixedrate  notes and a variablerate obligation the counterparty to the swap agreement is jpmorgan chase  co �jpmorgan chase� pursuant to the swap agreement the trust pays to jpmorgan chase a fixed rate of interest on the outstanding notional amount and jpmorgan chase pays the trust a variable rate of interest on the outstanding notional amount the structure is designed such that the interest amounts paid by the cooperative to the trust are the same amounts paid to jpmorgan chase pursuant to the swap agreement plus the amounts payable to cfc as servicer the amounts paid by jpmorgan chase to the trust under the swap agreement are the same as the interest payable by the trust to the holders of the series  certificatesthe initial notional amount of the swap agreement which is not included on the trust�s balance sheet was  the notional amount of the swap agreement decreases over time in an amount such that the outstanding notional amount is always equal to the outstanding balance of the  notes and the series  certificates the swap agreement terminates on december   but is subject to

the servicers knowledge event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of servicing termination has occurred or is continuingtax status of the trustthe trust is a passthrough

and use of estimatesthe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us �us gaap� the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the trust�s servicer to make estimates and assumptions with respect to among other things various future factors which are difficult to predict and are beyond the control of the trust these estimates which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures areas in which estimates have been made include but are not limited to the fair value of derivative financial instruments while the trust�s servicer makes its best judgment actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates notes receivablethe trust accounts for the notes receivable based on historical cost no allowance for loan losses has been recorded because the timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the us government interest income is recognized on the notes as earned on an accrual basis grantor trust certificatesthe trust recognizes interest expense on

instruments and hedging activitiesthe trust is neither a dealer nor a trader in derivative financial instruments the trust entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its interest rate risk exposure related to the  notes derivatives are reported at fair value on the balance sheets derivatives in a gain position are recorded as a derivative asset while derivatives in a loss position are reported as a derivative liability changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded as a component of derivative gain loss in the statements of comprehensive income the trust did not have any derivatives in hedge accounting relationships at december   or  the trust recorded a cumulative derivative transition gain of  in accumulated other comprehensive income �aoci� at january   as a result of the adoption of the derivative accounting guidance that required derivatives to be reported at fair value on the balance sheets the transition adjustment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the interest rate swap derivative prior to the january   adoption of the derivative accounting guidance and its fair value at the date of initial adoption the transition gain is being

between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price the fair value accounting guidance provides a threelevel fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable fair value measurement of an asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities��level observable marketbased inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities��level unobservable inputsthe accounting guidance for fair value requires maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value fair value of

as a liability measured at fair value the swap agreement is subject to a master netting agreement pursuant to the isda there is not an active secondary market for this type of interest rate swap to calculate fair value a forward interest rate curve is used to determine the projected floating rate cash flows and the discount factors needed to calculate the net present value of each interest

market swap rates independent validation procedures are used to corroborate the fair value measures obtained from the derivative counterparty this valuation technique is classified as level  assets
