loginregister contact us advertise njbiz health care  pharma making her mark bonstein finds advaxis satisfies her desire to work in finance while working for a better world by daria meoli february   at  am “speaking up and sharing ideas is what gets you recognized and allows you to continue to grow”  sara bonstein cfo of advaxis immunotherapies  photo by aaron houston sara bonstein is the senior vice president and chief financial officer of advaxis immunotherapies a princetonbased clinicalstage biotechnology company working to develop cancer immunotherapy treatments prior to taking the role in  bonstein held several finance positions in the health care industry working for eli lilly  co imclone systems and johnson  johnson bonstein recently spoke with njbiz about how her ambition to sit in the csuite was never tempered by being a woman in a maledominated role name sara bonstein age  hometown newtown pa hidden talent baking career i’d pursue outside of finance own a gym or be a fitness instructor njbiz did you always aspire to the role of cfo sara bonstein at my first job out of undergrad i had a conversation with one of my first supervisors about wanting to be a cfo and asked what i needed to do to get there this was always an aspiration of mine even at the earliest junctures of my career i wanted to position myself for success njbiz what skills or qualities do you believe helped you ascend to the csuite sb from the time i started my career i wasn’t afraid to speak my mind and challenge people in an appropriate and respectful manner i didn’t say yes just to say yes speaking up and sharing ideas is what gets you recognized and allows you to continue to grow it helps you create roles within an organization that may not have existed before you challenged a specific activity i also think being respectful to everyone throughout your professional career is really important from the time you walk in the door as an entrylevel person and as you grow to take on increasing responsibility and new titles giving the same respect to everyone regardless of their position or function is critical the industry is very wellconnected and giving respect goes a long way njbiz as cfo how do you help to shape the overall strategy of the company sb i see finance as a partner of every single role within the organization right wrong or indifferent everything costs money finance touches every function there is a fine line that finance executives have to walk between their core finance functions and operational functions a cfo can’t be responsible for everyone’s spending but coworkers in other functions are not financial experts that is why the cfo is there it’s my role to help the other executives understand the roi the net present value the probabilities and the potential tradeoffs of the strategic decisions they want to make njbiz how did you end up with a finance career in the health care industry still a boys’ clubwhile several of the female cfos interviewed this week said they did not believe their gender impacted their career trajectory recent studies show there is still a dearth of women executives in the top finance positions at major companiesaccording to a study of the standard  poor’s  published by the harvard business review females make up only  percent of the cfos at these companiesthis despite the fact women make up  percent of the total finance industry labor force catalyst the nonprofit research organization recently reported that as of february  there were only  women cfos among all of the fortune  companies sb i worked at merrill lynch briefly while i was in college i wanted to try the banking industry but i felt it wasn’t for me the pharma industry is really where i wanted to be so i went to johnson  johnson and i have been on the oncology side of the business for most of my career i give people who work in more traditional finance industries and banking a lot of credit but i wanted to work in an industry that helps people live longer and have betterquality lives with their families and loved ones i am not a scientist by any means so this is a way i can give back using my skillset njbiz what trends happening in the biotech pharma industry are having an impact on your role sb payer reimbursement is going to be a big thing from my point of view companies with products in infancy stages such as preclinical phase one need to think about what the pricing and reimbursement strategy is going to be you can have the best product but if you can’t get reimbursement for it you are going to have a hard time companies recognizing these constraints during the development phase can get creative with their development plans their manufacturing methods and their pricing strategy njbiz what are some of the challenges you face as a cfo in health care sb we are continuously challenged to do more with less we have to figure out how to work with fewer resources how to do things faster and how to do a broader scope of activities with the same or fewer resources in the same or less time while working at eli lilly i had the opportunity to take on a six sigma role i took a lot out of the experience and applied it to my future roles it is really important that we look through our everyday tasks to eliminate waste and redundancies we have to challenge the norm in order to be successful at doing more with less efficiency is especially important in the pharma industry the longer we take to develop medicines the longer patients have to wait to get the medicine they need to live a stronger healthier life you have to be smart about how you are doing your work are you doing work just to be busy or are you creating good output another challenge a lot of cfos face today is that we are being asked to go beyond the traditional accounting role today we are asked to function as a chief administrative officer in several ways i have overarching responsibilities in human resources it legal and facilities as a finance professional these areas were out of my comfort zone i had to be able to rely on my team and be open to learning from them njbiz do you face any particular challenges as a woman cfo sb maybe it is due to the way my parents raised me but i never felt that gender was a roadblock in my life i always felt hard work and determination are what yield success we all know that finance is a maledominated field but as long as you have confidence in your abilities work hard and show impactful contributions to your organization you’ll succeed as an individual regardless of gender today i’m a wife and a mom of two kids most working parents — not just women but men too — will probably say that life is a constant balancing act i am triple and quadrupletasking all the time but i wouldn’t change that it is what keeps me fueled and energized i will say that while our society has come really far with equal rights for women there is that stereotype of what the traditional mom role is i don’t have all the answers as far as how to fill that role but open communication with your spouse your kids and your coworkers helps you get through each day njbiz how does having open communication with coworkers about your role as a mom help you sb i try to meet with my team every week or every other week and i’m really open with them i’ll tell them when my husband is going to be traveling or i have other things come up at home and it’s a twoway communication so we can develop twoway respect for the balance we are all trying to find in our lives email to dariamnjbizcomon
