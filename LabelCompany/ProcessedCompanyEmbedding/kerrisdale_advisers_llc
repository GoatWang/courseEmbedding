technology capable of producing bandwidth economics competitors can’t match for the sliver of revenue generated from delivering broadband to an airplane that may be true for the  of ebitda that comes from delivering broadband to homes and small businesses it is not viasat provides inferior technology in a hypercompetitive market the company’s main business is selling satellitebased basic home internet service to us consumers unfortunately its technology is no match for terrestrial internet providers today let alone over the next few years as terrestrial competitors dramatically increase speed capacity and coverage through rapid technological advancements for viasat forced to compete against terrestrial by launching satellites that exhaust capacity in year cycles us residential broadband is a terrible business destined to fail longs believe viasat is insulated from robust competition by its focus on rural households they believe viasat should thrive in a large addressable market of underserved homes using leading satellite technology to take share against legacy telco and cable operators once viasat is operational subscriber trends will meaningfully improve – that’s when a stock stuck in neutral for nearly  years will finally lift off every part of this bull thesis is critically flawed based on both speed and capacity the company’s value proposition has lost every shred of commercial viability since its last satellite launch sellside estimates that call for a tripling of gross subscriber additions stable churn customer disconnects rising margins and continued inflated arpu growth are wildly unrealistic investors underappreciate the magnitude and timing of technology improvements in competing terrestrial networks that directly impact viasat’s target market vdsl gfast docsis  and fiber rollouts are dramatically improving the capability and coverage of landline networks wireless g lte is ubiquitous unlimited data plans are offered by all four major carriers and massive increases in spectral efficiency are fueling exponential gains in mobile speed and capacity the changes in technology are not science fiction nor progressing slowly over many years the competitive advantage that drove viasat’s subscriber performance with the launch of viasat five years ago no longer exists viasat will not drive substantial subscriber growth and viasat will have stranded capacity satellite consumer home internet – like pagers blackberries pay phones and vhs players – will soon become nearly extinct in the united states a tiny footnote in the technological landscape with products owned by a negligible fraction of households like many technology businesses facing nearterm obsolescence viasat uses noncore products and misleading reporting metrics to disguise its doomed principal business  one particular aggressive tactic has been to use classic telecom gimmicks to inflate average revenue per user arpu for the past  years viasat has been jamming customers with commoditized addons like voip for mo “priority access” customer support for mo and antivirus for mo these temporary arpu contributions will erode under competitive pressure just like charging for caller id voicemail and callwaiting did for legacy wireline carriers arpu forecasts across the street do not properly account for the high level of nonbandwidth revenues that are unsustainable in a competitive environment when arpu inevitably declines so will ebitda estimates and dcfdriven price targets to add insult to injury while viasat waits  more months for its next satellite to be operational echostar’s new jupiter  is in the market now poaching the few final adopters of satellite home internet viasat is currently slashing prices to avoid losing a tenth of its customers before the end of the year amid this deteriorating competitive position the company is burning cash and tapping the capital markets for external funding since becoming a satellite services company viasat has never generated positive free cash flow the last time the company needed funding it sold m of equity  dilutive at a price near current trading levels viasat needs the capital markets for another bn of capital over the next few years which it will then invest in a business – satellite consumer home broadband – that will have mostly disappeared in the united states within  to  years  the company withholds disclosures required to accurately assess the health of the consumer broadband business downplays the unit’s eroding competitiveness and inflates metrics used in valuation all to retain necessary access to the capital markets viasat is not an innovative company taking share from legacy telco – it is legacy telco subscriber metrics will woefully underperform expectations and it won’t be long until the market realizes that satellitebased residential internet is a business in terminal secular decline we place fair value at  or  downside read the full report
