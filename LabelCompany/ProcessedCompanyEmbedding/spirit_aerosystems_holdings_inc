appendix management believes that the nongaap generally accepted accounting principles measures indicated by  used in this report provide investors with important perspectives into the companys ongoing business performance the company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures other companies may define the measures differently free cash flow is defined as gaap net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property plant and equipment additions management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders debt repayment and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity management considers special items which may include termination charges settlement charges and other items that arise from time to time to be outside the ordinary course of our operations management believes that excluding these items provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the companys operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the companys operating results to historical performance the tables below provide reconciliations between the gaap and
