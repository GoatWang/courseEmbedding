world bank group the world bank group  international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd photo by norebbo background as early as february  united states undersecretary of state sumner b welles urged preparatory consultation aimed at the establishment of agencies to finance reconstruction and development of the world economy after wwii the us and the uk took leading roles in the negotiations that were to result in the formation of the ibrd and the imf the ibrd is the main lending organization of the world bank group and like its sister institution the international monetary fund imf was born of the allies realization during world war ii that tremendous difficulties in reconstruction and development would face them in the postwar transition period necessitating international economic and financial cooperation on a vast scale the ibrd frequently called the world bank was conceived in july  at the united nations monetary and financial conference in bretton woods new hampshire us purposes although one of the banks early functions was to assist in bringing about a smooth transition from wartime to peaceful economies economic development soon became the banks main object today the goal of the world bank is to promote economic development that benefits poor people in developing countries loans are provided to developing countries to help reduce poverty and to finance investments that contribute to economic growth investments include roads power plants schools and irrigation networks as well as activities like agricultural extension services training for teachers and nutritionimprovement programs for children and pregnant women some world bank loans finance changes in the structure of countries economies to make them more stable efficient and market oriented the world bank also provides technical assistance to help governments make specific sectors of their economies more efficient and more relevant to national development goals membership the banks founders envisioned a global institution the membership of which would eventually comprise all nations membership in the ibrd rose gradually from  governments in  to  as of july  a government may withdraw from membership at any time by giving notice of withdrawal membership also ceases for a member suspended by a majority of the governors for failure to fulfill an obligation if that member has not been restored to good standing by a similar majority within a year after the suspension only a few countries have withdrawn their membership from the bank and all but cuba withdrew in  have rejoined although the soviet union took part in the  bretton woods conference and signed the final act establishing the imf and the ibrd it never ratified the articles of agreement or paid in the  of its subscribed capital that was due within  days after the bank began operations had it joined the soviet union would have been the banks third largest shareholder after the united states and the united kingdom over the next four decades as the bank grew in size and scope it couldnt fulfill its founders intentions of being a truly global institution due to the absence of the soviet union then at the beginning of the s as political and economic change swept through the  republics of the ussr the soviet government indicated its interest in participating in the international financial system and sought membership in the imf and world bank on  july  soviet president mikhail gorbachev formally applied for membership for the ussr in the ibrd and its three affiliates ifc ida and miga however by december  the ussr had ceased to exist during  the russian federation and  former soviet republics including the baltic states applied for membership and were accepted eleven of them also applied to ida  to ifc and  to miga to accommodate these countries the total authorized capital of the bank was increased a graduating country is one where lending is being phased out as of  there were  countries that had graduated from the ibrd these include with the fiscal year of their final loan france  luxembourg  netherlands  belgium  australia  austria  denmark  malta  norway  italy  japan  new zealand  iraq  iceland  finland  israel  singapore  ireland  spain  greece  oman  bahamas  portugal  cyprus  barbados  the republic of korea  and china  structure board of governors all powers of the bank are vested in its board of governors composed of one governor and one alternate from each member state ministers of finance central bank presidents or persons of comparable status usually represent member states on the banks board of governors the board meets annually the bank is organized somewhat like a corporation according to an agreedupon formula member countries subscribe to shares of the banks capital stock each governor is entitled to cast  votes plus  vote for each share of capital stock subscribed by his country executive directors the banks board of governors has delegated most of its authority to  executive directors according to the articles of agreement each of the five largest shareholders—the united states japan germany france and the united kingdom—appoints one executive director the other countries are grouped in  constituencies each represented by an executive director who is elected by a group of countries the number of countries each of these  directors represents varies widely for example the executive directors for china the russian federation and saudi arabia represent one country each while one director speaks for  francophone african countries and another director represents  mainly englishspeaking african countries president and staff the president of the bank elected by the executive directors is also their chairman although he is not entitled to a vote except in case of an equal division subject to their general direction the president is responsible for the conduct of the ordinary business of the bank action on bank loans is initiated by the president and the staff of the bank the amount terms and conditions of a loan are recommended by the president to the executive directors and the loan is made if his recommendation is approved by them according to an informal agreement the president of the bank is a us national and the managing director of the imf is a european the presidents initial term is for five years a second term can be five years or less past presidents of the bank include robert s mcnamara – a w clausen – barber b conable – and lewis t preston – james d wolfensohn became president on  june  on september   mr wolfensohn was unanimously reappointed by the banks board of executive directors to a second fiveyear term as president beginning june   he is the third president in world bank history to serve a second term he heads a staff of more than  persons from over  countries the ibrds headquarters are at  h street nw washington dc  budget a total administrative budget of us  million was approved for fiscal year  activities a financial resources authorized capital at its establishment the ibrd had an authorized capital of us  billion countries subscribing shares were required to pay in only onefifth of their subscription on joining the remainder being available on call but only to meet the ibrds liabilities if it got into difficulties moreover not even the onefifth had to be paid in hard cash at that time the sole cash requirement was the payment in gold or us dollars of  of each countrys subscription a further  of the subscription was payable in the currency of the member country concerned and although this sum was technically paid in in the form of notes bearing no interest it could not be used without the members permission in  each member was given an opportunity to double its subscription without any payment thus for countries joining the ibrd after the  capital increase and for those subscribing to additional capital stock the statutory provisions affecting the  and  portions have been applied to only onehalf of their total subscriptions so that  of each subscription that is freely usable in the ibrds operations has been payable in gold or us dollars and  that is usable only with the consent of the member is in the members currency the remaining  is not paid in but is subject to call by the ibrd financial resources for lending purposes the subscriptions of the ibrds members constitute the basic element in the financial resources of the ibrd subscribed capital for fiscal year  was about us  billion the bank also draws money from borrowings in the market and from earnings in  the banks outstanding borrowings were us  billion raised in the capital markets of the world the ibrd is able to raise large sums at interest rates little or no higher than are paid by governments because of confidence in the bank engendered by its record of stablility since  and the investors knowledge that if the ibrd should ever be in difficulty it can call in unpaid portions of member countries subscriptions in connection with its borrowing operations the bank also undertakes a substantial volume of currency and interest rate swap transactions these swaps have enabled the ibrd to lower its fundraising costs and to expand its direct borrowing transactions to markets and currencies in which it otherwise would not have borrowed b lending operations the ibrd lends to member governments or with government guarantee to political subdivisions or to public or private enterprises the ibrds first loan us  million for postwar reconstruction was made in the latter part of  altogether it lent us  million for postwar reconstruction all to european countries the ibrds first development loans were made in the first half of  as of  june  the cumulative total of loans made by the bank was over us  billion loan terms and interest rates the ibrd normally makes longterm loans with repayment commencing after a certain period the length of the loan is generally related to the estimated useful life of the equipment or plant being financed since july  ibrd loans have been made at variable rates the lending rate on all loans made under the variablerate system is adjusted semiannually on  january and  july by adding a spread of to the ibrds weighted average cost during the prior six months of a pool of borrowings drawn down after  june  since july  only borrowings allocated to lending have been included in the cost of borrowings with respect to new loans and existing variable rate loans that are amended to apply the new cost basis for interest periods beginning from  july  through  december  the variable lending rate was  before july  loans were made at fixed rates and accordingly the semiannual interestrate adjustments do not apply to payments made on these older loans c purposes of the loans the main purpose of the banks operations is to lend to developing member countries for productive projects in such sectors as agriculture energy industry and transportation and to help improve basic services considered essential for development the main criterion for assistance is that it should be provided where it can be most effective in the context of the countrys specific lending programs developed by the bank in consultation with its borrowers in the late s the world bank came under criticism that its policies intended to encourage developing countries to restructure their economies in order to render them more efficient were actually imposing too heavy a burden on the worlds poorest peoples this and charges by environmentalists that world bank lending had underwritten projects that were severely detrimental to the environment of developing countries led to a rethinking of the banks policies in the s implementing the banks poverty reduction strategy the fundamental objective of the world bank is sustainable poverty reduction underpinning this objective is a twopart strategy for reducing poverty that was proposed in the world development report  the first element is to promote broadbased economic growth that makes efficient use of the poors most abundant asset labor the second element involves ensuring widespread access to basic social services to improve the well being of the poor and to enable them to participate fully in the growth of the economy progress in implementing the povertyreduction strategy is clearly visible in bankwide statistics on new lending at the september  annual meetings of the world bank group and imf ministers agreed to link debt relief to the establishment of a poverty reduction strategy for all countries receiving world bankimf concessional assistance sector and structural adjustment lending bank lending for sector adjustment and structural adjustment increasingly supports the establishment of social safety nets and the protection of public spending for basic social services in its assistance to countries that are preparing adjustment programs the bank works with them to a design the phasing of programs to accommodate the needs of the poor b give priority to relative price changes in favor of the poor early

in response to one of the biggest challenges facing the banks client countries how to create a favorable business environment and help finance small and medium enterprises in addition to creating a new combined unit to coordinate bank group activities help capitalize local financial institutions and teach them the business of financing small and medium enterprises the restructuring also involved the creation of joint world bankifc departments or product groups for industries where there is a strong interface between public policy and private sector transactions three new industry groups
