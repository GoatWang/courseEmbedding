provider of precision forged and fabricated solutions we manufacture rolled rings and other related components designed to be used in the wind power industry as well as for other uses die forging for greater strength and flexibility we employ axial closedie forging technology in producing precision forgings a technology for producing rotary precision forgings we made the forging machine ourselves providing a strong advantage in machine maintenance and cost compared to other companies using foreign equipment our rolled rings are essentially hollow cylindrical sections forged from a stainless steel stock of varying thickness and height the rings are called rolled rings because of the nature of the forging process forging is a manufacturing process where metal is pressed pounded or squeezed under great pressure to create high strength parts rolled ring forging turns a hollow round piece of metal under extreme pressure against a rotating roller thereby squeezing out a singlepiece ring without any welding required although rings can also be manufactured through machining or casting we believe that forging produces a finished product with greater strength and flexibility a ring’s strength affects its fatigue resistance and is determined by the orientation of the grain flow of the ring’s metal material unlike the machining process which creates a unidirectional grain flow or the casting process which creates no grain flow the forging process is designed to cause alignment and orientation of the grain flow in a direction creating maximum strength thereby providing maximum fatigue resistance this high strength property also reduces sectional thickness and overall weight of the ring without compromising the overall integrity of the finished product the many uses of rolled forged rings high tangential strength and ductility make forged rings wellsuited for torque and pressureresistant components such as gears engine bearings for aircraft wheel bearings couplings rotor spacers sealed discs and cases flanges pressure vessels and valve bodies as such rolled rings have a wide variety of applications presently the majority of chinese rolled ring producers rely on technologies such as the steam hammer and friction press which consume large amounts of energy and cause pollution and which we believe generate a less desirable product yaw bearings which are found in every wind turbine are made from rolled rings essentially a yaw bearing is a large ring with teeth all of which are either pointing outward or inward the teeth allow the yaw bearing to engage with a smaller wheel attached to the yaw motor the yaw motor turns the wind turbine so that the rotor to which blades are attached faces the wind in order to optimize electricity generation the yaw bearing is used by the yaw motor to turn the wind turbine dyeing and finishing equipment segment we design manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanicalelectrical integration our products are widely used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton cottonpolyester terylene polyester wool polyacrylic fiber nylon cotton ramie and wool yarn environmentally friendly airflow dyeing machines we now design and produce airflow dyeing machines which use air instead of water water is used in the traditional dyeing process we believe that our airflow technology which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards results in reduced input costs fewer wrinkles less damage to the textile and reduced emissions with the growing acceptance of our new dyeing technology and the china government’s mandate to phase out older machinery in china’s textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards we expect further success in the future after treatment compacting machines our new aftertreatment drying and compacting machine is used in the final finishing of knitted material such as cotton and is designed to improve the softness reduce shrinkage and ensure better dimensional stability we believe that our equipment offers performance similar to german and us imports at a more attractive price garment washing machines for denim we are currently developing a new garment washing machine for denim made of stainless steel and customized for use by chinese jeans manufacturers the machine is capable of stone wash enzyme wash and other water washing techniques we believe that our machine will offer superior quality and performance at an attractive price relative to machines imported from germany and the us and expect it to be well received by potential customers operations our manufacturing site covers over  million square feet we have established stateoftheart fabrication machining assembly and finishing workshops and a stateoftheart forging facility with a ton press and a ringrolling mill that employs our advanced axial closedie forging technology this facility has an annual capacity of  tons we are leading specialists in the manufacturing of · proprietary high and low temperature
