with tiebacks from the roger thomas collection for samuel  sonsthis article originally appeared in the march  issue of architectural digestthe title “mr las vegas” may technically belong to entertainer wayne newton but by rights it should go to steve wynn after all were it not for wynn and the opulently appointed resortcasinos he’s created in the city—a list that includes the mirage and the bellagio—it’s hard to imagine the desert destination enjoying its current appeal to affluent travelers for whom gambling is only part of the draw and wynn did it not by abandoning the glamour and glitz that made vegas famous in the first place but by marrying those traits to the same passions—quality craftsmanship beauty creative vision—that have made him one of the world’s foremost art collectorsall those attributes are on prominent display at his expansive manhattan duplex a place he and his wife andrea use for regular east coast visits today wynn’s company has two properties in the nevada city—the wynn las vegas and the encore at wynn las vegas—as well as two in macau where a third resort the wynn palace cotai is slated to open in  with a relentless travel schedule the businessman clearly relishes his time in new york “it’s such a kick to have friends over when we’re here” he says “in las vegas we don’t entertain at home so here it’s more of a residential experience”located across from central park in a landmark building a former hotel the wynns’ apartment sits high above the treetops and contains a onetime ballroom so there are dramatic views but also on the residence’s main level astonishing foot ceilings “i walked in here and said ‘man what a place’” wynn recalls and even though the unit was larger than what he’d envisioned for his piedàterre it had the pizzazz he was looking for furthermore since the building’s construction policy was less restrictive than those at many prime new york addresses he would have the opportunity to transform the dwelling to his specifications in a matter of monthsfor this he turned to his longtime associate roger thomas the executive vice president of design for wynn design  development having worked with the hotelier for more than  years thomas has played a pivotal role in virtually all of wynn’s hospitality projects as well as his residences “i couldn’t do what i do if it wasn’t for roger” wynn says with the manhattan apartment the two focused on decorative enhancements most importantly a lighting scheme well suited to wynn’s worldclass artworks among them paintings by picasso willem de kooning roy lichtenstein and andy warholstructural changes to the duplex were overseen by mark ferguson of the new york city firm ferguson  shamamian architects who managed to finish the work in a lightningfast five months while ferguson orchestrated many critical unseen upgrades such as complex lighting and hvac systems he also contributed one of the home’s most arresting features the staircase linking the main floor to the private spaces below in its previous incarnation this key artery lacked drama so ferguson replaced it with a showstopping sculptural form of curved glass and ebonized english sycamorethis new york apartment features a museumworthy art collectionview slideshow  the new york duplex of steve wynn and his wife andrea features interiors by roger thomas head of design for wynn design  development ferguson  shamamian architects oversaw the structural renovation a willem de kooning painting takes center stage in the living room where swivel chairs by a rudin flank a holly hunt cocktail table topped with an alberto giacometti bronze the walls are covered in a sahco fabric the curtains are of a larsen silk blend the side tables are by brueton with lamps by boyd lighting from donghia and the carpet is by tai pingto complete the decor meanwhile thomas laid down custommade wool carpets and selected vibrant matisseinspired colors for the wall coverings and upholstery “the wynns are happiest on a boat in the mediterranean” thomas explains “so i suggested seablue with a sunny yellow” this palette is most evident in the living room where bespoke blue velvet sofas and golden chenille swivel armchairs keep company with a vast de kooning canvas at one end and an equally formidable lichtenstein at the other it’s a combination that makes for a powerful impressionhigh impact is what steve wynn has long been known for and this residence fits his reputation—from the eyecatching circular glass light fixture that hangs in the striking red dining room to the billiard room’s shapely whitelacquer pool table to the crimsonandgold hervé van der straeten console that commands the foyer still when asked to identify what he finds most pleasing about his manhattan perch wynn shifts his gaze over to the towering arched windows that grace every room on the home’s main level “the apartment puts light and the green of central park front and center” he says “that’s why it’s so exhilarating”exploreinteriorshomesnew york cityadroger thomasdecormagazinemarch ferguson shamamiancontributorcarlos motapin this storyfacebook share this storytweet this

conference call all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speakers’ remarks there will be a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you i would now like to turn the call over to stephen cootey chief financial officer stephen cootey thank you very much and good afternoon joining the call on behalf of the company today are steve wynn matt maddox kim sinatra and myself here in las vegas also on the phone are the operational management teams from both – our boston las vegas and macau properties before we get started i just wanted to remind everyone that we will be making forwardlooking statements under safe harbor federal securities law and those statements may or may not come true and with that i’m going to turn the call over to mr wynn stephen wynn hello everybody and it’s very nice to have this call i think you’ve seen our earnings that we were happy with macau we held a high but we made  million more than we did last year and it’s another increase in our quarter and even though we held a high we were also carrying an equal amount of extra payroll for the palace which opens next month so the increase is real we’ll be transferring all those employees in the next few weeks – in the next few days actually and so we’ll have a different expense pattern for the peninsula operation of wynn and encore in the months ahead as we equalize the payroll i think we mentioned table allocations in our press release and i’d like to take a moment or two to comment upon those and give some insight to those odd people that are on this call according to the operator we havent analyzed in the past as we headed towards the opening we’re unable because of the table cap to predict how many tables we would get so we established long time ago various scenarios where we could operate from  tables to  tables and new tables on how to operate both hotels – all three of them actually – efficiently and profitably some of the things that you may find interesting for example in a recent month – and this is pretty typical – we had  tables allocated at wynn and encore to vip to junkets and then we analyzed as we do now for the past year we’ve had a completely different focus in this company about the gambling activity of our clientele and instead of analyzing the casino on wynn or turnover we’ve analyzed both in the united states and in the peoples republic of china and macau we’ve analyzed and we’ve run our business on a completely different model and that model is contribution to ebitda to profitability of each unit in the casino regardless of wynn or turnover or activity of a gambling customer what instead we look at is how much money do we make with such pieces of equipment whether it be a table a baccarat table or a slot machine and the results of our inquiry both in the united states and china have been very very enlightening and i’ll share them with you as an example of  junket tables in a month  of them were responsible for all of the ebitda the other  were either breakeven or in some cases losses taking all costs into account that is to say that our profitability was limited to a much smaller group than one would have first imagined and we made a number of very startling changes in the way we laid out our casino the policies that we employed with regard to the rules of the game – craps blackjack and baccarat roulette included – that embraced limits the moments with the client when we would give free promotional allowance allocations of rooms food beverage or airfare we took a different look at all of that and since last july  a year ago or a little over a year ago we changed wynn las vegas and wynn macau because we were the largest recipient of asian business in our hotel in las vegas and when that business tailed off as it has in the industry we lost  million in wynn at one point – that’s how big our baccarat business was that we could lose  million – and we were left with a smaller number we used to give discounts to blackjack players and crap shooters we dealt blackjack at three to two if you got  we started putting in tables where we paid six to five and dealt single decks or double decks we changed the layout of the floor we put our higher yielding games in more prominent locations we put destinationtype games like craps in secondary locations we changed the amount of free odds that we gave at dice games from what was commonly referred to as the  game and that had to do with the amount of free odds you get if you made a line bet to double odds to give you an example when someone has a  crap game the house advantage is  basis points  basis points when you go to double odds the house advantage is  basis points or  basis points now that doesnt sound like a lot that’s a very narrow margin of a house advantage mathematically however  basis points is a  or  increase in the margin of a dice game so that the outcome in terms of profitability was based upon a rather granular analysis of each game we made a bunch of changes and in so doing we were able to overcome in terms of profitability what would ordinarily have been a massive loss of top line revenue so the gaming industry is a little deceptive in many respects it takes a very sharp analysis and very high degree of selfawareness – because when you take rooms away from the casino block and you can sell them for cash our margins in the hotel rooms are very high as they are in slot machines casino table games in las vegas if you were to do an analysis would have a profit margin in the teens at best we were able to take our profit margins in table games up into the s which i think is unique in our industry well this kind of analysis applied to china is also very enlightening and instructive having allocations having table caps as we are experiencing in places like pennsylvania – this week i stopped at bethlehem at the sands facility and i was watching what an alert management team did to offset limitations imposed politically on the amount of tables and they used a concept known as stadium games where you use three or four dealers for roulette and blackjack and have  automated digital stations for players that allow people – it’s a much more efficient use of an allocation of tables because you get  players with four dealers and in the case of bethlehem when i watched the other day on tuesday they were able to take advantage of that and introduce people at lower minimum table limits to roulette and baccarat who might not have played those games were it not for the low entrylevel afforded by this stadium concept now we use those at the wynn macau and the – and they’re being used in singapore and around the country and i suspect that because of the payroll efficiency inherent in such concepts that we’re going to see more of it and it allows us to make better use of our staffing levels and offer the opportunity for excitement on a playing level to customers in a manner that’s very efficient having said all that we anticipate the following aspects of our business which will not impact our profitability that by having fewer games you get to have a higher utilization remember in most casinos around the world utilization is less than  you’re sort of keeping the payroll and the games for peak periods weekends a few shifts a week by having fewer tables you increase utilization dramatically and you’re able to control limits so lets get to the second part of my presentation which is this a close analysis of the market in macau will demonstrate that the bulk of the profitability in business is in what is now referred to as premium mass business we distinguish between mass and vip because in the mass very much like america people buy in for cash they play with regular chips that are negotiable as opposed to the vip or junket end where we use nonredeemable chips that are purchased by junket operators who supply to us and then the customer is forced to bet that nonredeemable chip and they keep betting the nonredeemable chips and they save the redeemable ones and then either cash out or buy more nonredeemable chips in which case they get a little discount my point is this the money we make and the margin that we enjoy is based upon the vast premium end and that premium mass end is not a hard line of division it isnt a question of ‘well one guy bets  using us currency for a moment bets  and a premium guy bets  no there is a whole range in between where people bet   a decision but they’re playing in the mass area of a casino we refer to those as a more premium customer now the wynn palace in cotai was designed from day one six years ago specifically for premium mass business some of our competitors who are very intelligent operators they’ve designed buildings that are specifically designed for the lower end of the mass market the wynn palace is not such a structure the rooms the restaurants the retail all of the amenities the layout of the place its entire conceptual framework was based upon getting the higher type of mass player so we were always in a position to operate our casino with less equipment than our competitors incidentally to give you an example of that when we opened wynn las vegas we had close to  slot machines and we won  million a year today even with encore we win well over  million with less than  machines technology has played a role in this and it is playing a role in table games as well so to close this little presentation of mine we feel positive and comfortable about the hotel and we’re looking forward to the opening on  august and i’m hoping that some of the things that i’ve just highlighted in my comments are instructive to all of you one other note away from china and the united states – and las vegas for a moment is on tuesday at  o’clock we expect to get our final environmental permit in boston and begin fullscale construction on wednesday although we’ve had hundreds of people at work already on areas that were not impacted by the environmental permit work that was necessary to build our building on things like a slurry wall and other preparatory construction aspects of the foundation but hard construction begins on the tower itself wednesday morning and we dont anticipate any other interference with that process i think that about covers it matt steve – bob desalvio is on the call from massachusetts and is happy to elaborate on any of the comments that i’ve made or any of the questions you may have which you can begin asking right now thanks for your attention questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from joe greff from jp morgan joe greff hello everybody steve thanks for your comments your perspective putting on the top of the table game allocation along the same lines along the same topic does – the fewer initial amount of table games than say  to  that maybe some people were thinking does that alter the amount of laborrelated opex shift from peninsula to cotai stephen wynn ultimately depending on utilization it will as it always does you adjust your workforce based upon the demand that you have from your customers but that’s something that you see as time goes by joe joe greff got it and then just to make sure we all understand this is there a chance that you could open with more than  and – i ask it knowing that galaxy i guess went through a process maybe got a little bit more to open and then got  more and then  more after that do you have a timetable for when more tables would be released i guess with a second go around of additional table games being allocated would that be more of a  event or could that be a late  event stephen wynn joe we havent been formally notified in the manner that the government does such things yet and i suppose it is possible what we do in the absence of official notification is we make plans to run at a minimum efficiently and then if demand calls for it and the government decides that it’s a good idea then we respond when they give us the tables but they dont tell us in advance about such things and so the best thing for us to do is not to plan for it joe greff got it and then a final question for steve cootey can you allocate the ebitda impact the positive favorable ebitda impact in macau from the high hold stephen cootey about  million stephen wynn it was about the same as the extra payroll we’re carrying joe joe greff yep yep indiscernible just wanted to clarify that great thanks all operator and our next question is from shaun kelley from bank of america shaun kelley hi good afternoon maybe just to followup on that payroll comment so the  million of extra headcount that was being carried that’s still – those are all employees that are currently at wynn macau will be shifted over to the palace and then in addition was there additional staffing that’s going – that’s feeding the preopening line which is why we saw that expand stephen wynn let me clarify that we were carrying  million to  million a quarter of extra payroll in the peninsula operation for macau all of those people are being transferred as we speak and they are employed at the current table limit level the extra tables were we to get them would have been reflected in new hires which have not taken place so the people that we said we’re transferring we are transferring and they are employed does that answer your question i want to make sure i’m responding properly stephen cootey and i think from an accounting standpoint what you’re talking about shaun is to be clear wynn palace will have  employees roughly  will come from wynn macau so when you see preopening ramping up that’s the other  people that are coming onboard right now and came onboard in the second quarter that’s that  million in preopening out of the  million it was related to wynn palace hires outside of the transfers shaun kelley perfect no i understand that makes perfect sense and my second question would just be on we look a little closer at the vip line it looks like perhaps the rebate percentage was a little higher than normal usually that may have to do with what’s going on in the direct vip business but any color you could provide on that stephen cootey there was no change in commission structures in the second quarter stephen wynn yeah you got me on that one i’m not sure what line you’re looking at linda is on the call or ian is ian do you have a comment on that ian coughlan we havent altered our commission structure it remains the same we’re very parsimonious i’m not sure what’s being referred to shaun kelley no just sorry maybe to be more clear just asking about was there any kind of hold outside of the norm on the direct vip business stephen wynn was there any hold you mean did we play lucky shaun kelley yes stephen wynn we did stephen cootey we did stephen wynn we did i did to the extent – i think we played lucky almost exactly to the extent of the extra payroll we were carrying so what i’m saying is the  million increase is real stephen cootey we played lucky in both direct and junket both sides they make up that combined number of  or percentage ph shaun kelley okay got it thank you very much operator and our next question is from carlo santarelli from deutsche bank carlo santarelli thanks guys matt for starters you just mentioned playing lucky in both direct and vip and junket could you maybe clarify a little bit what the mix in terms of drop or something is of the two segments at this point matt maddox carlo we normally dont do that getting into the mix of direct versus vip we always – i can tell you both held high in the  on the  billion in turnover stephen wynn generally what is relevant to this conversation is that we have three or four very priced junket operators who consistently produce for us and produce profitable business for us compared to any other equipment in the building and they’re going to be both – they’re all established with proper tables in both cotai and in the peninsula in august at the opening regardless of anything that we’ve discussed so far but we also run our own program very much like we do in las vegas where we give credit to people in hong kong where we’re permitted to do so and those numbers jump up and down depending on who shows up to give you an example in the last week in las vegas in five days we won  million in our own program in baccarat from a handful of customers so we get this – we benefit from having an extremely loyal highend group of customers that come to us in a number of ways some through junkets in china and some in our own programs here and they vary – the volatility or the attendance of such clientele varies unpredictably from month to month and week to week so the reason we dont discuss it is because it would be irrelevant it’s not instructive and it’s unpredictable carlo santarelli okay stephen wynn which is why we dont give guidance on it because we really dont know what to say other than what ive just told you carlo santarelli great thats helpful and then if i could just understand a little bit more how you’re thinking about the positioning you’ll obviously open wynn palace with  if i’m not mistaken your allocation or your table allotment coming it was like  or somewhere around there plus the  is  stephen wynn it’s  plus  it’s  carlo santarelli  okay sorry about that so you’ll have  at the existing plus your  how are you thinking about the splits between mass and vip at each of the properties now will you try and lean more heavily… stephen wynn  or so in both hotels in the junkets and vip and the rest are in mass so the mass floor is unaffected carlo santarelli great perfect thank you very much stephen wynn the adjustment takes place in the vip section carlo santarelli understood thank you operator and our next question is from jon oh from clsa jon oh thank you my question pertains to the  tables that you are shifting from wynn macau i think this number is a little higher than what we are modeling generally speaking so as i am thinking about the cost shift and the expense shift that will be moving from wynn macau to wynn palace that’s a positive thing how should we also be thinking about the potential that you’re actually peeling off more of wynn macaus tables and what it would do to your revenue of your existing wynn macau basically im trying to understand this risk of selfcannibalization which i think steve you brought to point that maybe only  tables out of the  in vip are contributing to the profits so you have some slack to pick up there but what about some of the mass market tables and premium mass market tables in existing wynn macau today that you may have to shift to get wynn palace to the right size how do you feel about this risk of selfcannibalization in the coming weeks as you open wynn palace stephen wynn well that’s the good news the shift is irrelevant because the tables that are left at wynn las vegas are the ones that – and in encore are the ones that were making the money we’re not touching the mass floor that’s the point we had an enormous amount of tables that were idle with payroll in anticipation of the shift to the other place so in one way it’s fortuitous that we’re not affecting our premium mass capacity or potential in terms of tables at wynn macau and encore macau the adjustment was made in the junkets and sending out the junket operators and the tables they allocated to them our mass floor doesnt change our premium mass floor doesnt change in either place stephen cootey what you see jon is if you look at the numbers we have some poker games that are more of an amenity that would likely go that’s about  and then of the  or so mass games that would need to be transferred to get to those numbers those are underperforming games in certain areas that we rarely open so… this may be a fascinating – those of you who watch this industry so closely and our competitors as well may find this to be a fascinating observation when we concentrate this business on the tables that we have predetermined to be the ones that are most profitable and increase their utilization some of this speculation has to remain as speculation but i think you’re going to see the results quick enough in august the last week in august and in september leading up to golden week and i think that we might find this very instructive before it’s over and we dont do much spinning here we let the numbers speak for themselves but i want to point out that the trend in our industry has constantly been to less equipment and more efficient utilization of that equipment i also want to remind everybody that you cannot get dynamic in a casino you can only get dynamic in the noncasino area where you create attractions that produce people of a certain income level that make the place profitable i cant overstate that simple observation more strongly enough in a hotel casino in these integrated resorts the hotel itself is the show a lot of conversation has been promulgated about the diversification of gaming away from just gambling to nongambling things and that conversation has widely and largely been misunderstood so let me make a point about that now when you say diversify to noncasino things you have to understand that isnt a simplistic thing – ‘well we’ll have more restaurants we’ll have more shows we’ll have more this or that other than a slot machine or a baccarat table’ diversification means how well do you make the entire place an attraction from a hospitality and touristic point of view so that you dont just rely on a baccarat player or a slot machine player now that diversification involves the entire building we spent without exception and without any possibility of contradiction more money on noncasino attractions in wynn palace than has ever been spent on any facility of that sort on the planet earth and it has been done in the things that really matter to people – the width of the hallways the height of ceilings the attractiveness the decor the size of the rooms the elegance and luxury of the retail offerings and most importantly the entertainment quotient of each and every food and beverage outlet the customers of macau in the past – since  and even before with stanley hos operation the customers have a very distinctive personality they shop they eat and they gamble their attendance to traditional entertainment attractions has been unpredictable and in most cases unsatisfactory we saw a cirque du soleil show – remarkable company that we pioneered ourselves in las vegas – we saw that show open and close at the venetian the entertainment attraction at the city of dreams is primarily being supported by freebies when people that go in and are offered the experience complementary what we have seen at wynn macau and wynn las vegas the only fivestar facility in macau and the most complete in terms of five stars in spa five stars in food five stars in rooms – that’s very unique in the gaming industry – that is diversification when wynn palace begins at  o’clock in the evening on the night of august  everybody will experience visually for the first time – the press will see it the week before with me – the most diverse the most elegant the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world i say that unequivocally because it took us six years to be able to make that statement and all of you who have enough interest in the matter and the press will get to see it for themselves you’ll eat the food with the incredible array of chefs from pastry to – we have alain ducasse chefs in our coffee shop in this hotel it’s on the water experiencing  million or  million worth of entertainment on the fountains that filters through to the entertainment quality in each of the restaurants even in the gaming areas so in the lobbies tens of millions of dollars have been spent on floors that open the theme of the hotel is flowers we’re talking about ferris wheels carousels foottall fabergé eggs that open all made of flowers everywhere in the hotel there is entertainment public entertainment and in every aspect of the hotel the hospitality diversification has been intensified and redoubled and those are the things – if you want to take a hotel to another level not a casino a hotel then you have to revisit each and every component down to the most minute detail and revisit them ask all of the questions question your history question fundamental assumptions the ones that survive have survived crossexamination and recross and the new stuff emerges as you apply a great deal of selfcritical judgment in the designdevelopment phase all of this will be selfexplanatory and selfevident at  o’clock on  august to the rest of the world when this hotel takes its first breath publicly the press will get to see it and the financial community in the days preceding august  incidentally we adopted a technique i was asked ‘how do you want to handle the opening steve’ i said ‘i’ll tell you how i want to handle the opening i want to show the world i want to show the political leaders who dont attend these hotels i want them to see the villas the penthouses the entertainment attractions alone in small groups of tours in each of these remarkable moments in this building before it opens’ and then during the month that’s what i’m going to do on nd to our invited guests but in the weeks preceding august  all  or  of our employees will be in small groups of eight to ten and experience the identical tour and visualization of this hotel in tours with music and with fulltilt presentations so that by the time we get to august  there will be an awareness in the community of what we have built that is the policy we are following and it begins in two days and that is the indoctrination and the display when you talk about the villas and the penthouses and the other attractions in this hotel normal people will never get to see them they’ll be reserved for special guests that are being entertained that are being fed in these restaurants the politicians and political leaders union leaders line employees will never see every part of this place because they’re specialized in certain parts of it but our job from august  to august  will be to make sure that anybody who works for the wynn macau company in either the peninsula operations or the one in cotai are completely exposed to what we have built for them as a place to work because at the end of the day this is all about our employees because if our employees have a sense of the place and its luxury and its special nature then they will pass that on to the public those are our strategies those are our philosophies that’s our thinking and we’re going to bring it all to bear along with odd years of experience to see if we can get this place off and running in a nice way it was built to take market share no question about it no need to pussyfoot about it and we’ll see if we can keep the promise personally i saw it three weeks ago i thought it was the most joyful place we’ve ever built my wife andrea and i walked through the building and we were quite dazzled by it i’m hoping that all of you will be indiscernible jon oh okay thank you for the color if i may followup with another question i think you made a statement earlier about premium mass and it seems like that’s going to be the front and center of the wynn palace strategy could you size up the state of the premium mass market today specifically if you could maybe give us some sense as to some visitation trends you’re seeing and also customer spend are you seeing any encouraging signs right now and how do you feel about the state of this market we know your position very well given the product that you’re building but any color on premium mass as a segment will be very helpful to us thank you stephen wynn ian coughlan my irish boss do you want to talk ian coughlan sure what we’ve seen in premium mass at wynn macau specifically is very sticky customers and we’ve been allowed over the last  months to grow the midtier premium mass we’ve cultivated a lot of new players it’s been very strong for us we’ve allocated more tables to premium mass and it suits the property so they’re our type of customers it’s been running very well and we’re very confident about premium mass at wynn palace we have the product to support it and we’ve built the place for our premium mass and wynn macau is no different so we are seeing finally a return of some of the higherend premium mass players we’ve seen that particularly over the last eight weeks so it’s strong it’s steady it’s stable and we’re looking forward to wynn palace and cotai being a different market with lots of premium mass there to harvest stephen wynn and jon on all three months – april may and june – we were up in the mass segment yearoveryear jon oh thank you that’s very helpful stephen wynn who’s next operator our next question is from felicia hendrix from barclays felicia hendrix hi good afternoon i just want to switch gears for a second if i may because my question is on capital allocation so steve so you’re opening up wynn palace in about a month a little less than a month right and then we move to boston and – by the way congratulations on getting closer to commencing construction there so in a few years boston will be open and then following those two projects you should be back to generating strong free cash flow the next project in line is obviously paradise park if that gets approved so im just wondering how do we think about your free cash flow as you’re building out that project in vegas is there a scenario where you’re returning cash to shareholders while you’re also embarking on construction in vegas once boston is open stephen cootey felicia i think we always return cash to shareholders and we’ll continue as long as our business remains robust to pay dividends that’s been our policy from the beginning of this company and once – as you look at our balance sheet it becomes quite strong we expect over the next  months and our capital allocation will be exactly what it’s been stephen wynn we’re in construction felicia and we have been for several weeks on our wynn plaza shopping center on the strip on the sidewalk on the strip between wynn and encore so we’re very happy with that and the leasing is proceeding and that project is underway and will finish next year felicia hendrix okay im sorry stephen wynn im sorry that’s all i just wanted to throw that in we did start that job and it’s going well okay great and then steve so when we think about macau right and a lot of the questions i think that were being asked today are kind of coming from the base of people trying to figure out what’s going to happen in the very near term right like is the new supply going to grow or cannibalize the market and that’s an interesting debate but when we look out further a year two years out and given the stabilization the market is seeing now especially given the market – the stabilization that the market is seeing now do you feel more comfortable about your growth projections for the market as you look out a few years and just as a followup to that how much of your vision in macau relies on proper infrastructure being in place like the bridge and the light rail that sort of thing stephen wynn well we’re seeing numbers today that have no bridge no monorail none of those remarkable infrastructure additions that the government has instigated they’ve not yet matured and come into season so what we’re seeing is the picture that you’re sharing with us at the moment based upon the numbers from ourselves and the other gents and the other companies in macau the things that are in the pipeline the bridges it’s mightily being constructed monorail with its growing pains seems to be settling in and work is proceeding on that those things all add to the viability of all of the operators in the special administrative region and they can do nothing but help as far as i understand them all they can do is make it easier for more people to get to macau the penetration of macau in terms of the general population is still small the room for growth is astronomical when you consider coming to play and how many folks there are the visitation in macau is being augmented and enhanced not only by these infrastructure projects that are breathtaking that bridge and the monorail the light rail but by the very facilities that the concessionaires have invested in and that have opened galaxy and venetian and the city of dreams and the studio city are very aggressive massive projects and then parisian comes on shortly and then eventually we’ll have the sjm property which i think they’ve in a stroke of real originality called the palace that comes on at some time next year i guess when is that due matt matt maddox im not sure i think it’s further out stephen wynn further out but the parisian is around the corner matt maddox it’s a couple of weeks after us stephen wynn yeah so those things match and enhance the future of the market coupled with those infrastructure things that you mentioned now i dont know the final date of the bridge have they announced one lately when they expect to function to have functionality on the bridge i know the light rail – when ian coughlan  or  it keeps moving stephen wynn yeah in three or four years and what about the light rail ian ian coughlan  first phase  the second phase stephen wynn the first phase goes around two sides of our property and has its first stop right in the middle of the lake by our gondola station that’s the first stop from the ferry terminal and it goes around the north and the west side of our property and stops right smack in the middle next to our gondola station no exit there of course we did it deliberately and then that gondola station feeds the mgm which is coming along in a few months it feeds parisian it feeds the city of dreams and wynn the palace so i like the interaction of the infrastructure as it comes onboard and it sort of matches and enhances the performance of the buildings and the projects that have been built that’s how i look at it anyway it’s just sort of a – but i tend to be a longerrange looker at these things than quartertoquarter but that’s my job here so i’m feeling good about it i love our position in macau that concession was one of the most remarkable benefits ever bestowed on companies those of us who are privileged to have such privileges in the sar are very lucky the amount of money we’ve been able to make and the opportunity to create these places has been fabulous felicia hendrix well thank you stephen wynn yeah is there another question apparently not stephen cootey i think there is stephen wynn is there another question stephen cootey yeah operator our next question is from thomas allen from morgan stanley thomas allen hey how are you so you announced about a month ago the opening date of wynn palace and you started booking rooms can you give us any color around bookings you also have been hiring hosts any color you’re hearing from hosts on potentially pentup demand of people who havent been coming to the market and maybe will start coming again once the wynn palace opens thank you stephen wynn i think we’re at  occupancy already and we’ve only had the booking machine turned on for a matter of days ian coughlan june  steve we’ve started online sales and taken reservations and we’ve had a strong demand basically and our rate is at a premium on both the gaming and the nongaming so were looking very very strong for the first five weeks prior to golden week and then we go up from there into the s thomas allen thats helpful color thank you and then just talk about the macau peninsula property your slot volumes are really weak this quarter i think it’s the weakest number i have seen or we’ve seen since  anything driving that ian coughlan just the movement of big players they can affect the month and they can affect the quarter so the previous quarter was excellent so they’ll be coming back stephen wynn the slot machines are very much like the tables there are very big slot players in china and in our particular case when they show up it gets very exciting when they dont it’s a little bit more subdued thomas allen thank you very much operator our next question is from robin farley from ubs robin farley great thanks i have two questions one is how should we think about for the palace what percent of rooms will be sold cash sales versus given to players just how to think about that and then also i wonder how you think about how the us election outcome may impact business in vegas stephen wynn what a good question that is robin i’ll take the second question yeah go ahead ian gamal aziz steve this is gamal we initially planned for the initial period to be at  nongaming or cash business and  gaming and then we will eventually get into a  gaming  cash business robin farley okay great stephen wynn the election in the united states i think we’re all in the same position it’s almost impossible to predict exactly what effect that will have without getting into an economics discussion we have – sooner or later our political establishment is going to be forced regardless of party affiliation to deal with  trillion in debt that’s climbing by around  billion a day that means that in the treasury auction each month in downtown washington we’re printing money at the rate of  billion or  billion a month which is of course increasing the money supply and directly impacting the living standard or the buying power of the us dollar or people who are being paid like everybody on this call today now part of the frustration in america is the fact that the deficit is having an enormous impact on the living style and the living standard of americans but not all of this is well understood by the folks to use bill oreillys term the folks are being – their living standard being clipped by the deficit and by the printing of money and the increase in the money supply how long can this go on in the history of the western world inflating your way out of this kind of a problem taken to its extreme to use the weimar republic as an example people went grocery shopping with wheelbarrows full of currency now before the recession the euro was   on the dollar during quantitative easing   and  it went up to  that was a devaluation of the american currency by  now it’s  and to use that as a benchmark for a moment it isnt that the dollar got stronger it’s that the euro got weaker because they started quantitative easing and printing money in the euro community so this deficit issue impacts the mental health the frustration the positive sense of tomorrow that working people feel in america it hasn’t got to do with rich folks it’s got to do with government fiscal and monetary policy we have  trillion in public debt and  trillion in intergovernmental debt the coupon on that trillionandclimbing is around  and that’s with shortterm interest rates at zero virtually now the current fed the lady is going to keep interest rates where they are that of course protects all of the credit card debt of  trillion that’s out there and so we dont have mass panic on the credit card interest but i know that the government is in a quandary as to what to do about this now the issue about what’s going to happen with the election isnt so much an issue of trump versus clinton at the moment it’s a question of whether the house and the senate and the executive branch can get together and make americans feel safer and have a fiscal and monetary policy that isnt selfdestructive which currently it is now i know that in this time of year everybody is making all kinds of promises and declarations that they can do things or they will do things that of course they cannot without exacerbating the problems that are currently plaguing the country what is lamentable is that the public discourse today on both sides misses the point entirely we’re in the chicken for every pot season where everybody is promising the moon i recall that one of the most popular themes this year is that we’ve got to get student loans and the burden of student loans off the back of the kids well when the affordable care act was passed and it was going to have a negative impact on the deficit which its sponsors had promised it wouldnt the sponsors went looking for a way to offset  billion or so in additional deficit and they came up with the kind of a stunt that we did with fannie mae and freddie mac when we eliminated mortgage brokers and we just took the loans directly into fannie mae and freddie mac and that led to the collapse of  trillion off the system well they did the same thing with the department of education they gave the student loans directly from the department of education and eliminated any middle people and then they charged  points or  basis points for student loans instead of passing the savings because the department of education doesnt really have a cost of money but they’re making the student loans direct since the affordable care act bernie sanders didnt talk about that but that  basis points that carry is being made by the government to offset what would have been an even greater impact on the deficit by the affordable care act well if you really were sincere about making a better life for the kids you would have passed the loans from the department of education to the kids at cost which would have been interest free but this kind of hypocrisy which sort of is endemic to the whole system regardless of party has got to come to a halt because if it doesnt then it insinuates itself into economic demand for services and products it certainly insinuates itself into the price of everything from walmart to shoes and sneakers those things havent been by themselves become more precious the value of the dollar has declined i know that we talk about china fooling with their currency the united states has fooled with its currency even more aggressively than the peoples republic of china i’m not an apologist for china or anybody i am simply stating the fact but you wont see this in the conventions of either party you wont hear this sort of thing because it’s so uncomfortable to talk about it but the election could put america on a better track if all the senators and congressmen and the presidents and the cabinet members decide that they should or it wont i dont know about anybody on this call but i’m not in a position to make that prediction but it surely surely impacts the life of every american tax policy and all the rest all roll into this and businessmen across the country and people that work in businesses will be affected by this as sure as sunrise tomorrow and there seems to be a fear to deal with it directly so count me as one of those old white guys that’s frustrated robin farley okay thank you stephen wynn robin… operator and our next question is from david katz… stephen wynn i want to say something to robin robin theres  agencies in government and theres  million federal employees  million are in uniform  million of them are civilians covered by the sci union and the civil service act if you want to make government more efficient you’ve got to have a big idea that resonates with all of the government employees all  million of them and  agencies and it is going to have to be the kind of big idea that we used to run businesses which is namely to reinforce positively the behavior that we wish to encourage and that can be done with tax policy and with employment techniques in the federal government that works so well in the private sector if we told everybody in those  agencies you ran the business for x amount of dollars last year if you maintain service levels and you can save a dollar we will distribute  on every dollar you save to those of you in those departments you’d see the government contract in terms of its cost of operation overnight but you’d have to incentivize the people in those  million employees the way we incentivize people in the private sector and gain efficiency and better functionality but those big ideas dont seem to apply in washington enough of the speech go ahead with the questions operator our next question is from david katz from telsey group david katz hi afternoon two quick ones now that boston is becoming more of a tangible property and that this may involve getting bob into the act i’m curious how you can update us on how you plan to position it as we look around the geographic region there are other large properties other small ones but i think they tend to be more slot driven if you can talk about who your target market is and then im curious what your kind of longterm commentary might be around the table game business in las vegas which candidly has been a little bit hard to model whatever thoughts you have would be welcome thank you stephen wynn bob and i will do that together and i’ll lead that building in massachusetts is the wynn in every sense of the word – the rooms the suites the service the food the beverage the public entertainment the theatrical entertainment is everything that we do here we’re bringing a fivestar frontline integrated resort right into the center of massachusetts were the largest private investment in the history of that commonwealth and we are the second biggest employer except for the hospitals in the commonwealth and it’s going to be a doozy and it’ll deal to the same level of the market that we are dealing here bob desalvio we’re very lucky to get him come join us i was with him this week on the east coast in pennsylvania and bob you can pick it up from there robert desalvio sure we think of this market in a couple of different ways first of all an incredible local market we’ve got the only casino with  million people in the greater boston area and then when we branch out from there we’ve got about  million people of gaming age within a mile radius of the property so probably the most incredible local market available with one casino massport has been excellent in terms of the international destinations coming in and out of logan and we’re now up to  nonstop international destinations coming into logan so the opportunities for picking up areas that are very good for wynn with direct service to hong kong shanghai beijing and of course all the major capitals around the world provides us with a great opportunity for the international market and so we look at this on many different levels – local regional national international – and feel we can qualify for all of them so we’re very very bullish on it stephen wynn what about room rates in that city of boston bob robert desalvio right now extremely high and continuing to climb there’s a real shortage of rooms of course with healthcare life sciences biotech the universities there’s so much activity and so much building going on in the area and not enough quality hotel rooms so the rates continue to climb and we’ll be at the top of the market there’ll be nobody in the market that will have rooms even close to this so we are actually predicting that we will do very high adr in this particular property stephen wynn and we are the largest hotel in the metropolitan area in terms of total rooms – the biggest rooms in the east coast the largest room outside of las vegas in the united states of america in terms of footage and decor and the most amount of rooms in central massachusetts  minutes from logan airport the first hotel we’ve ever had that had nonstop service from china no gulfstreams needed i’m sorry indiscernible david katz i think the other part of my question was about the table game business in las vegas which has been a little bit hard if you have any sort of longerterm thoughts on it it would be very helpful thank you stephen wynn well we do and it’s what i led the conference call with gaming hasnt changed the price of gambling in  years and yet our cost of operating these places has climbed steadily over that period and the mentality of the marketing people and the gaming people to deal directly with that sector of the business has been trained has been grown and matured with a focus on the top line – the average bet the length of play how often does the customer come what is our chance of winning x dollars – and then lets get that customer give him a room pay for his airfare send a limousine give him a bottle of lafite rothschild do anything give him a shopping spree these are the earmarks of the superficial thought that has guided casino management for decades when it should have been focused on what is the profitability of every table and every customer now i’m not suggesting that they dont have profitability meetings and reviews at these various enterprises but i’m in a position to say that any examination by any financial person in or out of the industry will reveal that the profit margins of table games in the gaming industry in the united states of america stinks lousy less than  now these businesses end up with margins close to  because they have slot machines and rooms and bars and nightclubs but the forgotten sector has been profitability of table games we decided to take another look at that a year ago i remember exactly it was at the end of the second quarter and i went after it the first week of july and started moving furniture and changing rules in collaboration with my colleagues like maurice wooden who happens to be on vacation in hawaii this week matt maddox linda chen ian coughlan gamal aziz steve cootey – my chief financial officer – and everybody in china and we decided that there had to be a better way to do this you say it’s tough to model table games you i dont know how you do your model but if you do a deep dive in companies like the ones that line the strip in las vegas the regional casinos and take a look at the profitability of table games that model is shaky weve changed that here we dont care about the drop we dont care about that we care about the profitability of every foot in the casino we take a very merchandising retail approach to the floor incidentally i think sheldon has done that in china when he opened up years ago it’s harder to do it when you’re not living in an avalanche of revenue the way we did when casinos first started in macau in a daytoday disciplined grind of normal operation it requires reeducating all of the marketing and casino personnel to look at the customers differently we dont even issue promotional allowances or comps based upon past performance we do it on current business activity that is to say if you play this trip at a certain level we will give you free meals or free rooms but if you played that way last year and you show up this week we are waiting to see what happens this week that’s a big change in the way they though in this business and it requires a lot of discipline and frankly reeducation of the people that work in the casinos it took us months to get to where we wanted to be in las vegas but imagine we were able to overcome a loss of  million or  million in baccarat drop to make the same money or more in las vegas that’s hard to do but now when someone plays it’s a business it’s a business otherwise we sell the rooms to cash customers and we reallocate the space in our building the business model is constantly morphing and changing and is it not doing so in every business in the world and the prize goes to who’s agile we’re trying we’re trying we are so to speak in a commercial sense constantly in a yoga class so factor that into your modeling maybe youll be able to follow us soon david katz appreciate it thank you operator and there are no

craig billings thank you operator and good afternoon everyone with me in las vegas is steve wynn matt maddox kim sinatra maurice wooden ciaran carruthers also on the line are our colleagues in macau las vegas and boston just a reminder for today we will be making forwardlooking statements under safe harbor securities law and those statements may or may not come true with that ill turn it over to mr wynn stephen wynn okay you can see the numbers business is good for us weve been joining a research and sub activity at the topend in china our hotels there  were enjoying the continuing prosperity of wynn macau and the steady growth of wynn palace pursuant to plans and the expectations weve had since the inception of that project when we opened the hotel in cotai this past august we had  of the market in the first quarter we went to  and now were moving past  of market share so thats in spite of the fact that we are still surrounded by barricades and construction now it happens to be sort of a mixed message the construction interference in traffic and the isolation of our hotel is at an alltime high but its at an alltime high because the level of activity has increased im happy to say immeasurably especially in the monorail lightrail station that is right in front of our hotel and provides the greatest obstacle to movement of people but they are installing the escalators and there is a new contractor and they seem to have a whole new energy and vitality in getting the transportation system of  the transportation system that benefits us enormously the new ferry terminal is about to open the monorail goes from there the lightrail goes from the ferry terminal and all of that straight into cotai and it goes around our property on two sides and were the first stop and the people in it experience our lake and our fountains and then they stop right at our gondola that construction has been a tremendous barricade i mean literally a wall and now that seems to be getting to the stage where not only will it be completed later this spring that part of it but also the pedestrian crossover which is part of that construction will be available to us at about the same time this summer or this fall that mgm opens their construction activity and the blockage of the street is in an alltime high which is associated with the end game the last four months of construction or five months of construction that mgm is experiencing and the activity on our south side at sjm has also accelerated so we are blocked out but on the other hand there is good news ahead as the time between our suffering and our relief gets shorter the hotel at palace has been turned out from a guest point of view very sticky people stay with us coming back again and again filling the hotel and were happy about that so macau is a story of our neighbors and surrounding construction everything is moving along well ciaran carruthers is here in las vegas with me runs wynn macau ian is on the telephone in macau and both of those men and our financial people are available for answers in las vegas maurice wooden is sitting next to me and we had the biggest hotel quarter in the history of the company our revenues were up  and our cash was up and we had a really good quarter and we come to a final decision that ill discuss in a few minutes and about the golf course and that development bob desalvio is on the call in boston we started construction in july its a month job theyre slightly ahead of their schedule were eight months into it and  seven or eight months into it the job is bought out the gmp is finished and the project is bought out and were on our way to aprilmay opening in   months from now and again men are available for questions so im going to take a moment and bring everybody up to date on the project that has occupied a great deal of our attention from the last  months and that is redevelopment of the golf course the golf course rose  million netted  million  million or  million ph  people played golf and thats very nice its a beautiful indiscernible golf course but as a business its always a placeholder since we bought the place in the desert in the  that period is now concluded it is no longer a placeholder its a development site construction will begin in december and january and the first phase of it will go rather quickly what we decided after a year of development of fanciful and really imaginative ideas that include a mountain and features and gondolas and restaurants and nightclubs and hotel towers as we realized that we had a pressing issue in the company now we have a very very healthy convention and catering business in this hotel and we get a big premium for our space and we have our shows that are stationed that headquarter here are getting bigger every year and they are outgrowing us and my colleague chris annflad ph who has been with me since the mirage deal days when we built mirage and she came from caesars chris has been asking for more space she wanted just under  feet of convention ballroom space  feet and she wanted another  or  feet of meeting rooms and in order to accommodate the business that we are dealing to now and it had a certain profit level because of the catering cost plus business it had a certain impact on our occupancy of  or  and when feathered into our retail food and beverage and casino business it had a certain worstcase impact on ebitda of  million or more so we said all right we got all these great ideas that are going into this lagoon and this beachfront property but what should we do to take the most conservative but dynamic approach to this property and after all of the studies and the pricing we came to this conclusion that we were going to build we would master plan the entire event but we would build the beachfront meeting space ballrooms cabanas and pools that represented the certain need we had at the moment build the lagoon  feet long and  odd feet wide with  foot boardwalk with white sand beaches and watersports and attractions bar and food service build that first that would energize the real estate that the oddacres that is the golf course with its water rights and we would put this oddacre lagoon in the middle of it and then we would build our meeting space leave room for our new tower that could be a couple of thousand rooms we would leave room for everything master plan it but build at first the park that would immediately power up our existing restaurants our existing casino our existing convention meeting and catering operation with an absolute certain return on that investment of excessive  or  we have no better use for our money we keep  billion or  billion in the parent company and this would allow us to take the most conservative but the most dynamic approach to creating this we can affect this tremendous uptick in the value of our surrounding real estate and thats what we decided to do and thats what weve committed to plans and thats with the board of directors has approved and that is now a project and hard construction will commence in six or seven months because we are doing the drawings as we speak and weve been for a month or two but well do this with complete drawings and firm prices with guaranteed maxes and liquidated damages and all the other things we do to protect ourselves so thats the formula and well spend between  million to  million on it and well get the lagoon and these things up pretty quick by start at the beginning of the year we should be in shape within a year or so it goes very fast and thats pretty much the state of things i think ill let the rest of this time today be left to answering questions directed either at us or china or boston so go ahead with questions maam questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well pause for just a moment to compile the qa roster and your first question comes from the line of carlo santarelli with deutsche bank carlo santarelli hey thanks and thank you for the explanation on paradise park and as you think about the masterplan longer term i know when you guys originally kind of proposed the idea back in april at the analyst day a hotel and kind of broader scope was attributed to it could we kind of look at it today and say okay cotai is up and running macau is doing a little bit better but  and you guys are being a little bit more conservative with this spend going forward with the elements of the project that you think have highreturn associated with them in the nearterm and then could potentially branch into something larger with potential additional hotel towers more similar to the original contemplation down the road stephen wynn i couldnt have said it better myself carlo carlo santarelli okay okay thats easy then and then on… stephen wynn would you if i may carlo santarelli yes stephen wynn this idea if you build it theyll come has been something that ive done for the past  odd years but ive never had an opportunity that was so rich in options in my entire career in las vegas this golf course and this lagoon and the beachrun property every time we turn around someone else comes to see us to do something else with it or to buy a piece or to rent a piece or to do a jv and its been very exciting so i say well before i build my idea of a thing to go on that section lets put it out there lets feel it lets live with it for a while lets give everybody a chance to appreciate how dynamic this location is and how powerful the opportunity is maybe we miss something every once in a while when youre a wideeyed developer like myself and my colleagues its good to take a beat and so we did carlo santarelli understood and then if  maybe somebody could help out here obviously you guys had some favorables on the vip hold side maybe a little bit of light mass hold that looked like at peninsula but when you look at each of the three assets could you guys kind of give us what your sense was for normalized property level ebitda metrics stephen wynn nothing in china and a few million bucks in vegas carlo santarelli okay craig billings all right the direct hold was low and the junket hold was high so when you look at it there really was no hold impact on the peninsula carlo santarelli okay and now that was  so the threethree you were saying on the junket side is the junket side plays favorable the direct side played weak and kind of mitigate it craig billings thats right carlo santarelli okay okay great thank you guys stephen wynn sure operator and your next question comes from the line of joe greff with jp morgan joseph greff good afternoon everybody just so we maybe can get a sense of how to think about normalized margins on the peninsula i know there was a collection benefit and you had them from timetotime and i understand how you reserved for outstanding credit but can you talk about what that impact may have been at peninsula in the q just so we get a sense of how to think about normalized property level ebitda margin craig billings hey joe it was about  million joseph greff got that great and is it your sense that the rate of outstanding credits being paid off and that is thats ph benefiting for you and others on the vip side at macau is that starting to plateau or is there  do you feel that sustainable stephen wynn you can answer that question ian coughlan this is ian in macau weve had some favorable collection of credit and it certainly seems to be tied in with the stronger credit market in general and it has benefited for us for a number of quarters joseph greff okay and maybe just a big picture for you steve you referenced obviously a resurgence in the highend the topend in china it surely manifested in the numbers you reported tonight what do you think as driving that and how sustainable are those drivers from here i dont know if anybody has the right answer for that but if you can share with us your view stephen wynn i have a picture  i have an opinion on that and of course its just my opinion but ive said in these calls in the past that it would be a mistake to misunderstand the primary underlying driver of the chinese economy it is a massive thing and when you say that as i have in the past that we have a very positive and bullish look forward into our longterm position in macau at some point the longterm vision and the shortterm begin to meld as they are now the suppression of the vip market was something that was the result organically of a process that the administration of president xi jinping thought was appropriate for the country the elimination of corruption and it had secondary effects on highend products like shopping and automobiles and gaming was part of that but having made a corrective move in china there comes a point when the corrective move it sort of finishes and although corruption is still a major item in the prc the initial impact has softened because so much of the work that they thought had to be done was done and so people begin to return to normal spending habits and they are not so strongly influenced by public policy issues that involve public officials so the people are settling back into routines that theyre comfortable with and that includes going to macau and buying a new car or shopping at louis vuitton and weve always been part of that cycle and it wasnt going to be permanent and weve said that before longterm strength of the chinese concession is one of the most precious assets in modern day and we are just been seeing it and another thing they limited the expansion of macau in a number of ways first by the real estate that is available the last hotels to be built are being built at the moment sjm and mgm and that little sort of squired project was louis the xiv ph or something the guy with the red rolls royces building on colovon ph so the little boutique place thats it the new tower the rooms that were added at city of dreams is coming into the season and then thats it the door sort of closes on more supply and then we are just left with the enormous demand of china and thats sort of coming into play now again and i think you can see it continue thats my opinion joseph greff thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of stephen grambling with goldman sachs stephen grambling hey thanks for taking the question maybe a quick followup to joes last one just how do you think about the ultimate size of the demand from vip longer term and as you referenced vip returning how much of the recent strength has come from existing players versus new players and are you seeing any changes in that customer base based on either sourced industries or geographies at the two properties thanks stephen wynn what do you say ian ciaran what do you say ciaran carruthers were seeing  we are very cautiously optimistic in terms of how the business in the vip side is going on moving forward weve obviously seen some good growth over the last quarter quarterandahalf initial early signs are out that thats going to be sustainable in the short period for how long that can be sustained really is too early to tell id like to see another quarter or two of some good solid growth the upside of course is that with properties like ours we obviously benefit the most in the marketplace being that preeminent product for service and luxury so as that new liquidity enters into the marketplace the premium master rates in junkets we benefit more so them anybody else so cautiously optimistic but i think a little bit too early to call as a longterm sustainable story stephen wynn do you see ciaran do you see  he asked an interesting question i think the same old people come back or theyre new ones that youre seeing ciaran carruthers we are seeing some new ones but we are seeing a lot of the old players come back to us as well we are seeing some old faces that are coming back into the marketplace weve seeing some junkets that have been fairly stays over the last  months  months start to rebuild we recently had a junket at wynn macau during this quarter stephen wynn and another one is coming up this week ciaran carruthers thats right at wynn macau this junket went from two tables to ten tables about six weeks ago when they have been very solid through that period they continued to show good strength so again early indications are positive but cautiously optimistic looking forward stephen grambling thats very helpful and maybe if you turn back to las vegas steve can you just talk about any impact youre expecting from the raiders move there and how that may or may not play into what you ultimately pursue at paradise park stephen wynn love the raiders coming and i even spoke before the joint session of the senate and the assembly in carson city along with jim murren and the folks from harris were there we are very very happy this was whipped cream and cherry on the cake i mean getting professional sports into las vegas is a perfect thing i spent easter on vacation at the bahamas and one of my guests with me was dan snyder that owns the redskins and while i was there at bakers bay robert kraft was onboard and so is steve bisciotti that owns the ravens and we were all talking about how certain the owners were  we had  out of  votes to move the team here how certain everybody is that nfl games in las vegas are going to light it up super bowl without the game actually here is as big as new year practically in this town now when we have these home games or exhibition games in the city and we will have a stadium big enough for super bowl and the super bowl will be here more than once this place will go bonkers and speaking for our own hotel we figure to get a big share at the top end of that business so we believe that its a tremendous impact of the football team to the strip first of all regardless of where the stadium is built and i think that i know where its going to be built mark has an auction on piece of property just on the other side of i just opposite mandalay bay actually of russell road is a site that he is auctioned that may or may not be the final location for this big installation but i suspect we are going to have football here in  and i cant wait for it to happen what its impact will be on my development of the golf course is another story we are building the golf course to power up our existing assets and to allow us to expand in noncasino ways the power of las vegas i want to repeat once again that a casino is a passive place every slot machine and roulette table in the world is identical to every other what drives people what moves people are the noncasino directions and thats why in spite of the fact that weve had the most financially successful casino in the world other than singapore and macau right up until today never in my companys history and that includes mirage resorts palazzo mirage all the rest of them atlantic city biloxi or downtown las vegas the casino revenue has never been equal to  of the revenue its always been less and lately its almost two to one so what moves people are the adventures of a vacation great service and choice of activities the development of golf course is a direct aim at that mentality and the football team is just like adding into a symphonic orchestra the strings and percussion so we got tmobile arena that mgm and phil anschutz built aeg my guess is well end up with an nba team before this is over weve got a hockey team you fastforward  months or so and las vegas is i believe will be a sports capital how about that stephen grambling thats all great stephen wynn now with  rooms where is it better than here for that sort of thing and everybody wants to come here anyway from every city and other countries and well use that football stadium for soccer before its over or my name isnt steve so i think that recent developments portend very positively for las vegas stephen grambling great thanks im looking forward to going bonkers of the game too ill jump back in the queue operator and your next question comes from the line of felicia hendrix with barclays felicia hendrix hi thanks for taking my question ian and ciaran this will probably get directed to you so just wanted to first compliment you on the great performance in macau in the quarter and on the vip site both properties beat us nicely but on the mass depending on the property theyre either in line or slightly below our expectation so im wondering now that you have the vip piece of the puzzle in place whats the plan to drive mass growth and i know for you guys its primarily premium mass and then how would you describe that piece in the quarter relative to your expectations ian coughlan this is ian so looking at the premium mass portion at wynn macau it was really post opening of wynn palace about maintaining service levels and keeping the stickiness of the customers that we had downtown and weve been very successful and doing that and over at the palace it was about continuing that slow steady build of premium mass players from a quite distinct market and i have to say on both accounts its being successful the rampup period of wynn palace is not as quick as wed like it to be but its been very steady there is momentum and on the premium mass side we continue to build new players for wynn palace and as each weekend and each holiday period goes by we pick up more people weve done a lot of internal building of key host for the marketplace and we are out there hunting for players and making them happy and keeping them felicia hendrix and how are you seeing the promotional side of the business in that segment ian coughlan as referred to on previous calls cotai is more heavily promotionally driven and we are in that game and we are competing with everybody else we are not doing anything untoward we are not changing the dynamics of the market we are just competing fairly and weve got the nicest probably in cotai similarly downtown we still command the peninsula so were delivering on our promise both properties are in great condition and the player council building stephen wynn can i add something to this if those of you on the call have been there if you can visualize the physical layout our benefit downtown has been at the wynn macau that we were in a cross flow of the people from the surrounding casinos both sjms place the arc mgm and one on the corner star world in macau we were on opening day in august at the end  the east end of macau  of the cotai when we get through with next six to  months we are in the middle of sjm mgm and surrounded by the light rail the monorail so now we get this brand new center of energy called cotai east for lack of a better term that has a tremendous impact on our walkin mass business not only do we not enjoy this at the moment but we are blocked on our west side by barricades and construction as i mentioned so many times before but understand that when it finishes we are in the middle again and thats why the peninsula hotel has always had such a terrific mass business because they walk across the street and boom i mean when sjm opens their  rooms we are literally across the street from them and across the street from mgm and across the street from the new tower at city of dreams and all of that connectivity comes to bear as we move forward in the quarters ahead lot of things that mature that we thought they would be done by the time we were done i literally thought we are going to be last at one point and of course it turns out we were first not only with the transportation but the existing hotels in our neighborhood so its been a challenge to deal with that handicap but that comes to an end here pretty soon and then it swings the other way rather dramatically and weve got extra real estate to build more rooms and we will add to our room total because we know that we can fill them at a good rate felicia hendrix so thats helpful so its sounds like to taking everything together what you offset maybe to assume some sequential growth just from some of the programs youre doing but really the real growth in the premium side will come in all the construction has gone ian coughlan right thats what we believe felicia hendrix okay ian coughlan you just summarized management and boards conviction on this matter felicia hendrix great thats helpful and steve your comments earlier on the growth of the market particularly on the vip side are very helpful i think a lot of people are also a little cautious about is in the past wynn growth came in  when ggr grew too fast or perceptively too fast we would see the government either steadily or not so steadily make different policy changes to run in growth do you think there is a risk of government interference at this time or do you think this is a new normal given the new supply that needs to be absorbed stephen wynn we dont based upon our conversations with the government and our perception of things theyve said to other people we do not see any negative impact by central government or macau government activity matter of fact we see quite the opposite support and encouragement felicia hendrix great super helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of thomas allen with morgan stanley thomas allen hi so just on the wynn macau the peninsula property you are able to improve your market share by over  versus the fourth quarter i heard your comments to the last question around the strength in vip and the stickiness of your customers there but is there anything else youre doing differently to support that improvement in market share thank you stephen wynn yes we hired ciaran carruthers ciaran carruthers next question stephen wynn at the end of the day its about people isnt it and we are constantly strengthening the human resource side of this company and under ians leadership weve done so on number of levels now the way it works over there if somebody that we admire and is willing to come to work for us and we cant do a meeting of mind and if they are in the market they have to give notice and then they have this sitout cooloff period thats imposed by the laws of macau so some of these people that are coming to us have had  their arrival has been stunted by the law on june  we get another tranche of some of our new recruits and they are in training outside of macau to join our company and to pick up on our culture but have a steady program of muscling up marketing food and beverage casino and hotels one of the men thats coming to us is a five star executive he starts on june  tony is coming from the bangkok hotel where he got the five star he is joining us our new food and beverage vice president is finishing his cooling off period as well as several other people and im not quite sure how public i should get while theyre in the cooling off period but i will tell you that come june  we power up even more our executive leadership of the company craig billings steve there was one of the gift we gave ciaran when he joined us in january we added some tables to wynn macau we had it oversteered a bit in terms of table movement and now weve calibrated both properties for optimum efficiency and thats certainly help the quarter at wynn macau in the mass side stephen wynn and as you can see everybody this old business of the amount of tables was overrated its a thing i said in august and you can see that its not up the amount of tables its whos at them the matters and how long they stay thats the game we are in not the gross amount of tables weve never been the biggest at anything weve always been the one that captures the quality end of the market and those are the kind of buildings we build and those are the kind of people we hire that are join together because of a common desire to be part of high quality operation ciaran carruthers into that point if i can add across all of our business segments through the first quarter we had our average daily volumes exceeded the period and it may lead up to wynn palace ultimum ph so weve been able to regain  not only regain the business that we may have lost through palace ultimum weve grown on that as well as the market is lifted thomas allen congratulations definitely seeing in the numbers just moving onto vegas revenue was up  in the quarter ebitda obviously up  how does that market feel obviously there are one time things or its supporting the first quarter in the market in general but is that market feel like its starting to improve and maybe its specifically around highend asian player would be helpful thank you stephen wynn mr wooden is here maurice wooden so again i think the first quarter was a perfect balance of all areas you look at our gaming hotel food and beverage so we were perfect position where all those areas actually performed much better than they did last year looking forward our convention pace is outperforming outpacing any future historical metrics that we use and so we are on a really strong pace of  and  for convention bookings as well so here las vegas we are optimistic that well continue to look at revpar growth somewhere in the  for the year and looking into the future with respect to the kind of convention business thats really important to us we see tremendous growth there as well stephen wynn we will be constantly adding and developing a convention of the market especially the part where the money is which is the catering and meeting room and banquet business as opposed to the exhibit space itself for that were right across the street in the sands were right across the street from the las vegas convention bureau both of these entities are aggressive and we are in the crossfire so we love it and we are feeling good about our asian business as things improved in china weve always been the principal beneficiary of asian baccarat relentlessness in las vegas even before we open the mirage and the best chinese business then bellagio at the best part for our business and then when and on core at the best baccarat business and we feel almost just quickly as theyre doing macau we feel that here in las vegas up until including last night and this morning where baccarat numbers and given shift are  million stuff like that this place gives that business every week and its pretty cool and also we enjoyed that you may ask yourself why would asian people with so many casinos in their home territory fly  hours to las vegas and stay at a place like bellagio or the the venetian its because of the choices you have here its because of the noncasino venue that gets back to football team to basketball hockey and conventions and shopping restaurants this place this town is a real safe bet we ask our technical difficulty we say is anybody on the board of directors believe that las vegas would not in the next  to  years be one of the major destination tour cities in the world and no one has ever answered to that question and thats what we feel so good about our real estate and our opportunities here and then we are going to open this place in boston in two dozen months and we are going to have a case study of how grand hotel in the major metropolitan city can change the neighborhood for the better and be the largest private investment in the commonwealth of massachusetts and the second largest employer in the commonwealth of massachusetts behind mass general hospital so i like the direction we are in and im feeling comfortable about the pace of our growth and i dont feel like anybody is after us were moving along exactly the way we should be and my colleagues joined me in that conference thomas allen helpful thank you stephen wynn youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of robin farley with ubs robin margaret farley great thanks one macau question and one question about the us operations the macau question is kind of similar to other folks has been asking about that when you look at the greater number of rooms that you have on cotai versus peninsula when do you think that the mass drop there well get to exceed what you have on the peninsula stephen wynn good question robin im not the guy could answer that i know that linda is on an airplane because she was here with me last night she is on her way  linda chen back to macau ian and ciaran can you deal with robins question ian coughlan weve got  more keys at wynn palace and the waiting of casino rooms versus cash rooms is a lot lower than it is on the peninsula downtown on the peninsula its been virtually impossible for  years to get a room in wynn macau because its been so heavily casino driven cotai is a slightly different market but we have lots of room to grow casino customers and continue to hold high occupancy at wynn palace weve lifted occupancy at wynn palace from the lows in the third quarter to mids in the first quarter of  and there is quite a lot of activity in tour and travelling cash business but we have lots of rooms with casino market so as we gain momentum and continue to ramp up those rooms well got to midtier and premium mass customers ciaran carruthers and when that happens as soon as we straighten out the concession business well add several thousand rooms to cotai robin margaret farley okay great thanks and then my question on the us operations if you look at your budget for boston kind of two quarters ago you were talking about kind of  billion to  billion and then it sort of moved to the  billion range and now  billion so when you look at that… ian coughlan thats the end of it  billion its bought out thats the number robin margaret farley and well so that… ian coughlan with a big contingency robin margaret farley and that was one question it was like is that final now but then also i think originally when you were talking about the project in vegas you were talking about a  billion budget is it sort of just a coincidence that the boston budget  that the vegas budget has gone done by the amount that boston budget has gone up is there anything to be read into that stephen wynn no it is a coincidence i tried very hard to explain why were handling the lagoon and the golf course the way we are and it was function of the ebitda certainty of phase one and the fact that we have so many options about what to do with the rest of the real estate on the waterfront that we want to see it first so  and the fact that that budget went down is a coincidence entirely the fact that the budget went up in massachusetts is a function of the surprisingly expensive bids we got from the subs i did change scope about eight months ago wasnt it matt matt maddox yes stephen wynn when we added more convention space i added more convention space on our property but it really  the gmp is at  billion and we were surprised for a couple of hundred million  to  matt matt maddox yes stephen wynn and we took a lot of bids and we went back and valueengineered because we didnt like the bids and we cleaned it up some more but boy ill tell you building in boston is expensive the subs have a lot of work they  we were crossbidding four and five different outfits on things like hvac electrical and plumbing and those numbers stood and its not just that its a union town because weve always built union buildings out here its the building trades are busy in boston and the cost of living is high in boston now thats a gate that swings both ways the cost of living is high in boston so wager levels are higher in boston but so is the average income in that magnificent metropolitan area its matter of fact the average income in the metropolitan area the fourpointeightornine million people that we are going to serve by ourselves so to speak is one of the highest per cap metropolitan areas in the united states if not the highest is it the highest matt matt maddox i dont know its one of the highest stephen wynn yes i mean weve never been in a city where the per cap income is as high as this not to mention nonstop air service from every single capital in the world to logan airport including hong kong beijing and shanghai geneva london mexico city buenos aires rio de janeiro tokyo seoul nonstop service to boston on a daily basis and weve never been in a city where were  minutes away where our hotel is  minutes away from an international airport with nonstop service from every capital on earth the first time for us weve always had to go get the folks in la and fly them over here in one of our jets but not this time were  minutes from logan airport i was there last week and thats how long it took me to get there and were  minutes from boston garden were in everett which is its own city with its own mayor a wonderful fellow and a wonderful city council but we are surrounded like an island by boston and its suburbs and on the edge of our property if you take three steps to the right youre in boston you take three steps to the left youre in everett and thats on three sites so were an island in that metropolitan area and happy to be there so it was coincidence it was a coincidence robin margaret farley okay thanks for the color thanks operator your next question comes from the line harry curtis with instinet daniel scott adam hi this is dan adam for harry curtis thanks for taking our question in macau looking at demand trend so far in april we are wondering if youre seeing a continuation of the strong  market growth that we saw in february and march follow through into april thanks stephen wynn well i dont know that we want to get into the next quarter ian coughlan no i dont think so were usually  its too early right now to be talking about the second quarter stephen wynn yes i think  i dont think that  i dont want to give people false expectations or anything like that so i think well be off that little concern but it was throughout daniel scott adam yes fine thank you stephen wynn dan is there another question operator your next question comes from the line of adam trivison with gabelli  company adam trivison hi thanks for taking my question steve can you give us your thoughts on the opportunity in japan and how youre approaching it in the context of your other investment opportunities stephen wynn could you repeat the question please adam trivison could you talk about the opportunity in japan and how youre approaching it in the context of all your investment opportunities stephen wynn matthew maddox can handle that and ill take all the… matt maddox sure so weve been monitoring japan for the last decade pretty carefully and for us right now this is actually a really exciting time it seems like all the right people and corporations are now focused on moving the ir implementation go forward in the next  months and the wynn focus on quality and what we do we think fits quite well with what japan is looking for so we are ramping up our efforts and really excited about the opportunity adam trivison okay great thats helpful and then the second one maurice you touched on this a little bit but in las vegas revpar was very strong first quarter can you talk a little about the way that played out over the quarter i guess particularly with a lot of it in march or whats the pace in there maurice wooden well really january and march so we got out of the gate very strong with ces and then there was from a convention and transient segment the entire quarter had a lot of strength obviously in march we didnt deal with the easter holiday and the passover holiday that occurred in  in march this year its in april so there was a shifting of that holiday period and then we had one unique group that comes every three years conagg conexpo in march and then also helped the city with citywide event ph a great group to have and so but really the strength is both transient and convention so really then translates into cash revenue adam trivison okay great well thank you very much operator your next question comes from shaun kelley with bank of america shaun kelley hi good afternoon maybe i just wanted to go back to the ramp up at cotai and i guess its probably a little bit difficult to analyze given that january and february were so impacted by chinese new year but when you kind of look back at the quarter did you see i guess some continued sequential ramp up at least across the quarter in some of the key metrics or kpis that you guys are watching at the property ian coughlan yes business has been growing in all segments nongaming and gaming it hasnt been outstanding in one particular area shaun kelley okay thanks for that ian and then i guess just as a followup is  we talked a little bit about the promotional environment in the mass and premium mass segments which appears still competitive in cotai but could you talk a little bit about the vip business either what youre seeing from junkets right now some of the interest in either extending credit from your standpoint adding rooms things like that because it doesnt feel like many other people in the market right now are actually targeting this business from a competitive standpoint ian coughlan with the type of product that we provide and service in the marketplace lends itself to being very attractive to junkets an interesting stat is that when macau and wynn palace combine junket volume was  times our junket volume for the  days prior to the opening of wynn palace so we are very attractive to junket operators there are types of players our direct program continues to grow between the two properties and in addition to being a great place for mass players wynn palace and wynn macau lead in terms of vip service and quality shaun kelley thanks and maybe just a last one ian are you seeing i guess new junkets or new subjunkets like some of the signs of i guess early credit formation are we kind of at that part in the cycle there ian coughlan so we certainly  weve seen junkets that have been quieter rebuild a lot of their business ciaran referred to one junket thats grown from two tables to ten we also  thats downtown macau at wynn palace we have a new very strong junket starting in a couple of days so theres continued interest from existing junkets and want to grow their business matt maddox shaun its matt one thing i think youll appreciate is were generating about  million of vip revenue a day between the two properties which is similar to the   levels with less than half of the advances so this is not a credit driven liquidity revenue like weve seen in the past it feels very healthy shaun kelley thats great matt and then maybe if i could just one more on that would be you sense a similar type of environment for the junkets themselves are they extending as much credit or are the customers more flush with cash as well stephen wynn its a tough question to answer but its an interesting question shaun kelley yes i guess maybe you could see it little bit in the collections right in the past its been as short as  days sometimes that period lengthens out a little bit probably the only way to give any sense really matt maddox you know what i would say is when you talk to the junket operators theyll tell you their liquidity is much better and what that means is theyre collecting more of their debts than they were in the past on top of raising additional funds so theyre not getting the liquidity from the operators theyre getting it from better collections and from outside investors so i think thats a good indication that the health of the junket market is much better than it was stephen wynn its such a good question im going to ask some of the junket of that i didnt thought to ask them ph shaun kelley great stephen wynn indiscernible were not given… craig billings there is a general sentiment in the market at among the junket operators that they are managing to collect on debt thats owed to them and theyre able to put it back into the market shaun kelley perfect thank you very much everyone operator and there are no additional questions at this time stephen wynn well thank you very much everybody talk to you again in  days or so appreciate your

in the great war tells the remarkable story of brentwood and its surrounding areas from the outbreak of the great war to the longawaited the peace of  the presence of war was never far away from brentwood which had its fair share of military hospitals during the great war fortythree local graves commemorate the young soldiers who were patients of nearby waverly barracks hospital but died from their war wounds at least eighteen other war memorials and rolls of honour dotted around the district highlight just how important village life and a parish existence were back then when on a sunday everybody dressed up and went to church from each of these locations the individual stories of some of the men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for king and country are closely looked at to outline the sacrifices they made and why as the war progressed local military tribunals became more and more utilized here young men could attempt to obtain a certificate of exemption from military servicesome of the men were conscientious objectors some were genuine whose families would be met with hardship if their men left to fight overseas some worked in munitions factories and were already doing their bit for the war effort and others simply just didnt want to fight unique primary resources provide a true picture of what life was like in wartime brentwood as the town is looked a through the eyes of the local press the book reveals a strange combination of people deeply affected by wartime restrictions and their relentless struggle to achieve the normality of everyday life amongst the madness that
