lines between independent craft beer and the brands owned by the megabreweranheuserbusch denies thisbut myers’ decision illustrates an ongoing conflict between big beer and those in the craft camp now some craft breweries in nebraska and around the country are pushing harder to distinguish themselves from the craft names owned by the megabrewers adding a new seal to their beer labels marking the product as “independent craft”“it actually is a hot topic right now” said tom wilmoth president of the nebraska craft brewers guild and cofounder of lincoln’s zipline brewing co the big brewery acquisitions he said have “created some concern on the part of small independent brewers — that are not under that flagship corporation — that there would be market confusion”in may anheuserbusch announced that it had acquired north carolinabased wicked weed brewing rolling it into a stable of craft and import brands the company calls its “high end” the group includes names such as chicago’s goose island brewery seattle’s elysian brewing co and colorado’s breckenridge brewerylast summer millercoors the nation’s secondlargest brewer acquired three craft brands texas’ revolver brewing oregon’s hop valley brewing co and georgia’s terrapin beer co the company added the brands to its craft and import arm tenth and blake beer cocurrently anheuserbusch “has partnerships” with 0 american craft breweries said gemma hart vice president of communications for the beer companyand far from hiding its affiliation with these brands she said the company has “made  vocal announcements in both local communities and nationally whenever we have formed a new craft partnership these announcements have resulted in hundreds of media articles with broad reach across the country”but the acquisitions have resulted in slower growth for the craft beer business according to the boulder coloradobased brewers association a nonprofit craft brewing trade organization once a brewery is acquired by a major beer maker the association no longer counts its output toward that of the overall craft beer marketthis summer the association adopted a seal meant to be added to members’ product labels certifying the beer inside as “independent craft” to meet the association’s definition of a craft brewer a brewery must use traditional ingredients must produce  million barrels or fewer per year and must have less than  percent ownership by a member of the alcohol industry that is not a craft brewerthe new seal according to the brewers association aims to “elevate small and independent craft breweries” as they enter the next phase of the market on tuesday a counter on the association’s website reported that more than  brewing companies had adopted the seal“not only do craft brewers have passion on their side” the brewers association said “but their core customers clearly desire more transparency in the market”zipline plans to roll out labels featuring the seal in the near future wilmoth saidbill baburek owner of omahabased infusion brewing co said his brewery also plans to incorporate the seal onto its packaging over the next year“we feel like being independent and only local are two of the biggest marketing tools behind our product” baburek saidwatching the big companies take over smaller craft breweries can be disheartening he said“if you sell to one of the big guys the independents will have to fight even harder for a tap handle or shelf space in a liquor store” he said “it makes it tough”so the seal he said is an important step for smaller craft breweriesthe seal according to the brewers association isn’t meant to imply the beer inside is “good” while the big brewers’ beer is “bad” it is simply meant to be a signal to the beer buyers that their money is going back into the local community wilmoth said“you know who’s brewing the beer and where they’re buying their ingredients there’s no mystery to it” he saidand if you ask myers of the happy raven that’s the way nebraskans like ithe wasn’t worried when he made the decision to quit selling anheuserbusch products he said as a craft beer bar the standard domestics — bud light and budweiser — made up a small percentage of the happy raven’s overall salesmyers said he doesn’t expect to hear many complaints until football season when husker fans on their way to memorial stadium might stop in to order the familiar fare“we have enough options to where people can still try many different things and we can steer them in a direction to something they like” he saidmyers hasn’t heard of other bars in omaha or lincoln following his lead that was never his intention anyway he said“i don’t care what other bars do” he said “it’s just where do i want my money to go i don’t want it to go to a place that
