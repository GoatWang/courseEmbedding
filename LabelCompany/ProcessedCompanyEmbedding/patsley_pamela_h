our financial operations over the past year which allows for a seamless transition into his new role this appointment is well deserved im very excited for the future of moneygram with alex and larry in their new roles along with the leadership of our very strong management team and of course all the dedicated and talented people at this great company now on the impressive results for the third quarter which show that our strategies are oncourse and were doing what we said we would do our results for the third quarter demonstrate the consistent execution of the strategic objectives we outlined at the beginning of the year we delivered positive constant currency revenue growth and in september we returned to transaction growth in ustous sends our focus on a seamless customer experience through our innovative selfservice solutions like moneygramcom kiosks mobile solutions and account deposit continues to attract new customers to our brand while driving significant growth in money transfer revenue and transactions moneygram is focused on expanding our global reach and embracing robust emerging technologies that bridge the digital and cash world utilizing our selfservice solutions and agent network this hybrid model provides our customers around the world with the power to not only transact whenever and however they choose but also to have a direct interaction through moneygram our global footprint continues to expand with our services now available in over  physical locations with  locations added in the quarter as well as adding access to millions of bank accounts and mobile wallets during the quarter network growth in the quarter was led by additions in key emerging markets including china africa and latin america we also reopened our services in greece with receives beginning late in third quarter and send transactions resuming in october our focus remains on highquality agents and productive locations we have strong brand recognition in more than  countries and most importantly this continues to grow with positive positioning in the minds of our customers to complement our physical presence and attract new customers to our brand were harnessing the power of technology in the money transfer business with our suite of innovative selfservice solutions our selfservice business had an absolutely outstanding quarter and significantly accelerated its growth rate in fact money transfer transactions grew an impressive  and revenue grew  we now generate  of our money transfer transactions and  of our money transfer revenue from selfservice solutions on an annualized basis selfservice solutions generate over  million in revenue as you recall our reimagined moneygramcom launched in june we are extremely pleased with the enhanced functionality and aesthetics of the new site as are our customers this easytouse platform helped attract over  new active customers in the quarter which is a substantial growth from previous quarters our first priority when we launched was to focus on that customer experience and design a solution from a customers perspective we accomplished that with great new features and key differentiating services including our track a transfer tool and an instant ach option were embracing digital selfservice and we will continue to refine this solution including our credit management and risk metrics as we enter new markets and expand the product in the future moving forward we continue to expect strong growth from our selfservice business as the denominator on this business becomes larger and we begin to grow over successful launches of kiosks last year the rate of growth will begin to anniversary tougher comparisons importantly though we are clearly progressing on our goal to have  to  of money transfer revenue generated from selfservice channels in  additionally were driving more bill payment transactions through selfservice as a growing number of people are adopting selfservice at kiosks than online over  of our bill payment revenue originated from these sources we continue to invest in these differentiating strategic assets to ensure our longterm success now lets turn to just the overall strong results of our overall money transfer business total money transfer transaction growth this quarter accelerated to  compared to  growth in the second quarter of this year thats on the strength of our us outbound and nonus send our nonus send transactions grew  and our us outbound business grew  yearoveryear money transfer revenue increased  on a constant currency basis and increased  on a reported basis its important to call out that moneygram has significantly diversified to the point where  of our money transfer revenue now originates outside the united states and in this context our reported topline was impacted by the stronger dollar in terms of pricing we continue to see stability in the industry in fact during the third quarter pricing had virtually no impact on our results with the exception of course of the impact from lower us to us pricing implemented on october  of last year as you know geopolitical conditions can have a mixed impact on our business however one of the great things about our diversified model is that we can be on both sides of a trend for example economic conditions in russia have certainly been challenging lately but because of our global network during the quarter our russia sends declined while our receives into russia increased yielding slight total transaction growth compared to last year weve seen this before in other country payors such as spain and romania demonstrating the power of our business during the quarter we also saw strength in asia especially in china and the philippines now lets review our regional performance in more detail beginning with our nonus sends and us outbound together money transfer revenue from these two categories grew  on a constant currency basis in the quarter and accounted for  of total money transfer revenue this is strong growth on an already large base so first the nonus during the quarter nonus transaction growth was  and constant currency revenue growth was  in europe we signed a new agreement with vasp the leading retail distributor of media publications in portugal which will expand our services to their large network of retail partners we launched our services with gondural  which provides us with immediate entry into the important retail markets in turkey prior to that agreement our service was only available through banks in turkey during the quarter we launched a new account deposit service with bank of china where we continue to see the rapid adoption of selfservice solutions overall we posted excellent results outside the us accelerating from an already strong growth rate last quarter our us outbound remittance business continued to show steady growth with significant increases in sends to latin america and africa transactions and revenue grew  us to latin america was bolstered by key renewals in mexico including coppel a leading retailer with over  locations we also extended relationships with important partners in el salvador along with a new agreement with cotacao one of brazils largest currency exchange houses were growing throughout africa by forming strategic relationships with mobile network operators with banks post offices and retailers all to bring added convenience to our customers as weve discussed throughout the year in the digital space we are expanding our mobile wallet partnership in the third quarter we launched vodacoms mpesa in tanzania which adds access to millions of mobile wallets as we did last quarter with econet in zimbabwe we also added two key partners in kenya including the official post office adding to our growing list of national post offices around the world now our us to us business represented  of total money transfer transactions and  of money transfer revenue in the quarter were attracting higher dollar transactions as customers rely on our trusted brands for their most important and valuable transaction and were very pleased with the repositioning of our us business walmart represented  of total company revenue in the quarter we worked closely with walmart on a number of new initiatives throughout this year including the launch of cash to account deposit service which just went live this month this means a moneygram customer at walmart can now send cash to bank accounts in china india mexico philippines and millions of mobile wallet as you know or certainly you may ask we continue to work on a new agreement with walmart and thus we filed an k announcing the extension of our existing agreements this quarter overall our strategic focus of growing in emerging markets along with our innovative technological capabilities led to great results in the third quarter and strongly positions us for future success ill now turn it over to alex to walk you through the detailed financials w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer great thanks pam building on the momentum thats started in the second quarter we delivered solid third quarter results our money transfer business returned to doubledigit transaction growth and total company constant currency revenue growth accelerated additionally we returned to positive operating income and adjusted free cash flow in the quarter while still investing in future growth initiatives total revenue for the quarter was  million growing  on a reported basis on a constant currency basis revenue increased  a basispoint improvement as compared to the second quarter as pam outlined increased growth from nonus sends along with ustous send volumes propelled this improvement gross margin in the quarter was  about flat as compared to the prior year driven by a small improvement in our money transfer commission rate we anticipate gross margin to be roughly flat in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter which is consistent with our fullyear outlook compensation and benefit costs were  million in the quarter an increase of  million on a reported basis as a result of higher achievement on performance metrics partially offset by good results from our cost takeout and restructuring efforts on an adjusted basis compensation benefit costs were flat sequentially compared to the second quarter looking ahead to the fourth quarter we anticipate compensation and benefit costs to increase about  million on a yearoveryear basis as last years fourth quarter reported numbers benefited from a net reversal of stockbased compensation costs and lower performance based compensation on an adjusted basis compensation and benefit costs in the fourth quarter of  should be in line with our third quarter adjusted costs transaction and operations support costs were  million on a reported basis which was a slight reduction in expense on a yearoveryear basis this favorability was largely due to the timing of marketing expenses and reduced spend on the compliance enhancement program and reduced spend on our global restructuring efforts partially offset by increased loss provision associated with our new instant ach product on an adjusted basis transaction and operations support costs were  million down sequentially as compared to the second quarter but up about  million as compared to the prior year reflecting our continued investments in selfservice solutions and increased utilization of outsourced service providers looking ahead to the fourth quarter we anticipate transaction and operations support costs on an adjusted basis to increase about  million as compared to the third quarter primarily driven by the timing of marketing initiatives on a reported basis this years fourth quarter transaction and operations yearoveryear cost comparison was showing  million benefit as last years fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a onetime legal settlement expense our third quarter pretax profit was  million and net income was  million marking a return to profitability adjusted diluted earnings per share was  a  increase yearoveryear third quarter adjusted ebitda was  million and i am pleased to say that in september the company returned to positive adjusted ebitda growth adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was  this was a basispoint improvement from the second quarter driven by increased revenue from the money transfer business and the timing of certain marketing initiatives partially offset by incremental investments in selfservice solutions now as we looking at the segments the third quarter global funds transfer segment revenue was  million on an adjusted basis operating margin for this segment was  in the financial paper products segment total revenue was  million and operating income was  million investment revenue in the third quarter was  million looking at the balance sheet and cash flow higher gross profit and lower signing bonus payments led to a free cash flow of  million or  of revenue in the quarter agent signing bonus payments were  million and cash payments for capital expenditures were  million mostly related to the global transformation program we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million up  million from last quarter as mentioned in our earnings press release this morning our outlook for the year remains unchanged now before i turn it back to pam id just like to add to her comments about larrys appointment as our next cfo larry brings an incredible financial services background and a high level of enthusiasm to his new role its truly been a great pleasure working with larry over the past several years and i couldnt be more excited to have him as our cfo for the next phase of moneygrams journey and with that ill turn it back to pam for her closing thoughts pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer thanks alex while you can see there are a lot of great things taking place at moneygram i believe we have the most capable management team in the industry leading moneygram through exciting developments in technology and in product offerings all derived and designed from our customers point of view we are successfully bridging the digital and cash world through our hybrid business models were investing in a worldclass compliance engine that is not only core to our business but a true competitive advantage that we can leverage in the future im so proud of the entire team at moneygram everything they do each and every day is truly what sets us apart were very well positioned to continue our momentum with that thank you as always for your interest in moneygram and ill now turn it over to the operator and begin our qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you and well take our first question from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli  william blair  co llc thank you good morning the doubledigit – you say – reiterate the doubledigit revenue the top and ebitda growth in the fourth quarter now are you – when you talk – the revenue are you talking constant currency revenue growth or reported revenue growth and doesnt money transfer revenues typically increase a little bit seasonally in a fourth quarter pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer we are talking constant currency as called out in our press release and yes fourth quarter typically is a higher volume quarter so that – if you just track as you know bob from following us for years as weve grown in a more diversified way less reliant just on us there are lot of other holidays and seasonal things so the drama of that fourth quarter isnt as great as it was say six years ago robert napoli  william blair  co llc okay and then do you – in  do you expect to be able to continue the doubledouble pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer well were not giving  guidance today as always we kind of give the next years guidance when we do fourth quarter results and then we lay out that year for you robert napoli  william blair  co llc okay and then the walmart relationship obviously you extended it three months and if nothing is announced by yearend it automatically rolls over a year or you must be close to announcing a longterm agreement if you extended three months would be – is that fair to assume pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer well i think everything we have to say is kind of out there in the k so i dont want to get into any kind of tricked on the communication it is the agreement that we have in place and the extension are there for you to see and i would just say we have a very robust relationship with walmart i called out some of the new services that were launching we work closely with them we really like value and appreciate and importantly because i think were so aligned on our approach to the customer and its really all about what does the customer want ease of service so were very aligned on those points as we continue to work on initiatives robert napoli  william blair  co llc and last question on the balance sheet i mean how do you think about the balance sheet strength today and the need to pay down debt versus investing for growth or even potentially doing some smaller tuckin acquisitions w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah no its a great question certainly our cash position strengthened a bit in the quarter which is positive i think our leverage were maintaining a comfortable ratio there and so i certainly think as we look ahead debt paydown will be an important factor to consider as we look at cash flow and excess cash but certainly with everything underway right now the global transformation program reducing our costs getting the compliance program right completing our obligations under the dpa investing in new technologies is pretty paramount for the company to position us for longterm success i think weve done a very nice job over the last several years really balancing our needs from a balance sheet perspective and well continue to do that robert napoli  william blair  co llc great thank you and congratulations larry on your promotion lawrence angelilli  treasurer  senior vpcorporate finance thanks bob pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer thanks operator and well take our next question from james schneider with goldman sachs james edward schneider  goldman sachs  co good morning thanks for taking my question obviously good traction in the online programs at this point can you maybe talk about what kind of marketing youve done against – to drive that growth and specifically as you go forward as the online continues to grow should we expect a corresponding uptick in the marketing expenses tied to online w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah the online business has performed extremely well we are very very excited about all thats been happening with the – what we call moneygramnet the new launch of our product and the experience online reimagined and were very happy with that we continue to work through a number of learnings with it obviously the launch of the instant ach has been a learning for us and thats something we continue to look at from a credit metrics and scoring perspective and well continue to learn as we go forward we like where the business is headed and the customers that were attracting to the service its actually i would probably say we have spent a little bit less on marketing than i think we initially intended to i think the product has to some degree largely sold itself which is a real testament to the team and the efforts theyve put in in building that product but we have a lot of ideas a lot of initiatives underway in terms of how we can continue to build momentum in that business how marketing becomes important but its interesting as you look at marketing in the online space its not just about that marketing for the online business its about getting that balance between your walkin customers and your online customers all of which are now connected through online media formats and our most valuable customers are actually those customers that not only use the walkin business but also utilize the online service and so were really looking at the balance of how marketing evolves over time james edward schneider  goldman sachs  co thats helpful and then just as a followup im wondering if you could kind of directionally address the compliance spending from kind of this quarter forward and how would you expect that to trend over the next few quarters and into  w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah thats a really good question and again another one thats – its been an interesting balance over the last couple of years certainly this is a very large scale initiative there are a lot of moving parts associated with that investment and as you look at the amount of spend left our estimate i believe last quarter was in the neighborhood of  million or so we spent about  million this quarter and well – right now that seems to be our best outlook but as i mentioned before getting that system done getting our compliance completely revamped to the way we want it being a leader in compliance is so critical for us and not just for compliance with our gpa but also for relationships with banks and global initiatives around the world so well continue to invest until we get it right but we feel good about the outlook we have right now james edward schneider  goldman sachs  co so a few more quarters of  million range before we tail off w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah  million – more or less i think as we look at some launches in the first quarter of next year the spend may go up as we have some more modules getting ready to come due at that time james edward schneider  goldman sachs  co thank you operator well go next to sara gubins with bank of america sara rebecca gubins  bofa merrill lynch hi thanks good morning the pricing really does seem quite stable in the market im wondering in online if youre seeing anything that would mean more pricing pressure and broadly as you look into  i know its early but as you look into  do you see anything that makes you think that the broader pricing environment would change pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer ill just take the latter part of that question first because i think its good context we dont see anything right now and i think you heard from others it feels pretty good where things are i think a lot of different corridors particularly ustous that stood out as a bit of an outlier from its  pricing that is now all flushed through the system and of course given  or whatever plus corridors there is always tweaks in pricing a little bit up a little bit down and adjustments but i think order of magnitude from the direction of your question sara i dont think see anything we feel pretty good about that with regard to the online perspective i think that also has been relatively stable i think there is a lot of – a lot more noise about pricing in the online but when you look at it really i think thats from some of the more niche players or those that are brand new or startups but theyre really not offering the same service so when you tear that apart i think theres more noise than what there really is real pricing pressure at the moment we feel very good about the value proposition we have for our customers what we offer how they can transact and what it means on the receive side for them as well sara rebecca gubins  bofa merrill lynch okay great and then continuing in online could you talk about your experience so far with instant ach you mentioned thats a learning experience any color you could give us on loss rate so far and how youre managing that w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah no absolutely the experience has been interesting not just from getting the product up and running but also looking at which customers are using it for which corridors certainly we have seen – as we continue to adjust our credit metrics weve seen an uptick in loss rates associated with that product we had to play with some limit changes on transactions first time transactions versus repeat transactions et cetera and well continues to tweak those metrics but so far were pleased with the consumer adoption of the products and the potential for it longer term but again it is continuing to learn and get those credit metrics exactly right as we begin to score new customers coming in and looking to utilize that service sara rebecca gubins  bofa merrill lynch great and then just last question on commissions it looks like youre getting some leverage this year maybe with mix shift away from walmart how should we think about agents commission expense next year would you expect to see more leverage there w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer again well get into some more details longer term but i think right now that you know the trend has been relatively favorable and thats – from looking at the fourth quarter the business wont flip overnight as we roll into the first quarter so i think that trend will be there but exactly how that plays out through all of  well talk more about that later sara rebecca gubins  bofa merrill lynch okay thanks a lot pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer thanks w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer thanks operator and our next question comes from kartik mehta with northcoast research kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc good morning pam and alex pam i wanted to ask you youve talked a lot about the self service revenue and now it represents i think you said  of money transfer revenue as that revenue grows does that change the model at all for moneygram or how you manage the business pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer well i think – certainly everything kind of changes how we manage and look at our business and if you just look back over the last whatever years you can see how weve continued to adjust to opportunities to ensure were driving maximum growth and keeping the customer at the forefront i think whats really great though and we called it out is – alex called out that our most valuable customer is those that uses both channels for us are our most profitable customer we separately called out how many are coming in as new to moneygram via moneygramcom then maybe that more the entry point and then they can see that the physical point might be interesting another time we think we are organized very well between kind of a mix of the geographies with strong leadership from the product and marketing organization aligned against kind of the geographic leadership because some of this is kind of channel driven some of it is geography driven and we dont want any walls around it it has to be seamless does it go to a mobile wallet does it go to a bank account is it picked up at a physical point of presence thats for the customer to decide and thats the great power of our brand our network and our product offerings kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc i guess pam i was more wondering from the cost structure does the cost structure change at the organization because self service becomes a bigger part of revenue or does it need to become much much bigger for that to have an impact on the company pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer well i think it does need to be – were investing so were going to continue to invest theres no question from a commission perspective thinking about another question recently asked mobile wallet account deposits some of those things continue to drive commissions down so thats a good aspect if you will as well as as we continue to go through the refinement on the risk analytics and metrics on the dotcom origination over time that will also continue to be a very efficient source of sim  transaction so that mix on the commission and the cost side will continue to evolve but were not really projecting major step function changes in the immediate future and most importantly were going to continue to invest and expand kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and alex i want to get your thoughts on free cash flow for the year maybe gaap free cash flow just to get an idea about what the cash position of the company might be by the end of the year what would your expectations be for gaap free cash flow for  versus  w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer well versus  i mean ill anticipate it will be down i think if we can get back to some spend – let me – sorry let me backup the drivers of the increase right in the cash flow have been obviously less profit growth and then certainly driven by increased capex spend particularly on cep and the restructuring program and then increased signing bonuses as weve been in a cycle here of renewing and signing some pretty large agents and so when i look at an adjusted basis it should be about flat i think the drivers of the variation on a gaap basis will be where we end up just on the compliance program or on the restructuring program we certainly have a good feel for where the spend needs to be but again these projects are fairly large scale and fluid and so particularly on the cep program well make right investments as we go forward but i would anticipate it to be about flat on an adjusted basis kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc so maybe on a gaap basis negative then just because of the irs tax payment is that fair w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah thats fair for sure yeah kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc okay thank you very much i appreciate it w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes from danyal hussain with morgan stanley danyal hussain  morgan stanley  co llc hi pam and alex thanks for taking my question just looking into i guess transaction growth of  which is comparable again to where you were before last april but pam you pointed out that september you still saw some acceleration so just i guess how is it tracking through october and could you perhaps provide the transaction growth figure in september if possible pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer im sorry the last w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yes can you just quickly repeat that danyal hussain  morgan stanley  co llc so – pam you mentioned the transaction growth was pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer yeah danyal hussain  morgan stanley  co llc it was still accelerating ustous for example w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer right danyal hussain  morgan stanley  co llc so just companywide how has that tracked through how did it look in september and how is it tracking in october pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer well were not going to give early looks into fourth quarter i think we said all were going to say is its out there september was a good month danyal hussain  morgan stanley  co llc okay and then i dont know if youve provided this before but how much of the selfservices volume would you say is incremental and then question was sort of brought up before but is the commission structure any different for transactions originated versus paid out through a kiosk pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer yeah when you look at all of our selfservice options some are on the send side some are receive and some could be both particularly like kiosks its hard to measure right which one is totally incremental but we feel if you look just particularly where we track new active customers on moneygramcom most are new so ill just – but again were seeing people come back in theyve been with us before but maybe not for  months they come back they come back through a new channel allinall we feel very very positive about the mix of more customer utilization of our longstanding customers using different options as well as the avenue to attract new consumers because of convenience i mean the whole thing from a consumer perspective from a customer is convenience ease of use and solving and meeting their needs suzanne rosenberg  vice president investor relations we have some other analysts on the line so were going to need to move on operator and well take our next question from tientsin huang with jpmorgan tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc thanks just a couple of questions just on the restructuring side sorry if i missed it can you just give us an update there where are you in the costcutting versus goals w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah no its a good question the restructuring costs for the broad restructuring program associated with what wed call the global transformation program has largely come to an end we had some incremental costs in the quarter around a few things out and get that really ramped down you saw a little bit of uptick in some spend broadly categorized as restructuring and that was related to some restructuring initiatives across western europe which we took advantage now of our poland operations to downsize some functions in a few of our western european operations so when you net it together we feel really good about where we are from a cost perspective as a company we love that were moving a lot of our expenses internationally to match where the revenue is really starting to flow from were getting some good leverage on that and well continue to look for opportunities as we go forward tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc okay good just one more just on the – heard a lot of comments on the commissions but just on the bonus front just wanted to clarify anything to consider on the signing bonus front and are there any other renewals aside from walmart to pay attention to the next couple quarters w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer no not particularly tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc okay just wanted to make sure thank you w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah operator and well take our next question from rayna kumar with evercore isi rayna kumar  evercore group llc you mentioned compliance costs may be up next year do you anticipate excluding compliance cost from your adjusted numbers going forward since it appears to be an ongoing cost of running your business w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer well we never exclude ongoing cost of compliance from our numbers what we exclude is the outsized incremental spend that were putting toward rebuilding our underlying compliance system what we call the compliance enhancement program that i think we have talked a lot about in prior quarters it was laid out to be a twoyear threeyear program i think weve said on the last call that we were in the neighborhood of about  million spend left in that program which would take us into  and ramp down and consistent with prior quarters we will continue to adjust those costs underlying that which we dont call out as an organization is our ongoing compliance costs all the costs that we incur everyday within our teams and our functions and our ongoing system costs all the filings that we do all the regulatory reporting all of that is just in our business from a broad standpoint i would say that we anticipate compliance costs will continue to go up theres a lot of scrutiny globally of all financial service providers banks included so well continue to invest in compliance get our overhaul program complete and then well continue to have ongoing compliance costs which we do not adjust those are in the numbers rayna kumar  evercore group llc got it could you quantify net pricing changes in the quarter and also discuss your pricing strategies for  for crossborder money transfer pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer yeah we called out that pricing – putting aside the third quarter still felt the full impact of our reset on ustous we implemented it october  so the third quarter felt the full impact of that putting that ustous aside we said pricing had no impact i think in the second quarter we called out for you pricing impact that its about  so we generally have been saying pricing we expect is going to be on average  to  it was actually below that in the third quarter i think rayna theres no reason for us to kind of come out at this point with anything different than a historical look and actual experience which is that  to  rayna kumar  evercore group llc okay that pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer thats a blending from a gazillion corridors up down and sideways all around the world rayna kumar  evercore group llc thats very helpful and if you can just call out billpay transaction growth through the quarter thank you w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah billpay transactions i believe were down  thats an interesting business again it seems like the neverending saga of how do you get that back to growth within that business theres some real pockets of growth across a lot of our business but when you look at some of those consequence payments the auto loans and mortgages it tends to be fairly volatile and we continue to see kind of pluses and minuses there so weve had some good quarters and some bad ones with that business but we are seeing a lot of growth in the online space for that business a good transition in that direction we continue to put some new products through new billers through and well continue to reposition and work on that business rayna kumar  evercore group llc thank you pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer thanks operator well go next to david scharf with jmp securities david m scharf  jmp securities llc thank you good morning most of mine have been answered but pam i did have a question on commissions in terms of how should we be thinking about this secularly going out a number of years and specifically there is always competition obviously between large global networks for those prime locations when those contracts come up for renewal but is there any sense that the increase of alternative channels and particularly as those channels arguably become a much bigger part of the industry that youre seeing less pricing leverage arguably among very large agents and im not discussing walmart here but just globally im trying to understand if there is a secular decline in commission rates over the next five years six years pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer i think its more of – what i feel more comfortable saying – i mean i think thats possible but certainly the mix of our business will potentially yield a lower commission rate because of the blending out of different ways to receive or catch the money into an account on to a mobile wallet sending from online whether its through our own virtual agent network or directly from moneygramcom so i think that will have more impact on kind of the blending of that downward david m scharf  jmp securities llc got it but obviously we dont want to get ahead of ourselves and concluding the industry is going to shift materially thats pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer no i dont think its the time now well first never good to get ahead of oneself and i certainly dont think now is the time david m scharf  jmp securities llc okay pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer for that bold of a statement but maybe this time next year david m scharf  jmp securities llc okay more on the granular on the guidance front first i know youre not prepared to discuss  in any detail im just wondering directionally is there anything on the horizon that would materially alter your effective tax rate next year would you be able to comment on that pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer well i dont think it can go up  w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer materially also its always an interesting question i do believe that we have a number of initiatives i know we have a number of initiatives underway looking at again organizationally how were structured longer term again very important for us that we begin to match all of our expenses to where the revenue is generated and so we certainly have a number of things underway internally that i do believe over time will lead to a lower tax rate as one of the outcomes of that program theres nothing i can particularly call out today we do try to be opportunistic this quarter for example benefited from a onetime discrete item related to some rd benefit that weve gotten from a lot of our investments in technologies so when we can we look to get the rate as low as possible but longer term yes were focused on it we know its an issue but more important we know its an opportunity for us so were going to look at that and continue to push forward david m scharf  jmp securities llc okay and shifting to the fourth quarter in ustous obviously youre lapping the walmart events of last year is it safe to say based on the q performance that we should be looking at a minimum sort of midsingle digit transaction growth in the fourth quarter of this year pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer for us david m scharf  jmp securities llc recognizing the – for us to us pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer yeah we dont predict but your math is – generally works and just to be clear what were lapping in the fourth quarter is the reset of our own pricing not lapping any walmart per se were lapping that we reset prices october  so two months of the fourth quarter well have kind of a likeforlike rollover but october will still be kind of the lap of that david m scharf  jmp securities llc okay and just one last question sort of echoing the prior one regarding compliance spending as it relates to the actual enhancement program and maybe i just need a refresher looks like youve got another  million  million on that what is that i mean is it expense software development is it more bodies can you help us pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer no that – that – what were calling out is the enhanced spend or the spend for the compliance enhancement program is really more – i mean there are people involved in it whether it is systems development its software purchasing its working and integrating really as alex said the kind of recasting a new compliance engine w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer yeah i mean i would equate it largely just to have i think before to a large scale erp program or maybe to someone in the emergence space who is replatforming its literally our compliance system – our compliance engine hangs off of our transaction system all the transactions flow through it its an integral part of what we do and so its literally taking that out and replacing it with a new system but then its mapping it back to the current – changing all your process associated with it mapping it back putting the modules in place and a lot of what were trying to do is well which i think is adding the complexity to it and – but i think its going to benefit us greatly down the road is really taking a lot of what we do kind of in the back office and pushing a lot of it kind of forward so youre getting more intelligence in the frontend rather than some of the backend pieces its also speeding up transaction time and other ways of looking at consumer data agent data all these types of things so its a really exciting project its complex and obviously the downside of course is its expensive but it will benefit in the long term for sure david m scharf  jmp securities llc got it and has all of that been expensed or is there actually a fair amount w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer no a lot of thats been capitalized david m scharf  jmp securities llc yeah can you give us a sense of kind of i guess to date whats the expense versus the capitalized component there w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer when we follow up with you i can get you the exact number off the top of my head its been roughly  david m scharf  jmp securities llc got it okay thank you very much suzanne rosenberg  vice president investor relations thanks david operator i think we have time for one last question operator okay our last question comes from kevin mcveigh with macquarie kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc great thanks hey – just i wondered if you could give us a sense with xoom and paypal change now have you seen any change to the competitive environment particularly on the online side pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer we havent we dont really expect to see anything significant that has been announced for a long time xoom has been around for what  years  years now i mean i think if anything continues to broaden the awareness of availability of money transfer services online and so its good good for the industry kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc okay great ill follow up with you later on with my other ones thanks pamela h patsley  executive chairman  chief executive officer okay thanks w alexander holmes  executive vp chief operating  financial officer thanks kevin mcveigh  macquarie capital usa inc thanks pam pamela h patsley  executive chairman
