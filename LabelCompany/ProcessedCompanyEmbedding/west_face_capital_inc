highly qualified directors for election to the board of gran west face capital to nominate six highly qualified directors for election to the board of gran tierra energy inc apr    et from west face capital inc recommends replacing incumbent board which has presided over a more than  stock price decline since  calls for new strategy focused on core colombia properties and announces supportfor highly regarded oil and gas veteran gary guidry to lead gran tierra as ceo toronto april   cnw  west face capital inc west face whose managed funds beneficially own approximately  of gran tierra energy inc gran tierra nyse mkt gte tsx gte today sent a letter to the gran tierra board of directors announcing its intention to nominate six highly qualified director candidates for election to the board at the  annual meeting of shareholders scheduled for june   in the letter west face highlighted what it believes is gran tierras failed highrisk highcost exploration strategy in peru argentina and brazil and the destruction of more than half of the companys market value since the beginning of  all overseen by the current fourmember board of directors  west face also outlined its proposal for a new strategy focused on gran tierras core colombia properties to restore value for shareholders and voiced its support for gary guidry a highly regarded oil and gas executive with an outstanding track record of value creation as the right leader to assume the position of ceo of gran tierra west face is committed to fixing gran tierra and creating value on behalf of all shareholders said thomas dea partner of west face  we are putting forward a highlyqualified slate of independent directors including gary guidry who in our opinion are far better equipped than the incumbent board members to implement a new strategic direction for gran tierra and to take the steps we believe are urgently required for the company to get back on track and realize its full potential value the six west face nominees are nominee key qualifications robert b hodgins mr hodgins currently sits on the boards of altagas ltd enerplus corporation meg energy corp stonepoint energy inc and kicking horse

chairman and ceo of acetex corporation founding president and ceo of methanex corporation and is a former director of caracal energy inc peter dey                  mr dey is chairman of paradigm capital inc an investment dealer  he is a director of goldcorp inc and granite reit inc  formerly mr dey was chairman of the ontario securities commission chairman of morgan stanley canada senior partner with osler hoskin  harcourt llp chairman of the toronto stock exchange committee on corporate governance and a former director of caracal energy inc ronald royal           mr royal is a private businessman and serves on the boards of valeura energy inc and oando energy resources inc  mr royal is a professional engineer with more than  years of experience with imperial oil and exxonmobils international upstream affiliates  prior to his retirement in  he was president and general manager of esso exploration and production chad inc  he is a former director of caracal energy inc david p smith        mr smith is chairman of the board of superior plus corporation  he is a former managing partner of enterprise capital management inc an investment manager and is a former investment banker and energy research analyst   gary guidry             mr guidry is the prospective ceo of gran tierra   he is the former ceo at each of caracal energy inc orion oil  gas tanganyika oil company and calpine natural gas trust  he was named the oil council ceo of the year in  the letter sent today by west face to the gran tierra board follows april   the board of directors of gran tierra energy inc th avenue swcalgary albertacanada tr e dear sirs west face capital inc west face via funds we manage or advise west face funds intends to nominate six highly qualified candidates for election to gran tierra energy incs gran tierra board of directors at the annual meeting to be held on june    the new directors will have a mandate to replace the current interim ceo with gary guidry a highly regarded oil and gas executive with an outstanding track record of value creation in his four prior leadership roles as ceo the west face funds own approximately  of gran tierras outstanding common shares making us one of your largest shareholders if not the largest  west face has a mandate to take large core positions in companies in which we have conducted extensive research and where we believe we can assist in realizing longterm value for the benefit of all shareholders     we are taking these actions with gran tierra because we believe the current fourmember board with an average tenure of seven years has failed in its three most fundamental responsibilities adopting a strategy for value creation overseeing the proper allocation of capital and ensuring the company is led by the best possible ceo lack of proper oversight has resulted in significant destruction of the companys value since the beginning of  the current board has approved  billion in spending between acquisitions and capital expenditures  of this amount approximately  million was spent in peru argentina and brazil where there have been no appreciable new discoveries reserve additions or production growth  over the same period the share price has declined from  to  a  loss in market value per share  this dismal result was not due to declining oil prices – the share price had already fallen to  by july  in our opinion the board has been gambling on highrisk exploration using shareholders capital repeatedly and in the face of negative results while at the same time losing focus on its promising core colombian assets  for all of the capital deployed gran tierras core colombian assets still provide most of the companys production  the executive chairman has called these excursions outside of colombia elephant hunting  we call it engaging in highrisk highcost ventures in far less attractive locations while ignoring the benefits of developed infrastructure political stability and access to global energy markets in your existing core geographies  ineffectual governance and lack of accountability in our opinion the board did not have the proper expertise to oversee the prior ceo and has avoided accountability for this deficiency  on the day of the former ceos resignation in february the board hastily promoted the chairman jeffrey scott to executive chairman and raised the coo to interim president and ceo  there was no announcement of a ceo search  there has been no clear articulation of strategy then or now other than to be – in the executive chairmans words – opportunity reactive  we find the situation unacceptable mr scotts operating experience is limited to running a small private oil and gas company in western canada  he also continues to hold the title of executive chairman for another company and sits on several boards  the interim ceo who may one day expand his experience to be a suitable ceo candidate does not in our view have that experience today  we believe that mr guidrys experience by comparison is clearly superior having built exceptional value as ceo at four separate international oil and gas companies he led no coherent strategy we are undertaking these actions at a potentially important turning point for gran tierra  the company has approximately  million in cash no drawn debt and  million of capacity in its reservebased credit facility  in short it has  million of buying power as well as the ability to undertake a business combination for shares  in addition the company has attractive assets in colombia and an ability to grow through targeted spending on new lands through joint ventures or business combinations  with the right leadership we believe that gran tierra could become a very valuable company  alternatively in our opinion unless the history of poor governance and subpar management is fixed the company risks further squandering its underappreciated strategic position  we are not impressed by the executive chairmans articulation of strategy  here are statements from the q  investors conference call when asked about the companys strategy and planned use for its capital our emphasis added …and the timeline for the  million cash on the balance sheet i dont think we have one other than we intend to be opportunity reactive   jeffrey scott executive chairman now when i look at this at the world in general and the entire world is on sale so while were colombiaspecific right now and i think youre right to say that the moment peru is sort of on the backburner and brazil isnt also around but there are other opportunities around the world when the entire world is on sale   jeffrey scott executive chairman …but what ive challenged the management team is that we may take our geographic blinders off here and if we see a really compelling opportunity elsewhere maybe we have to look at it   jeffrey scott executive chairman we take this to mean there is a real risk that management and this board unconstrained by proper oversight will again fail to focus on gran tierras core operating areas in colombia and complete one or more illadvised business combinations that again destroys value for gran tierra shareholders bloated overhead costs gran tierra has excessive general and administrative ga expense as compared to its most similar peer companies  gran tierras ga was  per boe of production in   by comparison a subset of its peers had average ga of  per boe of production in  on the q  conference call jeffrey scott said gran tierras high costs were the result of high oil prices were a fairly high ga company and opex has been where it has been as a result of  oil  jeffrey scott executive chairman apart from finding this response to be a confusing approach to cost management we believe high operating costs are symptomatic of poor management and a culture lacking in accountability starting at the board misaligned interests between shareholders and directors since  secondary market purchases of gran tierras common stock by current insiders have totalled  total shares  in contrast the board saw fit to award the executive chairman  options and  restricted stock units rsus upon being appointed to his current position which also pays a base salary of  canadian dollars cash per year  in addition the board approved a socalled changeofcontrol payment equal to two times his base salary  the newly appointed lead director scott price has not purchased any gran tierra shares that we have been able to identify  all of the common shares he owns appear to have been obtained by way of the companys share exchange with solana resources in   in  he sold over half of his shares for gross proceeds of more than  million prior to the acquisition of petrolifera in early   the two other directors have very modest holdings by comparison gary guidry and members of his team have acquired in the open market approximately  million gran tierra common shares worth approximately  million – even before having the ability to influence the companys direction  this meaningful commitment from a prospective ceo is indicative of his seriousness and confidence in his abilities to create value for gran tierra shareholders west face proposes a refocused strategy west face believes gran tierra should reevaluate moneylosing initiatives in peru and brazil  it should refocus financial and management resources on colombia where it benefits from proven petroleum basins well developed infrastructure established markets and scale  the companys cost structure should be brought into line and accountability should be introduced into the organization to drive consistent value creation        refocus on colombia  gran tierra already has a wellestablished operating advantage in the putumayo basin with lowrisk opportunities for expansion in addition we believe there are many opportunities for value creation in the middle and lower magdalena basins as well as the llanos basin with a focus on proven basins within colombia we believe gran tierra is well positioned to create shareholder value through organic growth and smart acquisitions  the preponderance of the companys capital budget should be targeted to development with a small allocation to exploration  address cost structure   accountability starts at the board and with the ceo and binds the organization together with a common purpose  a competitive cost structure is the result of a wellrun exploration development and production company not the end in itself  gran tierras operating and capital efficiency will be optimized by refocusing strategy on development production and exploration in colombia improve capital allocation  gran tierra does not need to take betthefarm risks in frontier basins to build value  capital should be used primarily to appraise and develop attractive assets it already owns  over the last seven years while gran tierras attention was not focused on colombia a number of other companies have successfully undertaken lowerrisk exploration in proven basins within colombia  we believe there is still considerable value to be built in colombia including in open lands and from joint venture partnerships and possible business combinations  but if attractive projects are not identified in the future capital should be returned to shareholders tax efficiently by way of share repurchases  west face proposes a newly reconstituted board and new management west face believes new leadership is required  the board of directors should be renewed with highly qualified and experienced individuals  the board then should assume its mandate and engage gary guidry to lead the change as ceo  we believe this will help unlock the companys potential and value gary guidry is a proven value creator  the last four companies in which mr guidry has been the ceo have averaged a  annualized return to shareholders over multiple market cycles and multiple operating jurisdictions  he is a professional engineer and has more than  years of experience developing and maximizing assets in the international oil and gas industry he has direct experience managing large international projects including assets in latin america africa the middleeast and asia most recently mr guidry was the president and ceo of caracal energy a london stock exchange listed company with operations in chad africa  he held that position from mid until the company was acquired by glencore plc for  billion in mid  shareholders received a return of  during this period compared with a ftse  return of  over the same period  prior to caracal mr guidry was the president and ceo of orion oil and gas tsx listed which operated in western canada from mid until mid when it was sold  during his tenure shareholders earned a return of  as compared with the tsx ep index return of   from may  until december  he was the president and ceo of tanganyika oil company tsx listed which operated in syria and egypt under his leadership tanganyika grew production from  bbld to over  bbld and was purchased by sinopec international ltd for  billion with shareholders receiving a return of  as compared to the tsx ep index return of negative  over the same period  prior to tanganyika mr guidry was ceo of calpine natural gas trust  between the ipo of the company in october  and november  when it was sold to viking energy trust he grew p reserves by  with shareholders earning a return of  in  mr guidry was awarded the oil council executive of the year award for his leadership role with caracal energy as a measure of his commitment mr guidry and his team have already made a large capital commitment to gran tierra through the personal acquisition of approximately  million common shares now worth  million west faces board candidates are well qualified to oversee gran tierras development  west face intends to nominate six directors who each possess the capacity for rigorous and independent thinking  they have varied professional backgrounds and will provide the required fresh perspective  the current board in our view is entrenched unaccountable inwardlooking and not aligned with shareholders
