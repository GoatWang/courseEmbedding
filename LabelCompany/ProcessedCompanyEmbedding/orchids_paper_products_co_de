to bring the new paper making machine and new converting line in pryor oklahoma to full capacity in a timely manner  failure to complete in a timely and cost efficient manner the construction planned in barnwell south carolina  intense competition in our markets and aggressive pricing by our competitors could force us to decrease our prices and reduce our profitability if any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect actual results may vary significantly from what we projected any forwardlooking statement you read in the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to the risks listed above and other risks uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations results of operations growth strategy and liquidity we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forwardlooking statements for any reason whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise overview of the business we are a customer focused national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products we produce bulk tissue paper known as parent rolls and convert parent rolls into finished products including paper towels bathroom tissue and paper napkins we sell any parent rolls not required by our converting operation to other converters our integrated manufacturing facilities have flexible production capabilities which allow us to produce high quality tissue products with short production times across all quality tiers for customers in our target regions we predominately sell our products under private labels to our core customer base in the at home market which consists primarily of dollar stores discount retailers and grocery stores that offer limited alternatives across a wide range of products our focus to date has been the dollar stores which are also referred to as discount retailers and the broader discount retail market because of their overall market growth consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units skus the athome tissue market consists of several quality levels including a value tier premium tier and ultrapremium tier to a lesser extent we service customers in the away from home market our core customer base in the away from home market consists of companies in the janitorial market and food service market most of the products we sell in the away from home market are included in the value tier while we expect to continue to service this market in the near term we do not consider the away from home market a growth vehicle for us our strategy is to capitalize on positive market trends by leveraging our industry experience customer relationships and low cost strategic operating footprint to drive growth and profitability for the business our facilities have been designed to have the flexibility to produce and convert parent rolls across different product tiers and to use both virgin and recycled fibers to maximize quality and to control costs we own an integrated facility in pryor oklahoma which has the capacity to supply  tons per year primarily to service the central united states since  we have consistently invested to modernize the paper making and converting equipment at this location and provide the flexibility discussed above furthermore over the past several years we have invested approximately  million at this facility for a new paper machine and a new converting line the new paper machine commenced operations in the second quarter of  and provides us with an additional  tons of parent roll capacity we believe the new paper machine will improve our margins by reducing our manufacturing cost and by providing us additional parent roll capacity our new converting line is expected to commence operations in the second quarter of  and add  tons of converting capacity in june  we expanded our geographic presence to service the united states west coast through a strategic transaction with fabrica de papel san francisco sa de cv fabrica one of the largest tissue manufacturers by capacity in mexico the transaction with fabrica fabrica transaction provided us access to its us customers which we believe will allow us to further penetrate the region and the supply agreement supply agreement we entered into with fabrica has provided access to up to  tons of product each year up to  tons in the first two years of the agreement as part of our strategy to be a national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products we announced plans in april  to begin construction on a worldclass integrated tissue operation in barnwell south carolina we believe that this new facility will allow us to better serve our existing customers in the southeast united states while also enabling us to penetrate new customers in this region the facility is designed to provide highly flexible cost competitive production across all quality tiers with paper making capacity of between  and  tons per year and converting capacity of between  and  tons per year we expect construction on the site will begin in the second quarter of  with the first converting line to be operational by the end of  and the second converting line to be operational by the end of the second quarter of  the paper machine will utilize a highly versatile process capable of producing ultrapremium tier products and is expected to be operational by the beginning of  we estimate the total costs of the project to be approximately  to  million which will be financed through a combination of bank debt and the proceeds from our recent followon stock offering since our inception we have strategically expanded capacity in both paper manufacturing and finished product converting to meet market demand and customers quality requirements the installation of a new paper machine in our oklahoma facility which started up in early march  and installation of a new converting line in our oklahoma facility which is expected to start up in mid is expected to bring our manufacturing capacity in line with our paper production capacity at approximately  tons however any parent rolls in excess of converting production requirements are sold into the market we adjust our paper making production based on our internal converting needs for parent rolls and the open market demand for parent rolls our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products which generally carry higher margins than nonconverted parent rolls the capacity obtained under the previously described fabrica transaction will be sold in converted product form and we do not plan to sell any excess capacity arising from this transaction in parent roll form parent rolls are a commodity product and thus are subject to market pricing we plan to continue to sell any excess parent roll capacity from oklahoma on the open market as long as market pricing is profitable when converting production requirements exceed paper mill capacity we will purchase parent rolls in the open market to meet those converting requirements we supply both national and regional customers with a focus on regions of the united states with high population growth we focus our sales efforts on areas within approximately  miles of either our manufacturing facility in oklahoma or fabricas manufacturing facility in mexicali mexico as we believe this radius maximizes our freight cost advantage because we are one of the few integrated tissue paper manufacturers in the areas around both our oklahoma facility and fabricas mexicali facilities we typically have lower freight costs to our customers distribution centers located in our target regions our target region around our oklahoma facility includes texas oklahoma kansas missouri and arkansas the transaction with fabrica has allowed us to more effectively service customers that are located on the west coast by directly shipping them products that are produced in mexico under the supply agreement as a result we have expanded our target region to include california nevada arizona new mexico and utah our planned manufacturing facility in barnwell south carolina is intended to help us meet the growing demand in the south eastern region of the united states demand for tissue in the athome tissue market has historically been closely correlated to population growth and as such performs well in a variety of economic conditions our expanded target region has experienced strong population growth for the past fourteen years relative to the national average and these trends are expected to continue our products are sold primarily under our customers private labels and to a lesser extent under our brand names such as colortexr my sizer velvetr big mopperr linen softr soft  fluffyr and tackler the fabrica transaction gave us the exclusive right to sell products under fabricas brand names into the united states including under the names virtuer truly greenr golden gate paperr and big qualityr all of our converted product net sales are derived through truck load purchase orders from our customers parent roll net sales are derived from purchase orders that generally cover a onemonth time period we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers which is normal practice within our industry because our products are a daily consumable item the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with limited seasonal fluctuations however we typically experience some mild seasonal softness in the first and fourth quarters of each year primarily due to the effects of winter weather on consumers buying habits and occasional effects of holidays on shipping schedules changes in the national economy in general do not materially affect the market for our converted products due to their nondiscretionary nature and high degree of household penetration our profitability depends on several key factors including but not limited to  the volume of converted product sales  the cost of fiber used in producing paper  the market price of our products the private label market of the tissue industry is highly competitive and many discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive as a result it is difficult to affect price increases we expect these competitive conditions to continue our strategy our strategy is to be a customer focused national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products we believe we will achieve this strategy by  strengthening and expanding our customer base through cooperative and innovative product development and superior customer service  focusing on higher growth geographic regions and private label channels  maintaining flexible low cost integrated facilities able to produce a broad product spectrum  expanding our manufacturing footprint via our transaction with fabrica and our announced expansion in south carolina and  employing a disciplined capital strategy by focusing on growing free cash flow maintaining a low leverage balance sheet and targeting high return capital projects with paybacks of less than five years our strategy is to sell all of our parent roll capacity as converted products such as paper towels bathroom tissue and napkins which generally carry higher margins than nonconverted parent rolls to help achieve that strategy we are placing significant focus on improving our sales efforts to sell all of our converting capacity in addition we continue to focus considerable efforts to improve our converting efficiencies we continue to focus our efforts on growth of our converted product sales and expansion of our product offerings through development of premium tier and ultrapremium tier products the following graph shows shipments of our premium tier and ultrapremium tier products as a percentage of total cases shipped image removed

paper production costs and higher per case converting production costs paper production costs in our oklahoma facility increased primarily due to the demolition of two paper machines in september

making capacity which totaled  million in the quarter paper production costs in oklahoma also increased due to higher fiber prices and  of costs incurred to repair wastewater equipment during the quarter converting production costs in oklahoma increased on a per case basis due to an  decrease in production in the first quarter of  higher labor and maintenance and repairs costs were partially offset by lower outside warehousing expenses and lower employee relocation expenses as a result cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to  in the  quarter from  in the  quarter as noted above paper production costs in our oklahoma facility were negatively affected by the previously discussed shutdown in september of two paper machines which increased production costs per ton

release contains nongaap financial measures a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states in the statement of income balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company the nongaap financial measures used within this press release are  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  operating cash flow less changes in working capital and  changes in working capital ebitda adjusted ebitda operating cash flow less changes in working capital and changes in working capital are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income diluted net income per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity ebitda represents net income before net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is ebitda less stockbased compensation expense changes in working capital is the subtotal of changes in operating assets and liabilities shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows operating cash flow less changes in working capital is net cash provided by operating activities less changes in working capital management believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitate operating performance comparisons between periods and between companies by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and noncash compensation affecting stockbased compensation expense these measures are also commonly used in the industry and are used by our lenders in monitoring adherence to covenants management believes that changes in working capital provides an indication of the cash invested in or provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore may indicate trends in operating performance and may call out a significant source or use of cash during any period operating cash flow less changes in working capital is believed to provide an estimate of the cash generated from all operating activities prior to investments in or liquidations of operating assets and liabilities and therefore may indicate trends in operating performance and may call out significant changes in the generation of cash through operating activities forwardlooking statementsthis
