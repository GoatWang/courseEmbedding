grant him leave to bring proceedings in the name of nz products international limited nzpil against zhixiong chen mr chen snr and youngzhou chen mr chen jnr background  nzpil was incorporated on  june  mr he and mr chen jnr are its de jure directors mr he and his wife hold  per cent of the shares in nzpil the balance  per cent of the shares are held by the chen interests through a trustee company and mr chen jnr and his wife  prior to the incorporation of nzpil mr he carried on a business which involved the purchase of new zealand made dairy and health supplements in retail stores in new zealand and the export of them for sale into hong kong and china through mr hes contacts in those markets  mr he and mr chen snr were known to each other mr he says that mr chen snr suggested that they establish a commercial joint venture cjv to exploit the opportunity identified by mr he mr chen snr proposed that he provide finance to increase the scale of the operation mr he says that mr chen snr suggested that his son mr chen jnr be a director and the chen interests would hold  per cent of the shares in the joint venture company mr he agreed nzpil was incorporated to give effect to that agreement  mr he says that mr chen snr then advanced sums totalling  to him for the purposes of the cjv mr chen snr does not agree he says that the  advanced to mr he was a personal loan which mr he is liable for  mr he says mr chen snr also convinced him to take a minority shareholding in another company hong kong dairy international limited hkdil on the basis that company would be used to expand the business to include sales of new zealand seafood and wine through mr chens snrs contacts in hong kong hkdil was incorporated in hong kong mr he says that from february  onwards mr chen snr required all nzpils exports to be sold to hkdil for distribution  mr he alleges that mr chen snr has breached the terms of the cjv in a number of ways of particular relevance for present purposes is mr hes allegation that while he was in hong kong between  december  and  february  he discovered that mr chen snr had been operating a business in competition to nzpil mr he says that unknown to him mr chen snr had been operating the same business as nzpil and hkdil and storing the product at two of hkdils three warehouses in hong kong  further when mr he accessed nzpils bank accounts on  february  the accounts disclosed that the chens had transferred almost all of nzpils receipts to themselves including a gst refund of in excess of  on  january  mr he says on learning that he transferred  out of an account of nzpils to his own personal account  mr he also says that mr chen snr incorporated a further hong kong company new zealand milk powder limited nzmpl at about this time in january  he also refers to a further company incorporated by mr chen snr in new zealand dairy new zealand international ltd although no specific allegations are made concerning that entity  unsurprisingly the relationship between the parties has broken down entirely mr chen snr issued proceedings on  september  against mr he for the recovery of the  mr he threatened to take proceedings against mr chen snr in october  but ultimately brought the application for leave to bring a derivative action in the name of nzpil against both mr chen snr and mr chen jnr  nzpil is no longer trading mr chen jnr has applied for it to be placed in liquidation mr he opposes its liquidation associate judge doogues judgment  associate judge doogue recited the background to the proposed derivative claim from the draft pleading as supplemented by reference to the affidavits filed he then considered the principles that apply to an application for leave under s  of the companies act  the act and the high court decisions of needham v ebt worldwide ltd and vrij v boyle and adopted the following proposition from those cases the appropriate test is that which would be exercised by a prudent business person in the conduct of his or her own affairs when deciding whether to bring a claim such a decision requires one to consider such matters as the amount at stake the apparent strength of the claim likely costs and the prospect of executing any judgment  associate judge doogue estimated that nzpils chances of success in an action against mr chen snr for breach of fiduciary obligation are not great  he concluded that the application for leave ought to be declined on the grounds that a prudent company director would not embark upon the proposed litigation assuming it was proved mr chen snr had set up a parallel company structure to carry on a similar business to that which nzpil was involved in he was doubtful whether that amounted to a breach of obligations owed as a director to nzpil in the judges view it was not clear that any information mr chen snr had taken advantage of contained any confidential character  further nzpil was no longer trading having regard to the situation that existed between the directors associate judge doogue considered nzpil would be a suitable candidate for liquidation he was firmly of the view that appointment of a liquidator would represent the best approach to resolving the issues between the parties so far as nzpil was concerned including whether nzpil ought to pursue mr chen snr for the alleged breaches of his duties as a director the appeal  mr he appeals principally on the ground that the associate judge was wrong to conclude nzpil did not have a good claim against mr chen snr for breach of the fiduciary duty he owed the company as a de facto director mr he argues that mr chen snr breached the fiduciary duty he owed nzpil by diverting corporate opportunities from nzpil to himself or to entities associated with him  in addition to supporting the associate judges reasoning the respondents seek to support the judgment under appeal on the following additional grounds a mr chen snr was not a director of nzpil b the relief sought in the proposed derivative action is either i relief that the appellant seeks personally ii based on the cjv between the appellant and mr chen snr to which the company was not a party or iii relief that has no legal basis or which this court has no jurisdiction to grant and c the claims in the proposed derivative action would be more appropriately dealt with by a liquidator of the company and d it would not be appropriate for the appellant to control the derivative action on behalf of the company  the point identified at a raises a preliminary issue the points at b are relevant to the issue of the strength of the proposed claim while the issues at c and d are relevant to the exercise of the courts discretion under s  decision threshold requirement  the respondents raise a preliminary issue as to whether mr chen snr was a director of nzpil however there is another preliminary point section  of the act provides that leave may only be granted if the court is satisfied that a the company or related company does not intend to bring diligently continue or defend or discontinue the proceedings as the case may be or b it is in the interests of the company or related company that the conduct of the proceedings should not be left to the directors or to the determination of the shareholders as a whole  although the associate judge referred to s  he did not expressly discuss it that subsection provides a threshold requirement which must be met before the courts discretion to give leave to bring a derivative action may be exercised section b aids the assessment by requiring a company to inform the court whether it intends to bring proceedings even without this information as in the present case a court might nonetheless be satisfied the company does not intend to bring proceedings the court may be so satisfied by drawing inferences from the evidence available to it we consider the direction that the court be œsatisfied without more permits the threshold to be met in this way if the evidence justifies it  such an exercise will be appropriate especially where the company is unable as a matter of practical reality to make the decision whether to bring proceedings situations in which this has proved to be the case include  where the companys board is deadlocked  where the proposed defendants of the derivative action control the board and  where the company has ceased trading in these situations it would be unrealistic to suggest the absence of positive affirmation by the company as to whether it intends to bring proceedings means the threshold requirement cannot be met other evidence may well satisfy the court it is met  in this case we are satisfied nzpil does not intend to bring proceedings the management of nzpil is effectively deadlocked the he and chen interests are equal shareholders nzpils directors mr he and mr chen jnr cannot agree on the future of nzpil mr chen jnr is seeking a liquidation of the company mr he opposes that from this evidence we infer nzpil does not intend to bring proceedings we are satisfied that the threshold requirement in s a is met is mr chen snr a director of nzpil  the next preliminary issue is whether mr chen snr is a director of nzpil the proposed claim is based on the allegation that mr chen snr was a director of nzpil and owed fiduciary duties to the company mr campbell qc submitted there was insufficient evidence that mr chen snr was a director  mr chen snr will be a director of nzpil for the purposes of the act if mr chen jnr could be required or was accustomed to act in accordance with mr chen snrs directions or if the board of the company mr he and mr chen jnr were required or accustomed to act in accordance with mr chen snrs instructions  mr campbell submitted that the only suggestion mr chen jnr was subject to mr chen snrs direction was a reference in mr hes evidence to an incident when mr he asked mr chen snr to speak to mr chen jnr about withdrawing funds from nzpil to gamble at sky city he submitted that was insufficient and no more than a father being asked to bring his son into line  however we agree with mr judd qcs submission that taken overall the evidence discloses that mr chen jnr was effectively acting at his fathers behest and direction when acting as a director of nzpil  the background to the relationship between the three men and the incorporation of nzpil is relevant the proposal for the incorporation of nzpil came from mr chen snr mr chen snr offered to fund the expansion of mr hes business on the basis that nzpil would be incorporated and the chen interests would share in its profits mr chen snr led the discussions with mr he as a quid pro quo he required his son mr chen jnr be appointed as a director of the company those factors support the inference that mr chen jnr was effectively mr chen snrs nominee and would do his bidding  further nzpil was dependent on the funding provided by mr chen snr on mr hes evidence mr chen snr only allocated further tranches of funding once he was satisfied that previous payments and shipments had been applied in accordance with his requirements we consider that mr chens control went further than that of a financier as mr campbell suggested through his active control of the funding mr chen snr controlled the direction of the company next it is relevant that when mr he noticed that mr chen jnr had withdrawn in excess of  from the company and spent it at sky city he raised the matter with mr chen snr not mr chen jnr the withdrawals from the company stopped again the inference is that mr chen jnr was subject to the direction and control of mr chen snr for all of those reasons we are satisfied that mr chen snr was a director of nzpil under s b of the act the mandatory considerations  we turn to consider the main issue namely whether leave should have been granted for the proposed derivative action as the appellant argues section  provides that in exercising its discretion the court is required to have regard to a the likelihood of the proceedings succeeding b the costs of the proceedings in relation to the relief likely to be obtained c any action already taken by the company or related company to obtain relief d the interests of the company or related company in the proceedings being commenced    this section requires the court to assess each consideration separately the relative weight each carries will depend on the facts of the case in assessing each statutory criterion the court should adopt the standard œwhich would be exercised by a prudent business person in the conduct of his or her own affairs when deciding whether to bring a claim it is very well established by high court authority which we endorse that the prudent business person standard applies to an assessment of s a it has also consistently informed the courts assessment of the remaining three criteria while we emphasise it is the express words of each statutory consideration which the court must have regard to we consider it helpful to assess whether each criterion applies to the prudent business person standard  turning to the present case clearly nzpil has not taken and does not propose to take any action the principal considerations in this case are the likelihood of the proceedings succeeding and the costs of the proceedings in relation to the likely relief it can be accepted that in principle if the company has an otherwise justified claim it will be in the interests of the company to pursue it although that does not necessarily address whether the claim ought to be pursued by a liquidator as opposed to mr he an issue that we return to  mr judd submitted associate judge doogue was wrong to conclude that the proposed proceedings were not likely to succeed  the draft statement of claim attached to mr hes application for leave contains two causes of action a the first a personal claim by mr he against the messrs chen for breach of the fiduciary duty owed by them as joint venturers under the cjv b the second the proposed claim by nzpil against the messrs chen for recovery of funds misappropriated by them and for breach of fiduciary duties  the focus in the high court and in mr judds submissions on appeal was on the breach of the fiduciary duty mr chen snr owed nzpil the reason associate judge doogue did not consider nzpil to be likely to succeed in that claim is found in the following passage of his judgment  the fact that the opportunity in this case cannot reasonably be viewed as closely held information conferring a competitive disadvantage on the company would be a contraindication against the court finding that a fiduciary obligation had been breached when the director took steps to set up a business in the same area of activity  it is not clear either that the company can realistically claim that knowledge of the market opportunity to buy the products in question from supermarket shelves in new zealand and sell them at a profit in china was a special advantage that the company possessed  the associate judge referred to the discussion regarding a directors use of confidential information in holden v architectural finishes ltd and did not consider the information mr chen snr gained was sufficiently confidential however mr judd submitted the focus of the proposed claim was more on the doctrine of corporate opportunity the law is summarised in the text by professor watts directors must not pursue for themselves business opportunities that would connect with the companys business unless the company consents this duty called the œcorporate opportunity duty operates whether or not the director has used his or her position or confidential information to pursue the opportunity it is hence a discrete head of claim  vrij v boyle is itself an example of the application of the corporate opportunity doctrine the applicant alleged mr boyle had taken advantage of his position as a director of the company and the associated knowledge he had gained of the customers of the company and opportunities for future business in order to establish a competing company he had thereby gained personal benefit for himself and his family fisher j accepted the company had an arguable claim against mr boyle  the proposed claim in this case arises out of the alleged breach of the duties owed by mr chen snr under s  of the act to act in good faith and in the best interests of nzpil importantly the evidence suggests that in purchasing retail products in new zealand mr he also had existing connections for distribution of the products in hong kong and in china through nzpil mr chen snr became aware of those contacts and distribution networks  we agree that it is not for the court on an application for leave under s  to make a determination on the ultimate merits of the claim but we are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to support an arguable claim against mr chen snr for breach of the fiduciary duty he owed nzpil mr chen snr established companies which then on mr hes evidence competed with nzpil in establishing the companies and directing their business it is arguable mr chen snr used some of the connections he had made or was aware of through his involvement with nzpil the business the companies generated and the opportunities taken were arguably at the expense of nzpil  further even if the opportunities which mr chen snr availed himself of were publicly available he was not permitted to avail himself of them because as we have found he was a director of a company which was itself exploiting similar opportunities peters v birnie  in reaching the conclusion nzpil has an arguable case against mr chen snr for breach of s  of the act we do not overlook mr campbells submission that nzpil ceased trading in february  that however is more relevant to the consideration of the value of the claim rather than whether nzpil has a claim at all  it follows that we conclude the judge was wrong to dismiss the proposed claim against mr chen snr on the basis mr chen snrs actions may not have amounted to a breach of the obligations he owed nzpil as a director the form of the proposed claim  however our conclusion that the prospects of nzpil succeeding in a claim against mr chen snr for breach of fiduciary duty were better than the associate judge considered them to be is not an end of the matter there are the other issues raised by mr campbell and the further mandatory considerations in s   mr campbell also argued that the nature of the relief sought in the proposed derivative action did not support leave being granted because the relief was either more appropriately pursued by mr he personally or the relief had no legal basis  we agree that the relief sought in the proposed draft claim is confused as relevant the prayer for relief in the second cause of action seeks  c an order by way of declaration that hkdil the hk company incorporated to directly distribute nzpil export sales in hk and china hkdil be treated as its wholly owned subsidiary d an order by way of declaration that chen snr and chen jnr in their execution of the same business as nzpil and hkdil as they have structured through their nz company dairy new zealand international limited and the hk company controlled by them new zealand milk powder limited account for the export sales business and profits as made in the same manner as if all such business had been done through nzpil and hkdil in accordance with the terms and conditions of its shareholders cjv e an order for the preparation and an audit of its accounts in line and in accordance with the orders  above f an order that chen snr and chen jnr are to repay to it all funds that they have withdrawn from its bank accounts to which they are not legally entitled to g an order that chen snr and chen jnr are to reimburse it the usd of the scampi products purchased from sanford as shipped to guangzhou yingbin trading co of china and to account for its share of the profits from the on sale of the said products in china h damages for losses suffered by it to be quantified before trial   as to the declaration sought regarding hkdil a new zealand court does not have jurisdiction over hkdil as it is registered in hong kong further and more practically in terms of the prospect of any recovery hkdil has been wound up  next to the extent the relief sought in d is apparently based on the cjv nzpil was not a party to the cjv it is not at all clear how it is said nzpil could enforce any rights which appear to be personal to mr he  the application for an order for the preparation of and audit of nzpils accounts relates back to the relief claimed in c and d and would not be available in any derivative action on behalf of nzpil  while the claim at f that mr chen snr and mr chen jnr repay all funds wrongly withdrawn from nzpils bank accounts is a claim nzpil could properly maintain it plainly requires an accounting exercise it is an exercise that a liquidator could appropriately carry out as mr cogswell noted there is approximately  frozen in the companys accounts at present which should enable a liquidator to at least commence a review of the companys accounts  further the pleadings are again not at all helpful on this aspect of the claim while at  of the proposed claim it is alleged  is owing to nzpil by the chens that global figure is not explained or supported elsewhere in the pleading at least not in relation to the proposed cause of action by nzpil although reference is made to the withdrawal of  that is in the first cause of action which relates to mr hes personal claim the general and unspecified claims by mr he can be contrasted with the evidence of the accounts prepared by nzpils accountants although we acknowledge mr hes allegation the accountants were acting at mr chen snrs direction  the basis for the relief sought in g relating to the scampi shipment is found in  to  of the proposed claim it is alleged that at mr chen snrs direction nzpil ordered and paid for scampi products financed by hkdil and shipped them to guangzhou yingbin trading co a company related to mr chen guangzhou yingbin trading co argued that the shipment was damaged mr he alleges that despite this guangzhou yingbin trading co uplifted the scampi and disposed of it but has failed to pay nzpil for it how that could support a claim by nzpil against mr chen snr is not at all clear nzpil could well have a claim against guangzhou yingbin trading co but that does not equate to a claim against mr chen snr  against that background while we accept that the judge may have erred in too readily finding nzpil may not have a claim against mr chen snr for breach of fiduciary duty the present relief claimed does not support such a claim the pleadings would have to be substantially redrawn to support any claim by nzpil as presently constituted the present claim is more directly concerned with mr hes response to the personal claim against him by mr chen for  that is reflected by the draft derivative claim naming nzpil as a second plaintiff to a counterclaim with mr he being the first plaintiff to that counterclaim mr chen jnrs position  before returning to the remaining considerations under s  we address the position of mr chen jnr mr chen jnrs position was not dealt with in any detail in the high court or by the appellant before us on appeal mr cogswell submitted as a preliminary point that the dispute between mr he and mr chen jnr should go to arbitration in accordance with cl  of nzpils constitution however that clause is directed at a deadlock in management it would not prevent the company suing a director for breach of duty  the more difficult issue for mr he with the proposed claim against mr chen jnr is that the basis of the claim is not at all clear while mr chen jnr is referred to in the prayer for relief and relief is sought against him the basis for the claims is not at all apparent from the preceding paragraphs of the draft claim the direct allegations against mr chen jnr seem to be limited to his removal of about  worth of red wine purchased by nzpil the costbenefit analysis  we return to the mandatory considerations under s  and particularly the costs of the proposed proceeding in relation to the likely relief  generally the costs of the proposed proceedings are to be met by the company unless the court considers it unjust or inequitable for the company to bear the costs however mr judd submitted that in this case the cost of the proceedings was irrelevant as mr he would fund the proceedings personally at least until judgment was obtained when he would expect to be reimbursed  despite that we consider it is still necessary to make an assessment of the costs as against the likely benefit to address the issue of whether a prudent business person would actually pursue the proposed claims a party in mr hes position cannot avoid the court directing itself to s b as it is required to do by offering to underwrite the claim the court would not for example allow a director to use the company to pursue a weak claim against other directors even if the director offered to underwrite the claim  it is difficult to carry out a costbenefit analysis in the present case the proposed claim for the breach of corporate opportunity is not quantified it may be very difficult to quantify the ambit may be limited as mr campbell noted nzpil has not traded since february  further no precise attempt has been made to estimate the costs of the proceedings but even the costs of a standard fixture of three days would be in the region of  to  at a minimum this case is unlikely to be resolved so readily  nzpil may have an arguable but confined claim against mr chen snr for breach of fiduciary duty but when consideration is had to the current confused state of the pleading and the costs of the proceedings we are not at all satisfied that a reasonably prudent business person acting in pursuit of his or her own interests would decide to pursue the proposed claim on the information currently before the court general discretion  finally we note the four criteria in s  expressly apply œwithout limiting subsection  which in turn provides the court œmay  grant leave to bring the derivative action for this reason even if mr he was able to satisfy the court that nzpil has an arguable claim against mr chen snr the court retains a discretion whether to grant leave to mr he to pursue the claim in the context of this appeal it is unnecessary for us to discuss the nature and extent of that discretion except to confirm its broad terms  a major factor in this case is that the company is no longer trading as noted it is also subject to an application for liquidation one of the principal areas of concern is that the chens have taken money from nzpil where the dispute is effectively over the taking of accounts of a company which is no longer trading a derivative action may well not be appropriate  we consider that given the complete falling out between the parties and the current impasse in the company the appropriate way for the claims that have been identified to be advanced is through the liquidation process the liquidator can carry out the accounting exercise to determine what amounts if any the parties may owe the company for moneys wrongfully withdrawn from it  further while in an appropriate case leave might be granted to pursue a derivative action based on a breach of fiduciary duty even where the company is facing liquidation we consider the fact the company is no longer trading is a particularly relevant factor in this case if after taking independent advice the liquidator determines there is a reasonably arguable claim against mr chen snr or jnr for breach of duty as directors then the liquidator could bring such a claim  standing back and looking at the matter overall we do not consider the court should exercise its discretion and grant leave to mr he to pursue a derivative action in this case we consider the liquidation application should be allowed to proceed we would not want any grant of leave to be used as a means to avoid the liquidation of the company which on the information currently before the court otherwise appears appropriate result  for those reasons which are somewhat different to those of the associate judge we have come to the same conclusion the appeal is dismissed costs  costs should follow the outcome of the appeal in the usual way  the appellant is to pay the first and second respondents costs for a standard appeal on a band a basis and usual disbursements   chen v he
