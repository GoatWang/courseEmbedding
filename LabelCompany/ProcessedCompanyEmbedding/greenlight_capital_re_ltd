collectively to glre and its consolidated subsidiaries the class a ordinary shares of glre are listed on nasdaq global select market under the symbol “glre” these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” and in accordance with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete consolidated financial statements these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december    in the opinion of management these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all of the normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods presented the results for the three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full calendar year reclassifications during the year ended december   the company revised its classification of the lines of business presented in note  of the condensed consolidated financial statements as a result the gross written premiums relating to certain lines of business previously reported for the three months ended march    have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation the reclassification resulted in no changes to net income loss or retained earnings for any of the periods presented     significant accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the period actual results could differ from these estimates   return to table of contents   restricted cash and cash equivalents   the company is required to maintain certain cash in segregated accounts with prime brokers and derivative counterparties the amount of restricted cash held by prime brokers is primarily used to support the liability created from securities sold not yet purchased and derivatives additionally restricted cash and cash equivalent balances are held to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to cedents see notes  and   the amount of cash encumbered varies depending on the market value of the securities sold not yet purchased and the collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust accounts and letters of credit in addition derivative counterparties require cash collateral to support the current value of any amounts that may be due to the counterparty based on the value of the underlying financial instrument premium revenue recognition  the company accounts for reinsurance contracts in accordance with us gaap in the event that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk deposit accounting is used and the contract is reported as a deposit liability  the company writes excess of loss contracts as well as quota share contracts the company estimates the ultimate premiums for the entire contract period these estimates are based on information received from the ceding companies and estimates from actuarial pricing models used by the company for excess of loss contracts the total ultimate estimated premiums are recorded as premiums written at the inception of the contract for quota share contracts the premiums are recorded as written based on cession statements from cedents which typically are received monthly or quarterly depending on the terms specified in each contract for any reporting lag premiums written are estimated based on the portion of the ultimate estimated premiums relating to the risks underwritten during the lag period  premium estimates are reviewed by management at least quarterly such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates based on management’s review the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined changes in premium estimates including premium receivable on both excess of loss and quota share contracts are expected and may result in significant adjustments in any period a significant portion of amounts included in reinsurance balances receivable represent estimated premiums written net of commissions and brokerage and are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts certain contracts allow for reinstatement premiums in the event of a full limit loss prior to the expiry of a contract a reinstatement premium is not due until there is a full limit loss event and therefore in accordance with us gaap the company records a reinstatement premium as written only in the event that a client incurs a full limit loss on the contract and the contract allows for a reinstatement of coverage upon payment of an additional premium for catastrophe contracts which contractually require the payment of a reinstatement premium equal to or greater than the original premium upon the occurrence of a full limit loss the reinstatement premiums are earned over the original contract period reinstatement premiums that are contractually calculated on a prorata basis of the original premiums are earned over the remaining coverage period for additional premiums which are due on a contract that has no remaining coverage period the additional premiums are earned in full when due certain contracts may provide for a penalty to be paid if the contract is terminated and canceled prior to its expiration term cancellation penalties are recognized in the period the notice of cancellation is received and are recorded in the consolidated statements of income under “other income expense net” premiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion to the period of risk covered unearned premiums consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided deferred acquisition costs   policy acquisition costs such as commission and brokerage costs relate directly to and vary with the writing of reinsurance contracts acquisition costs relating solely to bound contracts are deferred subject to ultimate recoverability and are amortized over the related contract term the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs by determining if the sum of future earned premiums and anticipated investment income is greater than the expected future claims and expenses if a loss is probable on the unexpired portion of policies in force a premium deficiency loss is recognized at march   and december    the deferred acquisition costs were considered fully recoverable and no premium deficiency loss was recorded   return to table of contents acquisition costs also include profit commissions which are expensed when incurred profit commissions are calculated and accrued based on the expected loss experience for contracts and recorded when the current loss estimate indicates that a profit commission is probable under the contract terms as of march     million  december     million  of profit commission reserves were included in reinsurance balances payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets  for the three months ended march     million     million  of net profit commission expense was included in acquisition costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income    loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and recoverable   the company establishes reserves for contracts based on estimates of the ultimate cost of all losses including losses incurred but not reported “ibnr” these estimated ultimate reserves are based on the company’s own actuarial estimates derived from reports received from ceding companies industry data and historical experience these estimates are reviewed by the company periodically on a contract by contract basis and adjusted as necessary since reserves are estimates the final settlement of losses may vary from the reserves established and any adjustments to the estimates which may be material are recorded in the period they are determined   loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable include the amounts due from retrocessionaires for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses on retrocession agreements ceded losses incurred but not reported are estimated based on the company’s actuarial estimates these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted when deemed necessary the company may not be able to ultimately recover the loss and loss adjustment expense recoverable amounts due to the retrocessionaires’ inability to pay the company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and records provisions for uncollectible reinsurance expenses recoverable when recovery is no longer probable consideration paid by the company for retroactive reinsurance that meets the conditions for reinsurance accounting eg loss portfolio transfers are reported as loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable to the extent those amounts do not exceed the associated liabilities if the amounts paid for retroactive reinsurance exceed the liabilities the company increases the related liabilities at the time the reinsurance contract is effective and the excess is charged to net income as losses incurred if the liabilities exceed the amounts paid the recoverable balance is increased to reflect the difference and the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the estimated loss payout period changes in the estimated amount of liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured contracts are recognized in net income in the period of the change   notes receivable   notes receivable include promissory notes receivable from third party entities these notes are recorded at cost along with accrued interest if any which approximates the fair value interest income and realized gains or losses on sale of notes receivable are included under net investment income loss in the condensed consolidated statements of income the company regularly reviews all notes receivable individually for impairment and records valuation allowance provisions for uncollectible and nonperforming notes the company places notes on nonaccrual status when the recorded value of the note is not considered impaired but there is uncertainty as to the collection of interest in accordance with the terms of the note for notes receivable placed on nonaccrual status the notes are recorded excluding any accrued interest amount the company resumes accrual of interest on a note when none of the principal or interest remains past due and the company expects to collect the remaining contractual principal and interest interest collected on notes that are placed on nonaccrual status is treated on a cashbasis and recorded as interest income when collected provided that the recorded value of the note is deemed to be fully collectible where doubt exists as to the collectability of the remaining recorded value of the notes placed on nonaccrual status any payments received are applied to reduce the recorded value of the notes at march     million of notes receivable net of any valuation allowance were on nonaccrual status  december     million  and any payments received were applied to reduce the recorded value of the notes   at march   and december    there was no accrued interest included in the notes receivable balance based on management’s assessment the recorded values of the notes receivable net of valuation allowance at march   and december    were expected to be fully collectible  return to table of contents financial instruments   investments in securities and investments in securities sold not yet purchased   the company’s investments in debt instruments and equity securities that are classified as “trading securities” are carried at fair value the fair values of the listed equity investments are derived based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical

partnerships and private and unlisted equity securities where observable inputs are not available the fair values are derived based on unobservable inputs level  inputs such as management’s assumptions developed from available information using the services of the investment advisor including the most recent net asset values obtained from the managers of those underlying investments for certain private equity fund investments the company has elected to measure the fair value using the net asset value practical expedient allowed under us gaap and accordingly these investments are not classified as level   or  in the fair value hierarchy for securities classified as “trading securities” and “other investments” any realized and unrealized gains or losses are determined on the basis of the specific identification method by reference to cost or amortized cost as appropriate and included in net investment income loss in the condensed consolidated statements of income dividend

refer to part i item a contained in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december    we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements which speak only to the dates on which they were made   we intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio in a timely manner through a public announcement other than as required by the exchange act we do not intend to make public announcements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe based on management’s estimates and current information will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position general   we are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the cayman islands with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors our goal is to build longterm shareholder value by selectively offering customized reinsurance solutions in markets where capacity and alternatives are limited which we believe will yield favorable longterm returns on equity   we aim to complement our underwriting results with a nontraditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that employ more traditional fixedincome investment strategies we manage our investment portfolio according to a valueoriented philosophy in which we take long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities   because we employ an opportunistic underwriting philosophy periodtoperiod comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful in addition our historical investment results may not necessarily be indicative of future performance due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period segments   we manage our business on the basis of one operating segment property and casualty reinsurance in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative criteria established by us gaap within the property and casualty reinsurance segment we analyze our underwriting operations using two categories  return to table of contents   ● frequency business and    ● severity business frequency business is generally characterized as contracts containing a potentially large number of small losses emanating from multiple events clients generally buy this protection to increase their own underwriting capacity and typically select a reinsurer based upon the reinsurer’s financial strength service and expertise we expect the results of frequency business to be less volatile than those of severity business from period to period due to greater predictability we also expect that over time the profit margins and return on equity of our frequency business will be lower than those of our severity business   severity business is generally characterized as contracts with the potential for significant losses emanating from one event or multiple events clients generally buy this protection to remove volatility from their balance sheets and accordingly we expect the results of severity business to be volatile from period to period however over the long term we also expect that our severity business will generate higher profit margins and return on equity than those of our frequency business outlook and trends the reinsurance industry has experienced significant consolidation in the last several years fueled by many traditional participants with excess capital looking to strengthen their positions in their respective core markets we believe further consolidation will likely continue but do not believe that consolidation will result in a significant reduction in total capital within the industry rather we expect the industry consolidation to create concentrations of capital in fewer larger participants and that with a reduction in the number of competitors in the industry pricing may partially stabilize further while some opportunities may become available on an attractive basis to only the largest reinsurance companies in the industry we believe that the consolidation trend may create new opportunities for us if less capacity is available in the market as a result of industry consolidation we do not believe that the overcapitalization of the market is uniform across all industry participants and there are many insurers and reinsurers with lower financial security profiles than ours that we believe have and will continue to suffer disproportionately we believe the value proposition of our reinsurance capabilities and our differentiated underwriting strategy positions us well to compete for new targeted business in niche areas that we know and can service well a key part of our underwriting strategy is to identify and partner with companies that have suffered dislocation accordingly given declining or flat investment earnings for fixed income investors resulting from a prolonged low interest rate environment we believe underwriting opportunities may increase which we intend to pursue where we believe pricing is economically rational conversely if attractive opportunities are not available on economically rational terms we anticipate that we will seek to maintain or even reduce premium writings rather than accept mispriced risk in order to conserve our capital for a more opportune environment we believe that significant price increases could occur if financial and credit markets experience adverse shocks that result in the loss of capital of insurers and reinsurers or if there are major catastrophic events especially in north america we have recently observed stability and favorable trends in our underlying rates for our nonstandard automobile business which we believe adequately compensates insurers for increased claims frequency trends in private passenger auto we expect to have a high concentration of premium in this line for the foreseeable future we have observed an increase in the demand for us health stop loss insurance as more employers seek to control health care costs by pursuing alternatives to first dollar health care plans subject to the affordable care act we believe that the majority of the demand has been underwritten by large carriers that elect to not purchase reinsurance although we also believe that a portion has been underwritten by managing general underwriters who often rely heavily on quota share reinsurance we will to seek to increase our market share from managing general underwriters that operate in this line we will continue to monitor any proposed changes to the affordable care act under the new us administration and react to potential impacts to this line of business private us mortgage insurers appear to be increasingly seeking quota share reinsurance options as a result of the implementation of the private mortgage insurers eligibility requirements pmiers in the united states which effectively increases the cost of capital for the private mortgage insurers we believe the credit underwriting standards for us mortgages are good and as a result the riskadjusted profitability of these portfolios is satisfactory we expect that reinsurance of us mortgage risk will become a growing part of our underwriting portfolio during   return to table of contents our casualty business is generally comprised of larger syndicated reinsurance placements for general casualty professional liability and workers’ compensation for most of this business we are not the lead underwriter and instead we generally follow the market on these transactions this business has a longer duration of claim payments than other types of business that we have historically written which leads to a buildup of reserves and exposure over a longer period of time while our casualty business has grown in recent years we expect this portion of our business to remain at  levels during  unless we find additional attractive opportunities we note that pricing for property catastrophe retro and other property catastrophe business has been and continues to be under severe competitive pressure and we believe much of the business in the market is being priced below expected losses as such we have decreased our focus on property catastrophe retro over the past several years until there is a market changing event that improves expected profitability underlying rates for florida homeowners’ insurance continue to decline and water damage claims and fraudulent assignment of benefit “aob” claims continue to increase expected losses the florida legislature did not address the aob problem during legislative sessions in  our expectation is that aob claims will continue during  which will result in less attractive profit margins on this business despite this we believe that the reinsurance terms and conditions continue to be highly competitive we have significantly reduced our exposure to florida homeowners’ insurance and are monitoring changes to the legal and political environment with regards to the aob issue   while competitive market conditions have made it challenging to find and successfully underwrite new business that meets our targeted return hurdles we believe that we have a strong pipeline of attractive opportunities with counterparties that seek highly customized structures terms and conditions which aligns well with our underwriting strategy during the january   renewal period our renewals were at historically comparable levels and we continue to see new opportunities we will continue to monitor market conditions and pursue opportunities to best position ourselves to participate in future underserved or capacityconstrained markets as they arise and intend to offer products that we believe will generate favorable returns on equity over the long term accordingly our underlying results and product line concentrations in any given period may vary perhaps significantly and are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations our investment portfolio had a net long exposure of  as of march    our goal for  is to protect capital in an uncertain environment and to find investment opportunities on both our long and short portfolios that we believe will generate positive returns despite the recent federal reserve interest rate increases monetary policy remains very accommodative globally  additionally there are many global economic investment and political uncertainties and risks that may impact our business given the uncertainties we deem it appropriate to maintain comparatively lower net equity exposures and to hold a significant position in gold and other macro positions critical accounting policies   our condensed consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values if certain factors including those described in “part i item ia — risk factors” included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december    cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or estimates there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity we believe that the critical accounting policies set forth in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements these accounting policies pertain to premium revenues and risk transfer valuation of investments loss and loss adjustment expense reserves acquisition costs bonus accruals and sharebased payments   recently issued accounting standards and their impact to the company if any are presented under “recent accounting pronouncements” in note  of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements  key financial measures and nongaap measures in addition to the consolidated financial statements management uses certain key financial measures some of which are not prescribed under us gaap rules and standards “nongaap financial measures” to evaluate our financial performance and the overall growth in shareholder value generally a nongaap financial measure as defined in sec regulation g is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap management believes that these measures which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies provide a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand  return to table of contents performance trends and allow for a more complete understanding of the company’s business nongaap financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with us gaap the key nongaap financial measures used in this report are • basic adjusted book value per share • fully diluted adjusted book value per share • net underwriting income loss basic adjusted book value per share and fully diluted adjusted book value per share we believe that longterm growth in fully diluted adjusted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick by which to monitor the shareholder value generated in addition fully diluted adjusted book value per share may be useful to our investors shareholders and other interested parties to form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry basic adjusted book value per share is considered a nongaap financial measure because it excludes from the total equity the noncontrolling interest in a joint venture fully diluted adjusted book value per share is also considered a nongaap financial measure and represents basic adjusted book value per share combined with the impact from dilution of all inthemoney stock options and rsus issued and outstanding as of any period end we adjust the total equity by excluding the noncontrolling interest in a joint venture because it does not reflect the equity attributable to our shareholders basic adjusted book value per share and fully diluted adjusted book value per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable us gaap measures the following table presents a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures basic adjusted and fully diluted adjusted book value per share to the most comparable us

return to table of contents net underwriting income loss one way that management evaluates the company’s underwriting performance is through the measurement of net underwriting income loss we do not use premiums written as a measure of performance net underwriting income loss is a performance measure used by management as it measures the underlying fundamentals of the company’s underwriting operations management believes that the use of net underwriting income loss enables investors and other users of the company’s financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance management also believes that this measure follows industry practice and therefore allows the users of financial information to compare the company’s performance with its industry peer group net underwriting income loss is considered a nongaap financial measure because it excludes items used in the calculation of net income before taxes under us gaap the measure includes underwriting expenses which are directly related to underwriting activities as well as an allocation of other general and administrative expenses net underwriting income loss is calculated as net premiums earned less net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred less acquisition costs and less underwriting expenses the measure excludes on a recurring basis  net investment income  any foreign exchange gains or losses  corporate general and administrative expenses  other income expense not related to underwriting and  income taxes and income attributable to noncontrolling interest we exclude net investment income and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions we exclude corporate general and administrative expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations we believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations net underwriting income loss should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income the reconciliations of net underwriting income loss to income loss before income taxes the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure on a consolidated

and customized nature of our underwriting operations we expect to report different loss and expense ratios in both our frequency and severity businesses from period to period the following table provides the ratios    three months ended march    three months ended march                          frequency   severity   total   frequency   severity   total                         loss ratio                       acquisition cost ratio                 composite ratio                       underwriting expense ratio                     combined ratio                                          the loss ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned we expect that the loss ratio will be volatile for our severity business and may exceed that of our frequency business in certain periods given that we opportunistically underwrite a concentrated portfolio across several lines of business that have varying expected loss ratios we can expect there to be significant annual variations in the loss ratios reported from our frequency business in addition the loss ratios for both frequency and severity business can vary depending on the mix of the lines of business written  the acquisition cost ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs by net premiums earned we expect that this ratio will generally be higher for our frequency business than for our severity business   the composite ratio is the ratio of underwriting losses incurred loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs excluding underwriting related general and administrative expenses to net premiums earned similar to the loss ratio we expect that this ratio will be more volatile for our severity business depending on loss activity in any particular period the combined ratio is the sum of the composite ratio and the underwriting expense ratio the combined ratio measures the total profitability of our underwriting operations and does not take into account corporate expenses net investment income or any foreign exchange gain or loss given the nature of our unique underwriting strategy we expect that our combined ratio may also be volatile from period to period financial condition   investments financial contracts receivable financial contracts payable due to prime brokers   our long investments and financial contracts receivable reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of march    were  million  compared to  million as of december    an increase of  million  or    return to table of contents the significant changes in our long investments and financial contracts receivable for the three months ended march   were as follows increase decrease  in millions   explanation    commodities  gold   decrease primarily due to the reduction of physical gold holdings    financial contracts receivable   decrease in derivative assets partially due to the decrease in unrealized gains relating to derivatives held as of march      equities  listed   increase primarily due to acquisition of equity securities    corporate debt   decrease due to disposal of certain corporate debt instruments as of march    our exposure to long investments decreased to   compared to  as of december    this exposure analysis is conducted on a deltaadjusted basis and excludes macro positions which consist of cds interest rate swaps sovereign debt currencies commodities volatility indexes and derivatives on any of these instruments therefore a change in the exposure may not directly translate into a corresponding change in the long investments   financial contracts payable as of march   increased by  million  or   compared to december    primarily due to a total return equity swaps that depreciated in value and were reclassified from financial contracts receivable to financial contracts payable as of march    from time to time we incur indebtedness to our prime brokers to implement our investment strategy in accordance with our investment guidelines additionally under term margin agreements we pledge certain investment securities to borrow cash from prime brokers in order to provide collateral for trust accounts and for some of our letters of credit outstanding the borrowed amount is held in accounts for the benefit of the beneficiaries and is included in the restricted cash and cash equivalents balance on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of  march    we had borrowed  million  december     million  from our prime brokers for investing activities including short positions and to provide collateral for trust accounts and letters of credit the increase in the amount borrowed from prime brokers was partially a result of the higher level of margin borrowing required for the current composition of the investment portfolio as of march   and partially a result of the increase in collateral provided to our cedents in the form of trusts and letters of credit in accordance with greenlight re’s investment guidelines in effect as of march    dme advisors may employ up to  gril  net margin leverage for extended periods of time and up to  gril  net margin leverage relating to investing activities for periods of less than  days   our investment portfolio including any derivatives is valued at fair value and any unrealized gains or losses are reflected in net investment income loss in the condensed consolidated statements of income as of march       december      of our investment portfolio excluding restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was comprised of investments valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets level     december      was comprised of securities valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices level  and    december      was comprised of securities valued based on nonobservable inputs level  as of march      december      of our investment portfolio was comprised of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient refer to note  “financial instruments” in the condensed consolidated financial statements for details of transfers into and out of level  during the three months ended march      in determining whether a market for a financial instrument is active or inactive we obtain information from dme advisors based on feedback it receives from executing brokers market makers analysts and traders to assess the level of market activity and available liquidity for any given financial instrument where a financial instrument is valued based on broker quotes dme advisors requests multiple quotes the ultimate value is based on an average of the quotes obtained broker quoted prices are generally not adjusted in determining the ultimate values and are obtained with the expectation of the quotes being binding as of march     million  december     million  of our investments longs shorts and derivatives were valued based on broker quotes of which  million  december     million  were based on broker quotes that utilized observable market information and classified as level  fair value measurements and   return to table of contents million  december     million  were based on broker quotes that utilized nonobservable inputs and classified as level  fair value measurements   nonobservable inputs used by our investment advisor include the use of investment manager statements and management estimates based on third party appraisals of underlying assets for valuing private equity investments  securities sold not yet purchased restricted cash and cash equivalents as of march    our securities sold not yet purchased were  million  compared to  million at december    however the short exposure decreased to  as of march    compared to  at december    primarily due to the increase in assets under management by our investment advisor the exposure analysis is conducted on a deltaadjusted basis and excludes macro positions which consist of cds interest rate swaps sovereign debt currencies commodities volatility indexes and derivatives on any of these instruments therefore a change in the exposure may not directly translate into a corresponding change in the securities sold not yet purchased unlike long investments short sales theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since there is no limit as to how high the market price of a security may rise while it is not possible to list all of the reasons why a loss on a short sale may occur a loss on a short sale may be caused by one or more of the following factors • fluctuations in the share price due to an overall positive investment market • sudden unexpected changes in the underlying business model of the issuer • changes in laws and regulations relating to short sales • press releases and earnings guidance issued by the issuer • a merger or acquisition of the issuer at a price in excess of the current share price • the shares of the issuer becoming difficult to borrow or • a short squeeze given the various scenarios under which a loss may occur on a short sale it is not possible to quantify the risk and uncertainty of loss relating to short sales however dme advisors typically performs a detailed analysis prior to entering into a short sale thereafter the investment is routinely monitored by dme advisors as of march    greenlight re’s investment guidelines limit any single investment from constituting more than  of the portfolio  for gril’s portfolio at any given time which limits the potential adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position from any one position as of march    restricted cash included  million relating to collateral for securities sold not yet purchased compared to  million as of december    overall our restricted cash increased by  million  or   from  million to  million  partially due to the increase in collateral posted for our reinsurance obligations to our clients which increased by  million during the three months ended march    to a lesser extent the increase in restricted cash was caused by an increase in swap counterparty collateral which increased by  million  during the three months ended march      reinsurance balances receivable deferred acquisition costs net unearned premium reserves   at march    reinsurance balances receivable were  million  compared to  million as of december    an increase of  million  or   the increase in reinsurance balances receivable was primarily attributable to premiums on contracts currently in force including net premiums held by ceding insurers on certain deals that allow for funds to be withheld by the ceding insurer at march    funds withheld were  million compared to  million as of december    we believe the reinsurance balances receivable are fully collectible and no allowance for bad debt was considered necessary at march    at march    deferred acquisition costs net of retrocession increased by  million  or   compared to december    the increase was consistent with and related to the increase in unearned premium reserves during the same period we evaluate the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs by determining if the sum of future earned premiums and anticipated investment income is greater than the expected future claims and expenses if a loss is probable on the unexpired portion of policies in force a premium deficiency loss is recognized as of march    we believe that the deferred acquisition costs were fully recoverable and no premium deficiency loss was recorded  return to table of contents loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reinsurance balances payable   reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were comprised of the following table    march     december     case reserves   ibnr   total   case reserves   ibnr   total    in thousands frequency                       severity                 total                         during the three months ended march    the frequency loss reserves increased by  million  or   to  million from  million as of december    the increases in both case reserves and ibnr were primarily related to the premiums earned during the period on active frequency contracts the severity loss reserves increased by  million  or   primarily relating to case reserves for most of our contracts written as of march    our risk exposure is limited by defined limits of liability once the loss limit for a contract has been reached we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract however certain contracts particularly quota share contracts that relate to first dollar exposure may not contain aggregate limits our severity business and to a lesser extent our frequency business include certain contracts that contain or may contain natural peril loss exposure as of april    our maximum aggregate loss exposure to any series of natural peril events was  million  for purposes of the preceding sentence aggregate loss exposure is net of any retrocession including any ilws and is equal to the difference between the aggregate limits available in the contracts that contain natural peril exposure minus reinstatement premiums if any for the same contracts we categorize peak zones as united states canada and the caribbean europe japan and the rest of the world the following table provides single event loss exposure and aggregate loss exposure information for the peak zones of our natural peril coverage as of april         april   zone   maximum single event loss   maximum aggregate loss      in thousands united states canada and the caribbean         europe       japan       rest of the world       maximum aggregate       since our maximum loss exposures are theoretical maximums based on contract limits these limits may be significantly higher than modeled loss estimates which are commonly used in the insurance industry therefore we also estimate catastrophe losses in terms of the probable maximum loss “pml” we define pml as the anticipated loss taking into account contract terms and limits caused by a catastrophe affecting a broad geographic area such as that caused by an earthquake or hurricane we anticipate that the pml will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the composition of the inforce book of business the projected severity levels are described in terms of a in year return period the in year return period pml means that there is a  chance in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate in other words it corresponds to a  probability that the loss from an event will fall below the indicated pml pmls are estimates and as a result we cannot provide any assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event pml the pml estimate includes all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations this includes coverage for property motor marine energy aviation and workers’ compensation  return to table of contents as of april    our estimated net pml exposure net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums at a in year return period for a single event and in aggregate was  million and  million  respectively the following table provides the pml for single event

balance sheet which includes noncontrolling interest increased by  million to  million as of march    compared to  million as of december    retained earnings increased primarily due to net income of  million reported for the three months ended march    the noncontrolling interest increased by  million primarily due the net investment income attributable to the noncontrolling interest for three months ended march    the increase in additional paidin capital for the three months ended march   of  million was primarily related to sharebased compensation for the three months ended march    liquidity and capital resources   general greenlight capital re is organized as a holding company with no operations of its own as a holding company greenlight capital re has minimal continuing cash needs most of which are related to the payment of administrative expenses all of our underwriting operations are conducted through our whollyowned reinsurance subsidiaries greenlight re and gril which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance there are restrictions on each of greenlight re’s and gril’s ability to pay dividends which are described in more detail below it is our current policy to retain earnings to support the growth of our business we currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares as of  march    greenlight re and gril were each rated “a excellent” with a stable outlook by am best the ratings reflect am best’s opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries’ financial strength operating performance and ability to meet obligations and it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy sell or hold our class a ordinary shares if am best downgrades our ratings below “a excellent” or withdraws our rating we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts which would significantly and negatively affect our business our am best ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency  sources and uses of funds   our sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts net of brokerage and ceding commissions investment income net of advisory compensation and investment expenses including realized gains and other income we use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses profit commissions and general and administrative expenses substantially all of our funds including shareholders’ capital net of funds required for business operations are invested by dme advisors in accordance with our investment guidelines as of march    approximately   december      of our long investments were comprised of publiclytraded equity securities and other holdings which can be readily liquidated to meet current and future liabilities given our valueoriented long and short investment strategy if markets are distressed we would expect the liability of the short portfolio to decline any reduction in the liability would cause our need for restricted cash to decrease and thereby free up cash to be used for any purpose additionally since the majority of our invested assets can be readily liquidated even in distressed markets we believe sufficient securities can be readily sold or covered in a timely manner to generate cash to pay claims since we classify our investments as “trading” we book all gains and losses including unrealized gains and losses on all our investments including derivatives as net investment income or loss in our condensed consolidated statements of income for each reporting period      return to table of contents     for the three months ended march   and   the net cash provided by or used in operating activities was  million and  million  respectively included in the net cash used in operating activities were investment related expenses such as investment advisor compensation and net interest and dividend expenses of  million and  million for the three months ended march   and   respectively excluding the investment related expenses from the net cash from operating activities the net cash primarily provided by used in our underwriting activities was  million and  million for the three months ended march   and   respectively generally in a given period if the premiums collected are sufficient to cover claim payments we would generate cash from our underwriting activities due to the inherent nature of our underwriting portfolio claims are often paid several months or even years after the premiums are collected the cash generated from underwriting activities however may be volatile from period to period depending on the underwriting opportunities available for the three months ended march    our investing activities used cash of  million    provided cash of  million  driven primarily by increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to the same period in   cash used for or provided by investing activities is net of any withdrawals from the joint venture by dme  nil for three months ended march   and   there were no financing activities during the three months ended march   and       as of march    we believe we have sufficient cash flow from operating and investing activities to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements we expect that our operational needs for liquidity will be met by cash funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income including realized gains and the disposition of investment securities as of march    we had no plans to issue debt and expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from operating cash flow however we cannot provide assurances that in the future we will not incur indebtedness to implement our business strategy pay claims or make acquisitions   although glre is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends greenlight re and gril are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay dividends to us in addition any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to payment as of march    greenlight re and gril both exceeded the regulatory minimum capital requirements  letters of credit and trust arrangements   as of march    neither greenlight re nor gril was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than the cayman islands and the european economic area respectively because many jurisdictions do not permit domestic insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless appropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or nonadmitted insurers we anticipate that all of our us clients and some of our nonus clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld trust arrangements letters of credit or a combination thereof as of march    we had three  letter of credit facilities available with an aggregate capacity of  million  december     million  with various financial institutions see note  of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for details on each of the available facilities we provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements as of march    the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was  million  december     million  the letters of credit and trust accounts are secured by equity and debt securities as well as cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of  million as of march    december     million  each of the letter of credit facilities contain customary events of default and restrictive covenants including but not limited to limitations on liens on collateral transactions with affiliates mergers and sales of assets as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum pledged equity requirements and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider additionally if an event of default exists as defined in the letter of credit facilities greenlight re would be prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company the company was in compliance with all the covenants of each of these facilities as of march        return to table of contents capital   our capital structure currently consists entirely of equity issued in two separate classes of ordinary shares we expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable future consequently we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any material indebtedness in the ordinary course of our business other than temporary borrowing directly related to the management of our investment portfolio however in order to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes we have filed a form s registration statement which expires in june  unless renewed we did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the three months ended march    our board of directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the company to repurchase up to  million class a ordinary shares or securities convertible into class a ordinary shares in the open market through privately negotiated transactions or rule b stock trading plans the current share repurchase plan expires on june   unless renewed by the board of directors as of march     million class a ordinary shares remained authorized for repurchase under the repurchase plan the company is not required to repurchase any of the class a ordinary shares and the repurchase plan may be modified suspended or terminated at the election of our board of directors at any time without prior notice during the three months ended march    no class a ordinary shares were repurchased by the company as of  march    there were  class a ordinary shares available for future issuance under the company’s stock incentive plan on april   our shareholders approved an amendment to our stock incentive plan to increase the number of class a ordinary shares available for issuance from  million to  million the stock incentive plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors    contractual obligations and commitments   the following table shows our aggregate contractual

agreements as described below          as of march    we had made total commitments of  million in private investments of which we had invested  million  and our remaining commitments to these investments total  million  given the nature of private equity commitments we are unable to determine with any degree of accuracy as to when the commitments will be called as such for the purposes of the above table we have assumed that all commitments with no fixed payment schedule will be made within one year under our investment guidelines in effect as of the date hereof no more than  of the assets in the investment portfolio may be held in private equity securities without specific approval from the board of directors        due to the nature of our reinsurance operations the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate perhaps materially and therefore are highly uncertain as of march     million of securities sold not yet purchased were secured by  million of restricted cash held by prime brokers to cover obligations relating to securities sold not yet purchased these amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above because there is no maturity date for securities sold not yet purchased and their maturities are not set by any contract and as such their due dates cannot be estimated   greenlight re has entered into lease agreements for office space in the cayman islands the leases expire on june   and greenlight re has the option to renew the leases for a further five year term

under operating lease obligations and in note  to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements   the company and its reinsurance subsidiaries are party to a joint venture agreement with dme advisors and a separate investment advisory agreement with dme effective january   the venture agreement and the advisory agreement were amended and restated to replace the previous agreements dated january   and will expire on december   and renew automatically for successive threeyear periods pursuant to the venture agreement we pay dme advisors a monthly management fee of  on our share of the assets managed by dme advisors and we provide dme a performance allocation equal to  of the net profit calculated per annum of the company’s share of the capital account managed by dme advisors subject to a loss carry forward provision the loss carry forward provision allows dme to earn a reduced performance allocation of  of profits in any year subsequent to the year in which the investment account incurs a loss until all the losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to  of the aggregate investment loss is earned dme is not entitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which the investment portfolio incurs a loss for the three months ended march    performance allocation of  million and management fees of  million were included in net investment income   we have entered into a service agreement with dme advisors pursuant to which dme advisors will provide investor relations services to us for compensation of  per month plus expenses the service agreement had an initial term of one year and continues for sequential oneyear periods until terminated by us or dme advisors either party may terminate the service agreement for any reason with  days prior written notice to the other party our related party transactions are presented in note  to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements offbalance sheet financing arrangements   we have no obligations assets or liabilities other than those derivatives in our investment portfolio that are disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements which would be considered offbalance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements  effects of inflation   we consider the effects of inflation in our pricing and when estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the actual effects of inflation on our results of operations cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled for the three months ended march   and   inflation had no significant impact on our revenues or net income we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a material effect on our combined results of operations except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates and the asset values in our investment portfolio item     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we believe we are principally exposed to the following types of market risk  •   equity price risk •   commodity price risk •   foreign currency risk •   interest rate risk •   credit risk and •   political risk    return to table of contents equity price risk as of march    our investment portfolio consisted of long and short equity securities along with certain equitybased derivative instruments the carrying values of which are primarily based on quoted market prices generally market prices of common equity securities are subject to fluctuation which could cause the amount to be realized upon the closing of the position to differ significantly from their current reported value this risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity securities within our investment portfolio as of march    a  decline in the price of each of these listed equity securities and equitybased derivative instruments would result in a  million  or   decline in the fair value of our total investment portfolio   computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical equity price changes are based on numerous assumptions including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of investment securities and should not be relied on as indicative of future results commodity price risk generally market prices of commodities are subject to fluctuation our investment portfolio periodically includes long or short investments in commodities or in derivatives directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of commodities as of march    our investment portfolio included unhedged exposure to changes in gold prices through ownership of physical gold and derivative instruments with underlying exposure to changes in gold prices additionally as of march    our investment portfolio included derivative instruments with underlying exposure to changes in natural gas and oil prices the following table summarizes the net impact that a  increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on the value of our investment portfolio as of march    the below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in commodity prices might have on equity securities in our investment portfolio

periodically monitor our exposure to any other commodity price fluctuations and generally do not expect changes in other commodity prices to have a materially adverse impact on our operations   foreign currency risk certain of our reinsurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable or calculated in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that our foreign currency loss reserves case reserves and ibnr are in excess of the corresponding foreign currency cash balances and there is an increase in the exchange rate of that foreign currency as of march    we had a net unhedged foreign currency exposure on gbp denominated loss reserves of £ million  as of march    a  decrease in the us dollar against the gbp all else being constant would result in additional estimated loss reserves of  million and a corresponding foreign exchange loss alternatively a  increase in the us dollar against the gbp would result in a reduction of  million in our recorded loss reserves and a corresponding foreign exchange gain   while we do not seek to specifically match our liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments denominated in such currencies we continually monitor our exposure to potential foreign currency losses and may use foreign currency cash and cash equivalents or forward foreign currency exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate against adverse foreign currency movements    return to table of contents we are also exposed to foreign currency risk through cash forwards options and investments in securities denominated in foreign currencies foreign currency exchange rate risk is the potential for adverse changes in the us dollar value of investments long and short speculative foreign currency options and cash positions due to a change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which cash and financial instruments are denominated as of march    some of our currency exposure resulting from foreign denominated securities longs and shorts was reduced by offsetting cash balances denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies  the following table summarizes the net impact that a  increase and decrease in the value of the us dollar against select foreign currencies would have on the value of

the maintenance of the existing level and composition of investment securities denominated in foreign currencies and related foreign currency instruments and should not be relied on as indicative of future results   interest rate risk our investment portfolio includes interest rate sensitive securities such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments and interest rate options the primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk as interest rates rise the market value of our long fixedincome portfolio falls and the opposite is also true as interest rates fall additionally some of our derivative investments may also be sensitive to interest rates and their value may indirectly fluctuate with changes in interest rates  the following table summarizes the

determined based on the interest rates applicable to each instrument individually we periodically monitor our net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect changes in interest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations    return to table of contents credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us the amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of our financial assets including notes receivable we evaluate the financial condition of our notes receivable counterparties and monitor our exposure to them on a regular basis we are also exposed to credit risk from our business partners and clients relating to balances receivable under the reinsurance contracts including premiums receivable losses recoverable and commission adjustments recoverable we monitor the collectability of these balances on a regular basis in addition the securities commodities and cash in our investment portfolio are held with several prime brokers subjecting us to the related credit risk from the possibility that one or more of them may default on their obligations to us we closely and regularly monitor our concentration of credit risk with each prime broker and if necessary transfer cash or securities between prime brokers to diversify and mitigate our credit risk other than our investment in derivative contracts and corporate debt if any and the fact that our investments and majority of cash balances are held by prime brokers on our behalf we have no other significant concentrations of credit risk  political risk we are exposed to political risk to the extent that we underwrite business from entities located in foreign markets and to the extent that dme advisors on our behalf and subject to our investment guidelines trades securities that are listed on various us and foreign exchanges and markets the governments in any of these jurisdictions could impose restrictions regulations or other measures which may have a material adverse impact on our underwriting operations and investment strategy we currently do not write political risk coverage on our insurance contracts however changes in government laws and regulations may impact our underwriting operations see “item a risk factors” included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december      item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   as required by rules a and d of the exchange act the company has evaluated with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in such rules as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake   additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected    return to table of contents changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting the company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures including its internal controls over

collect funds owing to us in other matters we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights while the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty we
