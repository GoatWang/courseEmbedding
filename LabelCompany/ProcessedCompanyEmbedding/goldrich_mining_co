been publicly disclosed by the company and enough time has elapsed to allow investors to react to the information for directors and employees who have regular access to sensitive nonpublic information trading in company securities may give the appearance of impropriety such people should not trade where the risk of the appearance of impropriety is high to ensure that directors and employees who may be in possession of material nonpublic information do not trade in company securities any transaction in company securities by a director or executive officer must be precleared with the companys secretary prior to the transaction any other employee who has questions concerning the propriety of buying or selling company securities should address questions to the companys secretary before executing the trade in addition no employee or director may give tips or nonpublic company information to anyone whether inside or outside of the company to enable the recipient of the tip to buy or sell company securities based on material nonpublic information employees and directors should therefore be very careful when discussing information that could influence someone elses decision to buy sell or hold company securities the timing of the release of information is especially important and only the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer have the authority to determine when information should be released employees and directors should assume that all company information is internal and confidential unless the company has authorized written public disclosure of that information prohibitions on trading in securities based on nonpublic information also extend to securities of the companys competitors and business associates accordingly employees and directors should not buy or sell securities in another company about which the employee or director knows the company has material nonpublic information corporate opportunities and conflicts of interest employees and directors owe the company a duty to advance the companys business interests when the opportunity to do so arises as a result employees and directors are prohibited from taking personal advantage of certain business opportunities in which the company may be interested this socalled corporate opportunity doctrine is complicated and it is not possible to clearly define all of the business opportunities which belong or could be of interest to the company and what business opportunities may be taken advantage of personally by employees or directors the most common types of situations falling within this corporate opportunity doctrine prohibit employees and directors from i personally taking advantage of any business opportunity that typically would be pursued by or would be of interest to the company ii personally taking advantage of any other business opportunity that the company may want to take advantage of if the opportunity is discovered using company property business contacts or information or that the employee becomes aware of because he or she works for the company or that a director becomes aware of in his or her capacity as a director of the company or iii competing with or otherwise disadvantaging the company if an employee or director has any question regarding whether this corporate opportunity doctrine applies to any potential business opportunity he or she should consult with the companys counsel although employees and directors are free to participate in outside activities it is important that employees and directors not engage in any activity that is or could appear to be a conflict between personal interests and the companys best interests examples of conflicts of interest include being a consultant to or a director officer or employee of or otherwise operating an outside businessthat supplies products or services to the company that purchases products or services from the company seeking or accepting any personal loan or services from any such outside business except from financial institutions or service providers offering similar loans or services to third parties under similar terms in the ordinary course of their respective businesses being a consultant to or a director officer or employee of or otherwise operating an outside business if the demands of the outside business would interfere with the directors or employees responsibilities with the company accepting any personal loan or guarantee of obligations from the company except to the extent such arrangements are legally permissible conducting business on behalf of the company with immediate family members which include spouses children parents siblings and persons sharing the same home whether or not legal relatives using the companys property information or position for personal gain actual or potential conflicts of interest including but not limited to any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflicting interest must be reported to the responsible manager or the companys counsel approval of potential conflicts involving employees that are executive officers or directors will be made exclusively by the corporate governance committee of the board of directors company information and company property company information is a valuable asset it encompasses all

act to facilitate the provision of full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the company files with or submits to the securities and exchange commission and in other public communications made by the company business with government and officials most countries around the world have laws that prohibit employees from giving gifts or inducements to influence government officials or to induce the purchase of the companys products or services the term government official includes employees and other representatives of foreign governments or agencies thereof candidates for political office political parties and employees and other representatives of public international organizations inducements or benefits are also broadly defined to include anything of value even it were not illegal in other countries the company does not want to obtain or retain business by giving gifts to officials of a government or a multinational organization either to influence any of their official acts or to induce them to use their influence to affect any governmental act in addition employees should never give a gift to any person or firm where he or she knows or has reason to believe that the gift will be passed on to a government official for such purposes employees and directors must never make improper gifts or payments such as bribes or kickbacks in any way in connection with the companys business gifts or payments to or for the personal benefit of a governmental official or to or for the personal benefit of an employee of one of the companys customers or suppliers are clearly improper indirect transactions such as payments of commissions to a sales representative on the understanding that he or she will pay a bribe or kickback to an employee of a customer are also prohibited governmental investigations while it is the companys policy to cooperate in the administration of all laws and regulations to which it is subject such cooperation must be conducted in a manner that does not unduly interfere with the business of the company nor jeopardize its legitimate interests employees who receive notice of any governmental investigation involving the company or any request to testify in a legal proceeding with regard to the company should promptly notify the responsible manager and the companys counsel if a governmental investigator requests an interview or information he or she should be treated courteously but should be given no information except that which is publicly available and instead should be requested to put his inquiry in writing in order that it may be answered with appropriate care by proper persons preferably acting with the advice of legal counsel gifts and gratuities employees and directors should avoid any relationship activity or investment that might conflict with their responsibilities to the company or impair their abilities to act independently in the best interests of the company for example employees and directors should not accept significant gifts entertainment favors or other gratuities from persons doing business or seeking to do business with the company nor should an employee or director have a conflicting interest in an actual or potential competitor supplier or customer of the company acceptance of gratuities having only nominal value if consistent

by an appropriate company representative fees or other compensation received from an organization in which membership or an official position is held subject to prior written approval by an appropriate company representative employees or associates who believe that acceptance of a permitted gift might make them feel obligated and therefore improperly influenced in the performance of
