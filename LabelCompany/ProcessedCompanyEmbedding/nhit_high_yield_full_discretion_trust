refine search high yield investments high yield investments offer additional income but high returns go hand in hand with greater risks too many people get caught up in the yield as if it was free money its notwhen you evaluate investments that appear to pay more you should approach them like sherlock holmes with a healthy degree of skepticism as there are realistic cause and effect relationships the return is higher because the risk is higher be sure to question everything and pay attention to the detailsdoing your detective work means knowing how the high yield investment generates its returns and what factors would cause those returns to go down or up you should only consider buying after you understand these factors such as financial operating condition industry

income one that doesn’t is nuveen municipal value fund nuv   which mostly buys highquality longterm bonds although at first glance the fund’s yield seems to disqualify it from this group you really need to look at its taxableequivalent yield—what someone would have to earn from a taxable bond to equal the yield of a taxfree bond in this case  is the equivalent of a  taxable yield for someone in the  federal tax bracket and  for an investor in the top  bracket treasury inflation protected securities tipsthe us treasury has several types of bond investments for you to choose from one of the
