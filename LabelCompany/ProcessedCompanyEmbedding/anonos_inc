anonos anonos enables new ways to unlock maximum data value anonos patented bigprivacy technology is the only system that enables data analytics use in compliance with evolving regulations like the gdpr what bigprivacy achieves bigprivacy supports alternative legal bases for data use when consent is not a valid legal basis under the eu general data protection regulation gdpr bigprivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in realtime to comply with differing and evolving regulations gdpr hipaa other and restrictions bigprivacy enables access to additional and more accurate sources of data due to the technically controlled separation of information value from identifiers that link back to sensitive data sources are now able to provide access to and use of more valuable data bigprivacy enables broader distribution of enhanced data assets by technically enforcing compliance with restrictions and regulations controlling data flows at the source data element level ensures use of the minimum identifying information necessary for each authorized access enabling the creation of new data sets and subsets since access rights are no longer all or nothing bigprivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in realtime to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions bigprivacy protects against liability from improper access to and use of data whether data is collected directly or received from third parties joint and several liability and data breach obligations exist without adequate privacy safeguards and compliance with data protection by default requirements bigprivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in realtime to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions compliance does not have to be an obstacle to growth anonos successfully implements new technology required under evolving regulations like the gdrp to turn compliance into a business facilitator that enables growth anonos bigprivacy is the first of its kind technology that enforces data flow controls to maximize data use in a privacy respectful compliant manner decouple data patented dynamically changing identifiers decouple data representation from its underlying value securing and protecting sensitive data elements that could be used to link data back to individuals bigprivacy controls unauthorized linking of data which is the result with static identifiers without degrading the value of data which is the result of other solutions derisk data patented finegrain controls derisk data by ensuring that only the minimum level of identifying information necessary to support each authorized data access is exposed bigprivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in realtime to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions control sharing only data elements necessary to support each authorized access are exposed at the time of use with secure centrallymanaged keys bigprivacy maximizes information value while minimizing identifiability reconciling conflicts between protecting privacy and data use data flow controls are necessary because traditional contractpolicy restrictions do not flow with data over its life cycle “with anonos i can generate new revenue sources because we can now granularly control how we share data sets” head of business development for fortune  company benefits bigprivacy improves datadriven innovation by enabling access to and use of additional sources and more accurate information for analytics artificial intelligence machine learning and other secondary uses of data bigprivacy maximizes data asset revenue growth by enabling the multipurpose use of data for all strategic needs anonos bigprivacy is a firstofitskind patented technology platform that enables robust data collection use and sharing of data in compliance with differing and evolving international eg the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” and domestic common rule hipaa regulatory requirements and contractual restrictions bigprivacy technically enables compliance with data privacy and governance policies and procedures bigprivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically adjust the granularity of data exposed in realtime to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions bigprivacy complements perimeter network and endpoint security technologies by protecting data in use to achieve security goals of confidentiality integrity and availability of information over the full life cycle of data how bigprivacy compares to other technologies all other technologies distort and degrade the value of data analytics artificial intelligence machine learning and secondary uses of data they limit access to and use of representative data and fail to satisfy security and privacy requirements under industry specific hipaa and jurisdiction specific gdpr legal regimes contact us to learn more “with anonos i can greenlight all the projects that business wants to do but have been shelved due to compliance issues” privacy head for top global payments company overcome limitations of consent consent no longer supports lawful data analytics under the gdpr anonos patented bigprivacy technology is the only solution that converts personal data to legitimate interest processing so analytics can be done other solutions do not enable realtime analytics or use of historical data bases collected using pregdpr noncompliant consent global multijurisdictional support the benefits of anonos bigprivacy’s ability to control the linkability of a data by leveraging capabilities embodied in the gdpr definitions of pseudonymisation and data protection by default extend beyond gdpr compliance to enable controls necessary for secondary uses of data underlying the new global digital economy – including complying with emerging data protection laws and established regimes like hipaa us and pipeda canada ask other vendors how they satisfy gdpr technical requirements for data protection by default and dynamic pseudonymisation necessary to convert personal data to legitimate interest processing why others cant enable gdpr compliant analytics data protection by default vs privacy by design be wary of vendors who highlight compliance with privacy by design but not data protection by default they are very different the gdpr mandates the most strict implementation of privacy by design called data protection by default which requires realtime use case specific fine grain control over use of personal data dynamic vs static pseudonymisation if a vendor claims to pseudonymise data to comply with the gdpr check if they use staticstateless tokens or dynamically changing tokens only the latter satisfy new gdpr requirements that the information value of data be separated from the ability to attribute data back to individuals via the mosaic effect securityonly solutions personal data under the gdpr extends beyond data that is directly linked to data subjects to also include information that is indirectly linkable to data subjects encryption hashing staticstateless tokenization data masking and other security techniques help protect against unauthorized reidentification using direct identifiers they do nothing to protect against unauthorized reidentification via linkage attacks by correlating indirect quasi identifiers as required under the gdpr definition of personal data anonymisation this word means something very different under eu law if a vendor claims they make your data anonymous that likely means you are only able to do aggregated analysis and do not have the ability to relink to individuals use cases general data protection regulation gdpr many companies “scramble” to conduct data inventory assessments and data protection impact assessments without realizing that inventories and assessments do nothing to support new legal bases required under the gdpr to continue making desired use of personal data requirements for gdprcompliant consent is impossible to satisfy for iterative data analytics analytics artificial intelligence ai or machine learning ml because successive analysis correlations and computations are not capable of being described with specificity and unambiguity at the time of consent in addition the gdpr has no “grandfather” provision allowing for continued use of data collected using noncompliant consent prior to the effective date of the gdpr to process gdprcompliant analytics ai and ml and to continue legally using historical data bases containing eu personal data new technology is required that supports alternate nonconsent gdprcompliant legal bases anonos bigprivacy is the only technology that can satisfy alternate nonconsent legal bases for gdprcompliant analytics ai and ml and enable ongoing legal use of historical data the anonos bigprivacy platform embodies  granted patents covering core capabilities necessary to support gdpr requirements for pseudonymisation and data protection by default even in situations where a company is not required to comply with eu regulations compliance with gdpr requirements is evidence of stateoftheart initiatives to serve as a good steward of data thereby engendering maximum trust with customers digital intelligencemarketing and sales sharing “digital intelligence” data ie capturing integrating and analyzing data to drive measurement optimization and execution of marketing and sales tactics and strategies can create significant liability in the us this is exemplified by the  million fine imposed by the ftc on vizio for sharing indirectly identifying information ip addresses with a third party for analytics purposes in the eu data controllers and processors are jointly and severally liable for failure of one another to comply with new gdpr requirements including obligations to support direct oneonone relationships with and expansive new rights of individual data subjects however the gdpr provides a means for data controllers to share data with third parties for analytics ai ml and other legitimate purposes who do not have relationships with data subjects if such third parties “are not able to identify data subjects” anonos bigprivacy is the only technology that can

data privacy and value dynamic deidentification and anonymity eliminates for the first time tradeoffs between protecting individuals anonymity and maximizing the value of underlying data jul    et from anonos inc     facebook twitter pinterest washington july   prnewswire  anonos inc wwwanonoscom the inventor of technologies that unlock the true value of data without compromising privacy announced today that it has been issued us patents for its pioneering solutions to architecturally enforce controlled conditions capable of satisfying even the most stringent united states and european union data privacy regulations logo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhlogo anonos ceo gary lafever commented the biggest data security challenge confronting global enterprises in the medical pharmaceutical finance and consumer markets is protecting individual privacy without sacrificing the value of that data stringent united states and european union privacy regulations have forced an unacceptable but until now necessary tradeoff between either more privacy and less value or more value with insufficient privacy anonos patented and patentpending technologies solve this problem for the first time unlocking the value of data while substantially increasing privacy and security by reducing reidentification risk to nearzero anonos technology and intellectual property works by producing deidentified but fully usable data with no greater likelihood of reidentification than that of highly encrypted data yet while anonos is fully compatible with all methods of encryption it neither relies upon nor requires encryption itself rather anonos architecturally enforces desired levels of data privacy security and value while enabling authorized trusted third parties to enforce policies at a granular data element level using a much wider range of quantifiable policy controls than previously possible anonos solutions thus unlock the true value of data transforming it into business intelligence by replacing oldstyle static access controls with technologically enforced dynamic permissions applied perelement and peruse instead of across entire records or applications this dramatically reduces the value of data to attackers while enabling compliancedriven access controls and protecting personal information from unauthorized and inappropriate use anonos dynamic deidentification and anonymity  justintimeidentity jiti technologies and intellectual property enforce privacy policies dynamic and concurrent architecturally enforced policies enable access control per data element and table instance with unlimited instances available simultaneously on demand enhance security source data is intentionally worthless to unauthorized parties and freely portable when decoupled from the jiti enforcement ecosystem even in cases where super users have broad visibility due to revocation of ephemeral key credentials enable privacy  security respectful innovation data utility is maximized as a matter of policy compliance commercial and societal objectives without hindrance by restrictive and inflexible security controls potential use cases  applications of anonos technology and intellectual property data breach hack damage reduction organizations like anthem target home depot and even the us office of personnel management opm suffer when their facilities are breached as do their millions of subscribers  customers  citizens whose identities are hacked and data is kept in unencrypted form to enable use of the data as a result attackers can gain unauthorized access to personal data in cleartext form – ie unencrypted information that is in the clear and understandable in contrast to standard encryption which is generally fully on or off or traditional data masking techniques which do not protect data at the database level anonos justintimeidentity jiti technology and intellectual property could help protect against data loss from external breaches without losing use of data for authorized purposes within the organization with jiti an attacker may gain access to data but would not gain access to jiti keys kept securely in separate virtual or physical locations necessary to reveal personal information protection of credit card user identities the january  science journal see httpwwwsciencemagorgcontentabstract includes a three month study of credit card records for  million people that shows four spatiotemporal points are enough to uniquely reidentify  of credit card customers anonos dynamic deidentifiers ddids could deidentify credit card customers for each transaction – providing a justintimeidentity jiti for each transaction as a result customers could not be reidentified by means of correlating static anonymous identifiers the anonos approach makes limiting the ability to single out link or infer a data subject a policy choice instead of a statistical risk see httpwwwanonoscomunicity for an interactive version of this example mobile os tools the trend between the two major mobile operating systems ios and android is to encrypt personal data both on the device and in the cloud environments of the platform operators application developers however are generally free to bypass these controls either by using their own libraries for interaction with datadriven applications or by using proxies and vpns to conceal their information queries a privacyfriendly mobile os could be built whereby no data interactions were permitted unless they were enabled via anonos justintimeidentity jiti keys the platform operators would therefore be able to define quantifiable and enforceable conditions under which lawful intercept search and seizure would be permissible without the present risk of leakage and casual browsing of personal data by unauthorized users data subjects could therefore choose whether or not to share personal data not based on vague promises and murky assurances but instead based on concrete evaluations of the governance policies surrounding lawful intercept control could therefore be returned to the data subject and informed choices and consent could both be possible and revocable at any time and for usage of personal data within the mobile ecosystem at the same time technology companies and platform operators could have a positive constructive conversation with regulators about conditions under which authorized disclosure would be permitted and cascade those back down in plain simple language to the end users whose data would be affected about anonos anonos solves the problem of delivering data privacy and security while empowering users to leverage the full power of their data for companies anonos technology and intellectual property can transform information at the data element level to deliver security while preserving the value of underlying data for deep analysis for individuals anonos tools can provide controls for data subjects to share information in a controlled manner that allows them to receive personalized information services and offerings while protecting against misuse of their data anonos patented and patentpending technologies and

of projects and initiatives that leverage the power of ideas according to ted participants in its residency program are selected based on passion expertise the strength of their idea their character and their ability to bring a fresh perspective and positive contribution to the diverse ted community the anonos big idea worth spreading is bigprivacy™ said ted myerson cofounder of anonos bigprivacy is a softwarebased product that makes it easier to safely collect combine share and publish large volumes of data as big data paves the way for new discoveries in diverse disciplines anonos bigprivacy product enables breakthroughs in the life sciences including personalized and precision medicine while at the same time protecting the privacy of the sensitive data sources on which new insights depend said myerson dr jonas almeida professor and chief technology officer at the department of biomedical informatics at stony brook university and an advisor to the company observed anonos was ahead of the curve in anticipating the world awash in data that we live in today streams from myriad webenabled devices make it difficult to manage privacy through traditional access controls alone this is what excites me about anonos they saw deidentification as a way to bolster the governance of gigantic sensitive data ecosystems at a time when this scenario was only academic conjecture realizing the promise of big data depends on secure access to personal data including sensitive health data however outdated methods of privacy protection such as data masking traditional access controls and static deidentification undermine research by reducing the accuracy of data restricting access to data sets andor requiring the deletion of data minimizing its value anonos bigprivacy technology overcomes these limitations by dynamically de–identifying data maintaining a high level of accuracy and by separating data sets into components enabling selective access to varied gradations of sensitive information under controlled conditions restoring privacy protection to a realistic possibility rather than just an aspirational goal creates great value for both individuals and society said marty abrams executive director  chief strategist at information accountability foundation anonos selection for the ted residency is clear evidence that the companys vision and
