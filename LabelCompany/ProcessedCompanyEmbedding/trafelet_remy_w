 opalesquefebruary  by bailey mccann remy trafelet reopens hedge fund after  years if the name remy trafelet seems familiar you might remember him and his fund trafelet capital management a multibillion dollar longshort fund founded in  before that he became one of the youngest portfolio managers in fidelity’s history he started managing trafelet by the age of  now an older more selective trafelet is back with a slimmed down product offering and a focus on doing what he does best  pick stocks ive spent the last five years simplifying the business so i can get back to what i love doing which is focusing on stock picking so now its me and a handful of analysts trafelet says in an interview with opalesque at its height trafelet capital had us european and global focused funds along with some ancillary services then  hit and much of the firms assets came directly from big bank balance sheets once they started unravelling trafelet didnt put up gates instead he gave the banks the money they put in and started trimming the fat at that time and until just this month the fund was closed to new investors now with a new senior partner in place and a clearer focus hes opening it up but not to just anyone going forward we want to be more selective with investors and make sure our interests are aligned he says unlike a number of managers faced with steep competition for asset gathering trafelet doesnt necessarily need to raise a lot of capital to stay afloat instead he says he wants to focus on doing what he loves and letting investors in that share his views of the market these new investors are likely to be less risky than the bulge brackets he had before hes already seen his first commitment in addition to refocusing the fund trafelet brought on george brokaw as a senior partner who will handle more of the investor relations work brokaw was previously a managing director at highbridge capital management the new version of the firm will be called trafelet brokaw  co and will still focus on trafelets proven strategy of long term investments he explains that with the help of his analysts theyll look at a significant number of companies in a given year but from that only draw  big ideas all of those ideas are centered on us companies sometimes between them theyll see  companies a day  that includes site visits and meetings with management the team is market cap agnostic and almost industry agnostic were not looking at biotech pharma were looking more at solid companies with a good story were really focused on companies where wed like to own the whole company if we could we like ideas where there is good cash flow and were getting all of our money back in say three years he says pointing to the tribune companies as a recent idea were basically getting the cable asset for free there theyll also look at complex companies that require some significant financial modeling restructures turnarounds almost a private equity look  more than the average balance sheet calculator not all of the companies we look at have a lot of coverage but well do the work right now trafelet is more or less in his sweet spot he says he has no plans to return to the sprawling asset management style outfit he had before the crisis  hed rather spend the time looking at companies when asked where he sees the firm headed he said  instead of thinking five years out id rather think  years out and keep posting compounded returns the fund has returned just over  per year since inception     insider trading  trafelet remy w  form  sec filings home
