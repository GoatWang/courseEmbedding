provide additional color on our directtopatient marketing initiatives and wilson will then discuss our first quarter  results then we will open the call for questions we delivered a strong first quarter performance in line with our expectations and reflecting the continued demand for and growth potential of zadaxin and our core business zadaxin’s competitive positions remain strong with continued volume growth despite generic competition zadaxin’s doubledigit volume growth rate continued this quarter underscoring its strength as the leading branded thymalfasin with  volume share and more than a  value share we do face continued pricing pressure with tenders in two provinces recently announced at prices lower than the reference price with our distributor we cannot determine at this time with certainty when these prices will take effect or when they will impact prices in other provinces but we are likely to experience some effect of those lower prices at some point during the next few quarters we may also see some pressure on unit volumes in some areas as a result of reduced nationallevel reimbursement for thymalfasins we have demonstrated our ability to manage the various challenges of the china market effectively to date and we are continuing to focus on strategies to expand the market for zadaxin manage the impact of potential reimbursement changes and provincial pricing pressures and actively seek to participate in the provincial reimbursement negotiations for thymalfasins to maximize future reimbursement for zadaxin we further expect that pricing pressures on revenue in  will be offset at least in part through continued sharing of the burden with our china distributor and potentially through volume increases we are confident that zadaxin has significant growth potential as a differentiated high quality westernmanufactured brand in terms of specific tenders we are continuing all practice of evaluating participation on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the size and importance to our business in each province for example we’re participating in the fujian and guangdong tenders fujian is a smaller province and guangdong is a much larger province which represents an important business opportunity too large to neglect despite its pricing impact rely on processes outside of the tender approach and one where we would strive to offset a lower price for the potential for volume growth in our last quarter’s call we address the changes announced in february of this year to the national reimbursement drug list or nrdl as well as the central government mandate to complete reviews of all province reimbursement drug list of prdl by july  not unlike tenders which often get delayed initial feedback from the marketplace indicates that the province’s may take longer until later in  to complete their reviews which will be favorable for us but again like tenders once the new prdl rules will be implemented they could put further pressure on our business from more limitations to reimbursement these are the business realities for all mature drugs and are affecting all pharma companies in china on the other side however there are new positive changes underway for earlier reimbursement of innovative drugs which in the past situate close to  years before reimbursement became available the government is definitely allowing reimbursement for this new more recently approve drugs and changing the priorities for its reimbursement systems and these positive changes are also being seen for the regulatory pathways to get new product candidates approved and introduce into the market important for sciclone as well as all international pharma companies many of these easier regulatory rules leading to faster development times in china are available not only for local company but also for imported drugs on a high level most industry watchers expect that this will give a strong boost to the innovative companies in china finally when comparing these new expected rules of us fda and ema rules the western approaches remain simpler and have shorter sideline china is catching up a lot we believe we are well positioned not only to manage these pricing and reimbursement challenges through continued implementation of our wider and deeper strategy reaching into new geographies as well as new indications such as sepsis lymphoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer as well as our continued implementation of ecommerce initiatives but also to benefit from the regulatory changes for our earlier stage pipeline product such as pt we were pleased to see continued strong growth in our oncology portfolio in the first quarter and reflected an  increase in our combined pfizer and baxter business reflecting higher demand for our oncology products we believe our oncology business has been strengthened by the management and strategic enhancements we implemented and also from certain market dynamics that are driving the demand for higher quality products consistent with the government’s focus on ensuring quality in the pharma marketplace some poor quality cheap generic manufacturers have left the market and prescribers are increasingly turning to higher quality products we anticipate continued growth in oncology over time as the market continues to consolidate and as we introduce additional branded differentiated oncology product into the market as we noted last quarter the market introduction of dc bead to treat liver cancer is continuing to progress although slower than anticipated we are continuing implementation of our academicfocused marketing effort to build the market for dc bead as an alternative to conventional tace procedures using gels our medical scientific liaison stuff or msls are emphasizing data showing that the efficacy of dc bead is superior to the gel indiscernible in certain groups of patients we believe that use of microbead will expand over time as we noted last quarter the only local microbead competitor thus far calisphere was acquired by indiscernible a wellknown local oncology company we anticipate to see more direct marketing of microbead product which may accelerate physician acceptance and expand the market we intend to remain competitive especially with our strategy to expand the dc bead product offering with different bead sizes which are smaller as well as larger than the already marketed products these new dc bead sizes are expected to be approved within about one year and will then allow treating patients more individually with the best product size with a goal of achieving easy administration as well as enhancing safety and efficacy our pricing has remained quite favorable and we continue to belief that dc bead has very positive revenue potential for sciclone we’re pleased that angiomax bivalirudin continues to progress for potential approval as we noted last quarter our clinical trial applicationclinical trial waiver filing for angiomax was approved and we plan to file the nda in coming months which could lead to a potential approval by late  or early  we believe that angiomax are highly differentiated branded product which we license from medicine company has significant commercial potential as an anticoagulant for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or pci especially those patients who are at higher risk for bleeding events angiomax represents an attractive potential alternative for current treatment options in the large and growing pci market there are two currently approved generic bivalirudins on the market one from shenzen salubris and one from jiangsu hangzhou we believe that given angiomax superior profile we should be able to price sell a product at a premium to these competitors a next important cardiovascular development opportunity is anticipated to be new part in which is currently in a patient phase  registration trial we expect an interim analysis in the second quarter of  which should determine next steps and the timeline for registration including the possibility of stopping the trial early for efficacy or continuing the trial as planned among others neucardin is a novel firstinclass therapy for chronic heart failure which we license from zensun science  technology company limited which has been shown to improve cardiac function reverse ventricular remodeling and increase survival we’re pleased note that the phase  clinical trial of loramyc required for china registration has been completed and the clinical study report or csr is being prepared for filing for the cfda as anticipated we believe we will be in a position to file an nda for loramyc to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis in coming months which could put us on a path for approval in the second half of  timeframe as we noted last quarter we are pursuing a standard import drug license approach for vibativ theravance which could likely lead to an approval in about  to  years our earlier stage pipeline is moving along led by the free novel oncology assets being inlicense sgx pt and abtl all three compounds have the potential to meaningfully expand our oncology business and diversify our development portfolio pt and abtl are taking advantage of class  regulatory pathways for products that are locally manufactured as these products are aligned with the china government focused on fostering innovation they can potentially move more quickly through development and regulatory process and gain more favorable pricing as i noted earlier especially faster reimbursement for such new drugs consider innovative could provide a substantial boost and fast uptake of commercial sales once approved sgx is a novel firstinclass therapy being developed for the treatment of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancers which we license from soligenex for greater china taiwan south korea and vietnam just recently soligenix reported that it has received us food and drug administration clearance to advance the pivotal phase  clinical trial evaluating sgx for the treatment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients being treated with chemoradiation soligenix plans to begin this study in the second quarter of  and this may help to shorten our time line for china approval as an imported drug pt is a multitargeted platinumpyrophosphate anticancer agent which we inlicensed from phosplatin therapeutics and which is actively enrolling a phase  proof of concept trial in taiwan as we previously noted we are awaiting review of the ind application by the cfda after which we intend to begin the phase  clinical program in china the ind for pt is our first class i regulatory submission and represents a major milestone for sciclone in positioning us as a local company we plan to enroll patients with various tumor types in the phase  portion and patients with liver cancer in the phase  portion liver cancer is a critical public health challenge in china and we are hopeful that pt could provide an important therapeutic option for these patients abtl is a firstinclass pikaktmtor signaling pathway inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors we are conducting cmc work in china required for filing the ind with cfda i’ll conclude my comments with some perspective on the china pharmaceuticals market this market continues to evolve and grow at an impressive rate it is increasingly being seen as receptive to both local innovative companies as well as multinational pharmaceutical companies and we have seen more large pharmaceutical companies expand their presence in china over the last couple of years through organic growth as well as through collaborations the national government and cfda are continuing to implement reforms designed to increase access and affordability of care access and affordability of care bring greater quality into the market and eliminate corruption speed the development and regulatory process relax barriers to entry encourage growth and creativity especially on the provincial level and encourage opportunities for crossborder partnerships as we have noted the key longterm national goal is to establish china as a biotechnology innovation powerhouse and ultimately to create a biopharmaceutical export business we continue to see capital investment by private and government players as well as support from academic centers which are vital to stimulating industry growth we also continue to see movement on the critical fronts of intellectual property protection and as we noted in our discussion of the oncology market with strong emphasis and eliminating poor quality and counterfeit products that can compromise public health we have noted before that poor quality local companies have voluntarily withdrawn regulatory applications knowing that the government is now taking punitive measures against unvalidated data and poor quality clinical work we expect the pace of reform to continue and over time the still slow regulatory process should accelerate further as we noted before there’s a strong sense throughout china that the government is advancing its reform agenda aggressively but is also moving carefully given the magnitude of the challenges hence the provinces are emerging as the laboratories of innovation this is evident not only in drop pricing schemes but involving our experimental programs for financing delivery and reimbursement within this changing environment we believe there are many opportunities for sciclone to continue to grow our marketed product portfolio and to advance our development pipeline of high quality differentiated medicines we have purposefully built our portfolio for inlicensing of best and pedigreed branded therapeutics to address core public health needs such as oncology and cardiovascular disease going forward positioning sciclone as a strong local pharmaceutical company will be key to leveraging our established presence and reputation in china to drive our longterm growth and value creation strategy we believe that by diversifying our pipeline with inlicensed western products with significant revenue potential as well as locally sourced innovative products and securing rights not only for china but also in growing pharma markets in taiwan south korea and vietnam we can grow our business organically at the same time we are exploring innovative business opportunities not just limited to china through licensing or acquisition which could enable us to potentially play a unique role in bridging the divide between china and the west as we approach the midyear mark for  we are confident that our core strategies to grow our commercial business advance and expand our development portfolio through creative partnering maintain high levels of fiscal responsibility and strong compliance are on track we believe we are well positioned to continue to build our reputation and standing as a key player in the china pharma market now i will ask hong to provide some additional color on our directtopatient marketing initiatives hong hong zhao thank you friedhelm as friedhelm noted our ecommerce pilot program with the sinopharm and the bai yang are progressing those programs represent important initial steps in implementing ways to reach patients more directly increase access to zadaxin and to build sales these programs are just the first step however an ownership of the data collected through this interactive platform becomes increasingly important so we are changing our approach to get fast and more complete access to date regarding our products and our patients this will allow us to directly customize and direct our programs according to our commercial strategies our core focus is to build zadaxin brand and the expanding access for patients physicians and the retail pharmacies this will be certainly over time build the retail channel into a truly alternative to the official tender loads and to correspondingly reduce our dependency on government tenders our internal nim for this expanding program is going to go to phase  we believe the timing is exactly right for the innovative approach as the growth of the disposable income continues and more people and china are covered by government insurance and the private insurance people are increasing seeking the high quality innovative health care products and services through the alternative channels our goal is to take advantage of this market changes by strengthening and managing our overall customer relationships one strategy already underway is to expanding our academic educational outreach and the sponsorship of the clinical trials other strategy underway are to improve the delivery of our messaging about our products develop more advanced online and mobile communication tools and to build large patient physician pharmacy database to support our market outreach strategies already in  we have made a significant program in defending our go to patient  program we have developed a goal set of the promotional materials and we have institute intensive sales force education and the training sections over the coming months we plan to implement specific components of the program for pharmacy outreach building our own sales channels and tight our physician patient and the pharmacy online programs we also plan to build out our data management systems we are excited about the potential of the go to patient  program to continue zadaxin’s strong growth and we are pleased with our progress to date back to you friedhelm friedhelm blobel thank you hong now i would like to ask wilson to discuss our financial performance for the first quarter  wilson wilson cheung thanks friedhelm now i will review our first quarter  financial results please consult the press release we issued today for additional details revenues in the first quarter of  were   million a  million or  increase compared to  million for the same period in  zadaxin revenues were  million in the first quarter of  a  million or  increase compared to  million for the same period in  of the  million in zadaxin revenues  million was attributed to revenues from sales generated in the fourth quarter of  that were above the referenced tender price and that were recognized in the first quarter of  this  million of revenue is a result of fourth quarter sales that were above the referenced tender price under provision in the agreement with our china distributor to share in part and the burden of price reductions promotion services revenues were  million for the first quarter of  a  million or  increase compared to  million for the same period in  on a gaap basis we reported net income in the first quarter of  of  million or  and  per share on a basic and diluted basis respectively compared to net income of approximately  million or  and  per share on a basic and diluted basis respectively for the same period in  our nongaap net income in the first quarter of  was  million or  and  per share on a basic and diluted basis respectively compared with nongaap net income of  million or  and  per share on a basic and diluted basis respectively for the same period in the prior year both gaap and nongaap net income were favorably impacted by the  million additional revenue recognition for zadaxin fourth quarter sales and the  million chinese government subsidy in the first quarter of  for the first quarter of  sales and marketing expenses were  million compared with  million for the same period in  the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  related to increases in salaries and benefits mainly from annual increases and to increased sales commissions based on increased zadaxin sales for the first quarter of  research and development expenses were  million compared with  million of rd expenses for the same period of  rd expenses were higher for the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  related to rd activities in china that relate to development expenses of product candidates inlicensed from certain business partners for the first quarter of  general and administrative expenses were  million compared with  million for the same period in  ga expenses were lower for the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  due to a foreign currency gain of  on remeasuring operational monetary assets partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits mainly from annual increases for the first quarter of  other income net was  million compared with  million for the same period in  other income net was higher principally for the first quarter of  compared to the first of  as a result of  million government subsidy related to our china operations which had no future performance obligations and was recognized upon receipt as other income for the first quarter of  income tax provision was approximately  million compared with  million for the same period in  the onetime  million income tax provision for the first quarter of  included  million in additional tax expense representing the correction of an error related to a previously unrecognized liability for an uncertain tax provision in china as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled  million compared to  million as of december   consistent with past practices we have presented nongaap information as we believe this nongaap information is useful for investors taken in conjunction with our gaap financial statements because we use such information internally for our operating budgeting and financial planning purposes nongaap information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of our operating results as reported under gaap the nongaap calculations and reconciliation are provided in the accompanying table in today’s press release titled reconciliation of gaap to nongaap net income relative to our outlook for  recognizing that we are still early in the year and in view of several positive nonrecurring events in q adding to our financial results for this quarter we are reconfirming our current guidance of projecting  revenue to be in the range between  million and  million driven by zadaxin revenues and our nongaap diluted earnings per share to be in the range of between  and  our outlook for  continues to be influenced by several factors including the overall growth rate of the china pharmaceuticals market anticipated pressure on pricing at the provincial level as well as on volume from reimbursement once new prdl rules are promulgated and implemented the effects of foreign exchange and higher rd expenses as we continue to advance our pipeline products towards commercialization because of anticipated impact in  of announced decreases in price under certain provincial tenders we expect that any benefit to our revenue from sales in prior quarters above the reference price will decline quarteroverquarter during  and that there might be no such future benefit in the third or fourth quarters nonetheless it will be offset at least in part through continued volume increases with that i will now turn the call back over to friedhelm friedhelm blobel thank you wilson now i would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from gabrielle zhou with maxim group gabrielle zhou hi good afternoon guys thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a solid quarter i know you guys provided full year guidance on revenues mainly driven by zadaxin sales can you give us some color on how much percentage of the revenue will be coming from the dc bead and also your estimates on the operating expenses for the full year wilson cheung hi gabrielle it’s wilson here we have almost no revenue last year in  for dc bead however we are anticipating some revenues to be generated in the second quarter the order will be coming in from sinopharm so we do expect some but it’s not going to be at a magnitude that is material as friedhelm has mentioned in his prepared comments that the time – it’s going to take a little bit longer given the time for teaching or training the health care professionals so it’s still going to be less than  million gabrielle zhou got it yes thanks for the clarity on it so let me shift gears to the business development part so should we be expecting new product inlicensed later this year and i know you are planning to file the nda for angiomax under the new cfda regulations so should we anticipate a product launch as early as the beginning of next year friedhelm blobel yes as far as the year is concerned we certainly have all those discussions going with western companies with chinese companies and we will – once we get to really agreement we will announce that but we need to wait to that part there’s discussion somehow and are certainly not a good indicator when we might be able to close additional deals the second question regarding angiomax you are correct that we are close to filing the nda and the nda process seems to have also be going a little bit faster so it’s not necessarily a full year any longer so we think that we could expect approval from the cfda if we are lucky late  more likely in early  and then start marketing and selling during the whole process of market access in  gabrielle zhou got it great thank you congratulations again friedhelm blobel thank you operator our next question comes from yi chen with rodman  renshaw your line is open you may ask your question unidentified analyst hi there this is mitchell on for yi sorry about that i have a couple of questions for you my first question is do you expect the zadaxin growth to come primarily from tier  or tier  and  cities going forward friedhelm blobel i mean the growth will come from both but there’s probably more growth from the tier  cities than from tier  cities but we see growth everywhere unidentified analyst okay great thank you and my next question is do you expect to see higher growth in liver disease or liver cancer revenues going forward or even if you see growth greater in other areas could you just comment on that friedhelm blobel well liver disease generally has been the key for zadaxin and we expect it to remain the key there are a number of studies going some with our support others just driven by hospitals which look at the use not only sepsis which we are driving but also lymphoma and some work in nonsmall cell lung cancer so these other possibilities or the use of thymalfasin and zadaxin and these other indications is certainly happening in certain places and probably will increase in the coming months and years unidentified analyst okay great thank you for providing color on that i appreciate it friedhelm blobel sure operator operator instructions i’m not showing any further question at this time i’d like to turn the call back over to dr blobel for closing comments
