continue to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock the sponsors may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions your percentage ownership in the

action or vote of our stockholders to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock including shares issuable upon the exercise of options or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and in the case of issuances of preferred stock would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock after this offering by our current stockholders and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall         as of december   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding of our issued and outstanding

certain exceptions and automatic extensions in certain circumstances such lockup agreements cover in the aggregate  shares of our common stock and vested options to purchase an additional  shares of

of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future the shares sold in this offering as well as our prior public offerings are eligible for immediate sale in the public market without restriction by persons other than our affiliates         under the amended and restated registration rights agreement with the sponsors and certain other shareholders beginning  days after this offering or such earlier time as we consent the sponsors may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws subject to

incorporated by reference herein and therein and any related free writing prospectus contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance in many cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as aim anticipate assume believe can have continue could due estimate expect forecast goal intend likely may objective outlook plan potential positioned predict pro forma project should target will would or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these forwardlooking statements are made based on our managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control these uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements         although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements are set forth under risk factors in our most recent annual report on form k incorporated by reference in this prospectus these forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date each forwardlooking statement is made we undertake no obligation except as may be required by law to publicly update or revise any of the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise         some of the important factors that could cause our actual results performance or financial condition to differ materially from expectations are  risks related to the effect of economic uncertainty  our substantial outstanding indebtedness of  billion could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our  billion variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our notes and credit facilities  restrictions in our debt agreements that limit our flexibility in operating our business as our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions and require that we maintain specified financial ratios upon the occurrence of certain events  changes in customer demand could materially adversely affect our sales results of operations and cash flow  our failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information which could result in additional data breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results  competition including internetbased competition could negatively impact our business  our reliance on foreign suppliers increases our risk of obtaining adequate timely and costeffective product supplies  our ability to open new stores and increase comparable store sales growth as our growth depends on our strategy of expanding out base of retail stores and if we are unable to continue this strategy our ability to increase our sales profitability and cash flow could be impaired s table of contents  damage to the reputation of the michaels brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales  a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our results of operations  unexpected or unfavorable consumer responses to our promotional and merchandising programs could materially adversely affect our sales results of operations cash flows and financial condition  our holding company structure makes us and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries dependent on the operations of our and their subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and  the sponsors have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and they may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders         the above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and it is not possible for us to predict all of them we derive many of our forwardlooking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts which are based upon many detailed assumptions while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations or cautionary statements are disclosed under risk factors and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our most recent annual report on form k and quarterly report on form q incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the risk

statements that are made from time to time in our other sec filings and public communications you should evaluate all forwardlooking statements made in this prospectus supplement the accompanying

purposes as discussed below         if an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds shares of our common stock the tax treatment of persons treated as its

current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles and will be subject to withholding as described in the next paragraph below if a distribution exceeds our current or accumulated earnings and profits the excess will be treated as a taxfree return of the nonus holders investment up to such holders adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain subject to the tax treatment described below in gain on sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock any distribution described in this paragraph would also be subject to the discussion below in additional withholding and information reporting requirements for shares of our common stock held by or through nonus entities         any dividends paid to a nonus holder with respect to shares of our common stock generally will be subject to a  us federal withholding tax unless such nonus holder provides the applicable withholding agent with an appropriate and validly completed irs form w including applicable attachments which may be required to be updated periodically prior to the payment of dividends such as  irs form wben or wbene as appropriate or successor form certifying under penalties of perjury that such nonus holder is entitled to a reduction in withholding under an applicable income tax treaty or  irs form weci or successor form certifying under penalties of perjury that a dividend paid on shares of our common stock is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states of the nonus holder in which case such dividend generally will be subject to regular graduated us federal income tax rates on a net income basis as described below         the certification requirement described above also may require a nonus holder that provides an irs form or that claims treaty benefits to provide its us taxpayer identification number special certification and other requirements apply in the case of certain nonus holders that are intermediaries or passthrough entities for us federal income tax purposes         each nonus holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the specific methods for satisfying these requirements a claim for exemption will not be valid if the person receiving the applicable form has actual knowledge or reason to know that the statements on the form are false s table of contents         if dividends are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states of the nonus holder and if required by an applicable income tax treaty are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such nonus holder in the united states the nonus holder although exempt from the withholding tax described above provided that the certifications described above are satisfied will generally be subject to us federal income tax on such dividends on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a resident of the united states in addition if such nonus holder is taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes such nonus holder may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to  of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year unless an applicable income tax treaty

federal income tax at a rate of  unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise on the amount by which such nonus holders capital gains allocable to us sources exceed capital losses allocable to us sources during the taxable year of the disposition         with respect to the second exception above although there can be no assurance we believe we are not and we do not currently anticipate becoming a usrphc however because the determination of whether we are a usrphc depends on the fair market value of our us real property relative to the fair market value of other business assets there can be no assurance that we are not currently or will not become a usrphc in the future generally a corporation is a usrphc only if the fair market value of its united states real property interests as defined in the code equals or exceeds  of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus certain other assets used or held for use in a trade or business even if we are or become a usrphc a nonus holder would not be subject to us federal income tax on a sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock by reason of our

other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock occurs and ii such nonus holder does not own and is not deemed to own directly indirectly or constructively more than  of our common stock at any time during the relevant period if we are a usrphc and the requirements of i or ii are not met gain on the disposition of shares of our common stock generally will be taxed in the same manner as gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business except that the branch profits tax will not apply prospective s table of contents investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are or were to become a usrphc         if the third exception applies the nonus holder generally will be subject to us federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to such gain in the same manner as if such holder were a resident of the united states unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty and a nonus

accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance in many cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as aim anticipate assume believe can have continue could due estimate expect forecast goal intend likely may objective outlook plan potential positioned predict pro forma project should target will would or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these forwardlooking statements are made based on our managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control these uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements         although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements are set forth under risk factors in our most recent annual report on form k incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in any subsequent quarterly report on form q and the risk factors section in the applicable prospectus supplement these forwardlooking statements are based on information available to us on the date each forwardlooking statement is made we undertake no obligation except as may be required by law to publicly update or revise any of the forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise         some of the important factors that could cause our actual results performance or financial condition to differ materially from expectations are  general economic factors and changes in consumer preference may adversely affect our performance and could materially adversely affect our sales results of operations and cash flow  our substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry expose us to interest rate risk prevent us from meeting our obligations under our notes and credit facilities and limit our flexibility in operating our business  a failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information which could result in additional company data breaches could materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results  competition including internetbased competition could negatively impact our business  our significant reliance on foreign suppliers particularly those located in china increases our risk of obtaining adequate timely and costeffective product supplies  even if we are able to substantially continue our strategy of expanding our store base our success will depend on how well we manage our business  damage to the reputations of the michaels brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect sales  our fourth quarter has historically been our highest quarter for sales and profitability and a weak fourth quarter could have material adverse impacts on us  table of contents  our promotional and merchandising programs are dependent on consumer responses which could be unfavorable or unexpected adversely impacting our sales  our holding company structure makes us and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries dependent on the operations of our and their subsidiaries to meet our and their financial obligations and  investment funds affiliated with or advised by bain capital partners llc and the blackstone group lp collectively together with their applicable affiliates the sponsors have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and they may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders         the above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and it is not possible for us to predict all of them we derive many of our forwardlooking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts which are based upon many detailed assumptions while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations or cautionary statements are disclosed under risk factors and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our most recent annual report on form k incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in any

forwardlooking statements made in this prospectus the accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein in the context of these risks and uncertainties         potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forwardlooking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the

otherwise  table of contents use of proceeds         we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders  table of contents description of capital stock         as of may   the total amount of our authorized common stock consisted of  shares of common stock par value  per share and we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding of which  shares were held by our sponsors and no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of may   we had  stockholders of record of common stock and had unvested restricted stock awards and outstanding options to purchase  shares of common stock         the discussion set forth below describes our capital stock certificate of incorporation and bylaws we urge you to read the full text of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part common stock         except as required by law or matters relating solely to the terms of preferred stock each outstanding share of common stock will be entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders holders of shares of our common stock shall have no cumulative voting rights         our shares of common stock are listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol mik preferred stock         our board of directors board may without further action by our stockholders from time to time direct the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and may at the time of issuance determine the designations powers preferences privileges and relative participating optional or special rights as well as the qualifications limitations or restrictions thereof including dividend rights conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption and liquidation preferences any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the common stock satisfaction of any dividend preferences of outstanding shares of preferred stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends on shares of our common stock holders of shares of preferred stock may be entitled to receive a preference payment in the event of our liquidation before any payment is made to the holders of shares of our common stock under specified circumstances the issuance of shares of preferred stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger tender offer or proxy contest the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities or the removal of incumbent management our board without stockholder approval may issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights which could adversely affect the holders of shares of our common stock and the market value of our common stock subject to the rights of the holders of shares of preferred stock the number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors voting together as a single class there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding and we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock although we may in the future decide to do so antitakeover effects of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws         our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may delay defer or discourage another party from acquiring control of us we expect that these provisions which are summarized below will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids these provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with the board which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in  table of contents favor of our stockholders however these provisions also give the board the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor authorized but unissued capital stock         the general corporation law of the state of delaware the dgcl does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares however the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market which would apply as long as our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market require stockholder approval of certain issuances equal to or exceeding  of the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding number of shares of common stock these additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes including future public offerings to raise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions         one of the effects of the existence of authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock may be to enable our board to issue shares to persons friendly to current management which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise and thereby protect the continuity of our management and possibly deprive the stockholder of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices board of directors         our certificate of incorporation provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws also provide that a director may be removed without cause as long as investment funds affiliated with our sponsors hold a majority of our outstanding common stock and when this ceases to be the case only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least  of our voting stock any vacancy on our board including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office action by written consent         the dgcl provides that unless otherwise stated in a corporations certificate of incorporation the stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting our certificate of incorporation provides that after the investment funds associated with the sponsors collectively own less than majority of our outstanding common stock any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders may be effected only at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by our stockholders as a result investments funds associated with the sponsors will be able to act by written consent so long as they collectively own at least a majority of our outstanding common stock special meeting of stockholders and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals         our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that except as otherwise required by law and subject to any rights of the holders of preferred stock special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by a our chairman or any vice chairman of the board b the board pursuant to a written resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors that our board would have if there were no vacancies or c our secretary at the request of  of our common stockholders as long as investment funds affiliated with the sponsors hold a majority of our common stock         in addition our bylaws require advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of the stockholders including the nomination of directors stockholders at an annual meeting may only consider the proposals specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board or by a stockholder of record on the record date for  table of contents the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting who has delivered a timely written notice in proper form to our secretary of the stockholders intention to bring such business before the meeting who attends or has a qualified representative attend the stockholder meeting and who has otherwise complied with the provisions of our bylaws and applicable law         these provisions could have the effect of delaying any stockholder actions until the next stockholder meeting even if they are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting stock amendment to certificate of incorporation and bylaws         the dgcl provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on amendments to a corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws is required to approve such amendment unless a corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws as the case may be requires a greater percentage our bylaws may be altered amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board or in addition to any other vote otherwise required by law the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock so long as investment funds affiliated with the sponsors collectively beneficially own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock and when this ceases to be the case a vote of at least  of our outstanding common stock will be required additionally so long as the investment funds affiliated with the sponsors collectively beneficially own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and from and after the date on which the investment funds affiliated with the sponsors cease collectively to beneficially own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock the affirmative vote of at least  of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock in each case entitled to vote on the adoption alteration amendment or repeal of our certificate of incorporation voting as a single class is required to amend or repeal or to adopt any provision inconsistent with the board of directors director liability action by written consent special meetings of stockholders amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws business combinations renouncement of corporate opportunity and exclusive jurisdiction of certain actions provisions described in our certificate of incorporation these provisions may have the effect of deferring delaying or discouraging the removal of any antitakeover defenses provided for in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws business combinations         we have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to section  of the dgcl an antitakeover law in general section  prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination such as a merger with a person or group owning  or more of the corporations voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless with certain exceptions the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner accordingly we are not subject to any antitakeover effects of section  however our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as section  except that they provide that our sponsors and their respective affiliates will not be deemed to be interested stockholders regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions renouncement of corporate opportunity         our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in or in being offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunity that may from time to time be presented to the sponsors or any of their respective officers directors agents stockholders members partners affiliates and subsidiaries other than us and our subsidiaries and that may be a business  table of contents opportunity for the sponsors even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so no such person will be liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty as a director or officer or otherwise by reason of the fact that such person acting in good faith pursues or acquires any such business opportunity directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity or information regarding any such business opportunity to us unless in the case of any such person who is our director or officer any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer none of the sponsors any of the investment funds associated with the sponsors or any of their respective representatives has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or any of our subsidiaries exclusive jurisdiction of certain actions         our certificate of incorporation requires to the fullest extent permitted by law that i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of the company to the company or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against the company arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim against the company governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the court of chancery in the state of delaware although we believe this provision benefits the company by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers limitations on liability and indemnification of officers and directors         our certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and provide that we will indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by such law we
