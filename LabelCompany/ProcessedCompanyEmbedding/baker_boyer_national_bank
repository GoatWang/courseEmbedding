customer reviews ›   m reviewed by mbrew dec   excellent service  in person and online our initial business with baker boyer bank was opening a mortgage account for a first time home purchase as we shopped for a mortgage we found baker boyers rates to be competitive in contrast to the loan center we had also contacted bayer boyers answers to our questions were clear and their practices and fees were understandable and consistent with what our research indicated as signs of a reliable lender moreover baker boyer bank indicated that they do not resell mortgages to another company  and this has been true of our home loan when we inquired about refinancing a few years later baker boyer offered the best interest rate available and charged minimal fees for the transaction since this time we have migrated most of our banking to baker boyer bank and have been very happy with their service their online service is and modern and full featured features include  records available for a long time eg every transaction for our mortgage account is visible since the refinance over  months ago  viewable images of cashed checks front and back  electronic download of records to quicken ms money etc  a mobile device app exists  electronic billpay free the only area where i find this bank limiting at times is that they are a localregional bank and they have a limited number of atms thank you for your feedback is this review helpful yes  no    s reviewed by stephanie jun   unethical and irresponsible mortgage department this is baker boyers mission statement and yet nothing could be further from the truth you are the most important part of our day we strive to build a relationship that leads to your financial success were always with youã¢ï¿½ï¿½whether your goal is to package your financial obligations in a way that allows you to plan for the future or your focus is on your childs educationã¢ï¿½ï¿½were here to help we listen we find solutions you are the focus of everything we do my families experience with the home loan department has been a catastrophe this bank has acted unethically and potentially illegally to the extent freddie mac the largest mortgage lender in the us is now investigating their home loan practices and specifically their mortgage department consequently i encourage you to look elsewhere for your home loan needs contrary to their statement were here to help they are not should you run into trouble as in our case i developed stage  cancer and missed a payment they were not there as they claim on the contrary they quickly initiated foreclosure and throughout the  month process routinely lied to us as we struggled to get current and retain our home they neither listened nor did they attempt to find solutions despite repeated attempts by government agencies and lawyers to intervene on our behalf the solutions that we proposed fell on deaf ears i once again would recommend that you choose a bank that you can trust do your research ask the right questions sadly we bought into their above mission statement and now we are paying the price thank you for your feedback is this review helpful yes  no  see all
