placement peak season staffing solutions for the most wonderful time of the year by brian bartolotta once again we find ourselves in a complicated “peak season” for logistics professionals while the chinese markets falter air cargo traffic shows declines leading up to the  holiday season but maritime shipping is still strong as west coast ports alleviated their congestion the air cargo market is expected to fully recover and increase especially if the chinese yuan declines as this will make cargo coming from china cheaper and more attractive during the holidays considering these factors the need for extra help is a real and vital part of planning for the fourth quarter peak season brings a set of challenges to logistics companies including the need for extra help and the need to have that extra help be as skilled as possible an increase in demand and the urgency of a short season compel us to have a strong workforce behind us bcs understands the need for finding the right people to have with you during this massive uptick in trade we have access to a wealth of experienced knowledgeable and skilled support staff who are ready to step in and apply their expertise to any shipping solution available we at bcs work with a dynamic array of logistics companies who are eager to take on new help for both this peak season and beyond understandably logistics is a broad and

the best positions but the right positions considering variable skill sets job descriptions personality and corporate culture peak season can turn into a frenzy this time of year and we’re here

president bcs placements llc registered broker dealer keithbutlerbcsplacementscom  market opportunity after a decade of rental apartment values being coupled with condominium values apartment values separated and traveled up  in  while condo and singlefamily values declined two percent   this divergence at the beginning the new decade signaled that rental apartments were reestablishing their identity as distinct investments  in the wake of the damage left by overindulging on homeownership an appreciation is emerging for valuecreation that emphasizes apartments as wellmanaged and maintained rental communities that can deliver services and comforts that many people with workforce incomes are unable to afford in a home purchase   this reassertion of the important role of apartments is timely for crossbeam we significantly increased our capabilities in  through our merger with concierge asset management in december the merger will allow us to finance redevelop and manage apartments using our integrated operating platform our valueadd strategy targets the largest segment of marketrate renters those with workforce incomes when renting began its surge from  to  homeownership was housing’s only growth engine homeownership rates climbed an average of  basis points per year the number who left renting to become homeowners overwhelmed new renter household formations  from  through  the renter household population actually shrunk by   that all changed in  when the first wave of carelessly underwritten mortgages canaries in the mind shaft of the looming crisis began to default the second half of the decade was a mirror image of the first the census’ housing vacancy survey showed the renter population growing from  million at the end  to  at the end of  after negative growth in the first five years  million new renter households formed in the second five years in  renter household formations grew by  the first two quarters of  have seen blistering growth with about  new rental households for in the first two quarters  by june   the homeownership rate dropped  basis points to  since its peak in q  and  basis points since q  new renter household formations per quarter averaged  from  through  since  began new renter household formations have averaged  per quarter and  per quarter in  in  quarters since the beginning of  about  million new renter households have formed  for crossbeam as an apartment investor developer redeveloper and lessor this decade promises to be one of substantial opportunity former homeowners become new renters in the six years from  through  the number of american households grew by about  million from about  million to about  million  during those same six years the number of new renter households grew by  million reflecting an important change in the demographics of renters more than ever before a large number of new renter households are being formed by former homeowners  likely these people were overchallenged by their mortgages and forced into renting  since those with workforce incomes are on the lower end of qualifying for homeownership it’s likely that many of these new refugees from homeownership fit crossbeam’s target market more mature and selective it’s also likely these former homeowners will be drawn to professionally managed rental apartment communities  because of their credit histories they are unlikely to be able to depart from renting to purchase a house anytime soon suggesting that apartment managers who meet the needs of this group will experience lower turnover rates where homeownershiprentership will find stability the word “homeownership” long has been a staple in our housing lexicon  until recently the word “rentership” was hardly heard from quietly defined by its betterknown reciprocal homeownership has long defined the american dream  rentership and homeownership are counterweights in an equation that always adds to  demographers assume that all households are doing one or the other either renting or owing  not only has  quarters of strong growth in new renter households given currency to word rentership but also several seemingly indelible american trends suggests that rentership will continue to grow at what percentages will the equation between homeownership and rentership stabilize  we believe there are two credible forecasts on the equation’s equilibrium over the course of this decade  most forecasters agree that rentership will continue to gain  the conservative forecasters argue that laws of average will propel the equation back to  to  its average from  to  the decade before overactive home lending began to stimulate the homeownership’s extraordinary move the rate had been relatively stable in the low ’s since record keeping began in   a growing number of forecasters argue that there has been a paradigm shift since the late th century for them the belief that rates will stabilize at  is wistfulness for a bygone era  the housing bubble they argue wrecked the creditworthiness of millions of homeowners forcing them into renting and wiping out their ability to qualify as homebuyers anytime soon  further the conditions that once allowed the homeownership rate to stabilize at  have been changed by the negative affects of globalization on middle class wage growth the codification of tighter home lending standards in dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and by demographic changes such as the declining marriage rate and the growth in the percentage minority populations with greater propensity to rent   also looming are proposed changes in government’s role as a guarantor of home mortgage debt large portions of the american middle class especially those with workforce incomes have found banks more willing to lend because of the backstop provided by fannie mae or freddie mac  if the obama administrations proposals to wind down those agencies succeed homeownership for the american middle class will become less accessible  we have used a  homeownership rate as a proxy forecast for this school though many project rates that are lower   new renter household formations occupancy rates are forecasted we have projected overall apartment market occupancy rates based on forecast of two different stabilized homeownership rates  and  achieved over the course of the decade from   the homeownership rate has dropped an average of  basis points per year for the last  ½ years through june   if decline continues apace homeownership will breach  by the end of  and  by the end of q  to smooth our projections to the end of the decade we have assumed the rate drops  basis points annually to  by the end of  and  basis points annually to  by the end of   if household formations are assumed to grow at  million per year then new renter households from  to  will form at  annually under the  homeownership forecast and  annually under the  homeownership forecast  assuming the number of newly constructed rental units not including condos averages  going forward the average for the last  years that the number of units demolished due to obsolescence averages  per year in line with a harvard joint center for housing studies forecast and that the inventory of vacant rental units on december   was  million as reported by the census america’s overall apartment occupancy rate will reach  in the years as shown below demand for new developments these forecast suggests that there will be significant opportunity for new development if the homeownership rate drops  basis points per year less than half its average for the last  ½ years america’s rental housing will be  occupied by the end of  if the homeownership rate falls  basis points per year then america’s rental housing will be  occupied by before the end of  there is always the risk that excess supplies of singlefamily housing will be brought into the market adding risk to new purposebuilt multifamily rentals strategies especially when the singlefamily market is overbuilt as in the late ’s harvard labels this “tenure switching” or the act of using a singlefamily house as rentals until a buyer can be found    the chart below shows that from  to  about  million detached singlefamily units were put up for rent  while this tenureswitched supply gets picked up by the census’ vacancy survey private surveyors of the multifamily vacancy rates do not include this inventory in their surveys of vacancy rates for professionally managed apartments  the advantages scale and professional management according to the harvard joint center for housing studies  of america’s rental housing units are individually owned and that more than half of all rentals are in small structures including singlefamily homes to unit buildings and manufactured homes often poorly capitalized many individual owners perform their units’ administrative and maintenance functions  about  of the individuallyowned units were acquired by as the owners residences only  of these owners reported making a profit the preceding year according to harvard’s survey   this describes much of the singlefamily inventory that finds its way into the rental market  while this inventory competes with crossbeam in theory it offers little practical competition our competitors are other marketrate professionallymanaged rental apartment communities a minority of the rental stock which form a operate in a tier that is distinct from individually owned operated apartments  the market perceives this distinction which is best shown in the twotiered vacancy rates in the chart below a deeper look at the rentership’s growth for those who want to take a deeper look at our rentership projections we are providing the sections below the rentership arguments made by economists demographers and students of government policy changes we begin with the arguments of the economist at once the most readily quantifiable and the arguments that suggest the largest growth in rentership fallout from a decade of excess economists forecast rentership ironically it’s america’s prior exuberance for homeownership that may propagate the most new renters this decade new york federal reserve economists andrew haughwout richard peach and joseph tracy began a school of critical thinking on this subject that has since been picked up by economists and goldman sachs and morgan stanley in a seminal  paper the fed economist argued that mortgagees with negative equity loans were likely to end up as renters  not all of them will but many of them will  the fed economists argued that q ’s homeownership rate was effectively closer to   basis points below what had been reported by the census at that time a similar perspective on the homeownership rate was given by the goldman sachs us economic team in a note published april     “although the outlook for the homeownership rate is quite uncertain we believe that a continued decline remains the most likely outcome for one thing the homeownership rate remains substantially above its prehousing bubble level” which averaged about  from  to  another factor is that  “much of the mortgage finance infrastructure that sparked that increase has yet to return it is difficult for many prospective homebuyers to find equally attractive terms today “ “our forecast is consistent with research by the federal reserve bank of new york “ continued goldman “many current homeowners will likely convert into renters over time so subtracting negative equity households out of the homeownership rate may provide guidance on where the official rate is likely to head over time as of the end of  this exercise implied an effective homeownership rate excluding negative equity households of  the actual rate is likely to move toward the effective rate in the future” even more recently morgan stanley borrowed from the fed economists’ analytical approach to forecasting the homeownership rate  in a july   report morgan stanley’s oliver chang wrote that america is moving toward a “rentership society”    chang focused on mortgage delinquencies rather than negative equity though the two may substantially overlap he noted that if the bulge of  million delinquent borrowers were removed from the homeownership rolls the homeownership rate would drop to  placing the rentership rate at  easily its highest level ever  httpwwwbloombergcomnewsusmovestorentershipsocietyasowningtumblesmorganstanleysayshtml demography america’s demography does offer less support for homeownership today than in the era from  to  singles predispose toward renting by about  points over married couples  to  similarly minorities predispose toward renting by about  points over whites  to  both of these renter populations are growing as a percentage of the american whole  marriage rates were down to about  of us households in  having dropped from about  in   httpwwwnytimescomusmarryhtmlrefcensus the larger body of singles today when measured against their tendency to be renters adds  basis points the percentage of rentership when compared to ’s marriage rates in theory the  rentershiphomeownership rates of  would project to  to account for the new marriage demographic the other influential demographic change is the growth of the minority population as a percent of the american whole according to the  us census of  million people added to the us population between  and  only  million were nonhispanic whites representing  of total growth  this is a significant change from the ’s when nonhispanic whites represented  of the growth  with their  point higher propensity to rent an increasing minority population will propel the need for more rental units httpwwwbrookingseduopinionscensusdemographicsfreyaspx pew research measured at the affect of these growth rates on the ethnic makeup of the country  pew concluded that the millennial generation from ages  was  white and  minority  in contrast the population of adults above  years old is  white and  minority  as they form households this larger percentage of millennial minorities will lower the homeownership rate and raise the rentership rate by  basis points if they continue to favor renting at the same rate above whites that would move change the  rentershiphomeownership ratios to   government policy begins to emphasize middle class renting still in its early stages is a wellreceived report “reforming america’s housing finance” was submitted in february  to congress by the department of treasury and the department of housing and urban affairs httpwwwtreasurygovinitiativesdocumentsreformingamericashousingfinancemarketpdf reeling from the  billion spent honoring fannie mae’s and freddie mac’s guarantees with more to come the obama administration’s report concludes that fannie and freddie are no longer affordable it is a momentous shift that is likely to affect american’s access to government guaranteed home mortgage credit   on february  the new york times characterized the report as an “audacious call for the federal government to cut back its broadly popular longrunning campaign to help americans own homes” the story went on to say that administration officials “concluded the country could no longer afford to sustain its commitment to minting homeowners better to help some people rent” httpwwwnytimescombusinesshousinghtmlremceta these proposed policy changes taken together with the economist calculations of defaulted overburdened borrowers and the demographers observations of the impact of cultural and ethnic changes in the american population suggest significant longterm trends according to the new york times  “federal programs subsidized nine in  mortgage loans made last year if the obama administration succeeds that could plummet to a mere onein loans by the end of the decade “ reported the times “investors also may be reluctant to provide money for year fixed mortgages a product that has never existed without government support “ america’s rental housing supply according to the biennial  “america’s rental housing” study released in april  by harvard university’s joint center for housing studies there are  apartment units demolished each year and an average of only  purposebuilt multifamily replacement units constructed only about half the newly constructed units are aimed at the market that crossbeam targets “marketrate rentals accounted for little more than half of the  new multifamily units completed each year from  through  of the remainder  percent were assisted rentals produced through the low income housing tax credit program and the other  percent were intended for sale as condominiums”  an accelerant to the loss of rental units is the age of the rental stock  “as of  the median rentalhousing unit was  years old by  the median age stood at  years” writes harvard purposebuilt condominiums have averaged  units over the last  years  subtract those from the  and annual demolitions exceed average annual purposebuilt multifamily units by   in a market that’s been inundated with almost  million new renter households from  through  where have all the needed rental units come from  the answer says harvard is the singlefamily housing market “the pace of net conversions from owner to renter tripled in  relative to  then nearly doubled again in  to  million units singlefamily detached homes were the driving force accounting for three out of every four conversions to rentals between  and  httpwwwjchsharvardedupublicationsrentalrhamericasrentalhousingamericasrentalhousingpdf fragmented competition is a competitive advantage for crossbeam the marketrate professionallymanaged apartment communities that crossbeam develops or redevelops are the minority of the rental stock harvard point out that    of rental units are individually owned  further “more than half of all rentals are in small structures including singlefamily homes to unit buildings and manufactured homes” observes harvard  these individuals often perform administrative and maintenance functions themselves  about  of these individuallyowned units were originally acquired by these owners as residences according to a  survey referenced in the harvard report the latest data available  only  of these owners reported making a profit the preceding year  “with a significant share of the individual owners under financial pressure“ writes harvard “it is no surprise that  of those owning singfamily detached rentals reported some degree of deferred maintenance as did  of those owning properties with  units”   keithbutlerbcsplacementscom   posted by keith butler at  pm no comments email
