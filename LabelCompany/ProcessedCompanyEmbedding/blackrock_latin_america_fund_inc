so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions international investing involves special risks including but not limited to currency fluctuations illiquidity and volatility these risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets fixed income risks include interestrate and credit risk typically when interest rates rise there is a corresponding decline in bond values credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns in addition many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity nondiversification of investments means that more assets are potentially invested in fewer securities than if investments were diversified so risk is increased because each investment has a greater effect on performance the fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility shortselling entails special risks if the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value the fund will lose value any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing shortsale proceeds in other investments the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this fivepillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research and the weighting of each pillar may vary the analyst rating ultimately reflects the analyst’s overall assessment and is overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a bronzerated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating analyst ratings are reevaluated at least every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please click here the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstars current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstars expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost all returns assume reinvestment of all dividends performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included performance

cited and on the funds nav at the end of the period some blackrock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end those distributions temporarily cause
