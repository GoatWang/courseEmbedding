special opportunity fund i lp sessa capital lp ashford prime responds to lawsuit from sessa capital ashford prime responds to lawsuit from sessa capital feb 0  0 et from ashford hospitality prime inc dallas feb   prnewswire  ashford hospitality prime inc nyse ahp ashford prime or the company has been informed today of a lawsuit filed by sessa capital sessa against the company and its directors the company disputes the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit the company issued the following statement in response we believe this lawsuit is without merit and yet another distracting tactic by one shareholder to prioritize its own shortterm interests sessa launched its campaign after the company had already announced a strategic review process focused on determining the best path to maximize shareholder value in contrast we believe based on our limited interactions that sessa is only interested in seeking an immediate sale of the company regardless of whether it is in the best interest of all shareholders or is the best longterm solution the company and its board have been and remain fully committed to maximizing longterm shareholder value as previously announced the company is currently conducting a thorough strategic review process which may include a sale sessa should let the board perform its fiduciary duty rather than wasting time and resources on meritless claims   ashford prime would also like to correct some of the most egregious misrepresentations in this complaint the magnitude of the termination fee that sessa is complaining about remains unchanged since the time of ashford primes spinoff from ashford hospitality trust affording all shareholders ownership in the advisor – the potential recipient of the termination fee sessa has long been aware of the terms of the companys advisory agreement and was fully aware of the termination fees existence after it was already in place sessa increased its investment in the company after the company enacted the amendments to the advisory agreement that it is now criticizing further sessa has never meaningfully engaged with the company  the company on numerous occasions offered sessa opportunities to discuss its questions and ideas however it is our belief based on our limited interactions with sessa that since day one sessa has planned to pursue a disruptive proxy contest and litigation to pressure the company into a quick sale ashford hospitality prime is a real estate investment trust reit focused on investing in luxury hotels located in resort and gateway

capital announcing receptivity to a settlement still stands news provided by ashford hospitality prime inc may    et share this article dallas may   prnewswire  ashford hospitality prime inc nyse ahp ashford prime or the company today announced that it sent an open letter to sessa capital sessa stating that the companys receptivity to settlement discussions still stands  the full text of the letter follows dear mr petry we have read your response to our open letter regarding a settlement in which you rejected the terms of our settlement proposal in favor of seeing the proxy contest to completion  although judge david godbey agreed with our determination that your proposed nominees are invalid and ineligible to stand for election at the companys  annual meeting we nevertheless believe that it is in the best interest of all ashford prime stockholders that we put an end once and for all to the expensive and disparaging proxy contest and litigation that has engulfed the company since you filed your lawsuits against the company and announced your board slate in january  to this end we are writing to inform you that our previous offer to settle still stands so that the company may refocus its full efforts to maximize value for all shareholders as a reminder the key elements of our proposal are as follows board composition we have previously announced a plan to expand the board by two adding new independent directors with relevant hospitality industry experience this would bring our total director count to nine seven of whom would be independent we would agree to involve sessa in the selection of these two new directors special committee for advisor transactions the board of directors would form this new standing committee comprised only of independent directors including at least one of the newlyadded directors all transactions with our advisor would be subject to this committees prior approval the committee would be tasked with and empowered to improve the terms of the advisory agreement settlement of litigation and standstill the parties would immediately end their litigation and sessa would agree to a customary standstill that would provide the newly comprised board time to implement its business strategy without further distracting and expensive proxy contests brought by sessa capital we continue to believe that implementation of this proposed settlement would further enhance the benefits that we expect to be realized in connection with the companys recentlyannounced strategic plan  the company has already made substantial progress in this regard including the execution of a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the courtyard seattle downtown hotel for  million subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement which represents a purchase price of  per key and a trailing  month cap rate of  on net operating income the repurchase of  million of our common stock representing approximately 0 shares at an average price of  per share as of may   and the withdrawal of the companys capital from the investment fund the proceeds of which are targeted for the companys stock repurchase program we will continue to execute on these strategic review initiatives and others and believe that the best is yet to come it is our sincere hope that you will join us in pursuing a path going forward based on constructive dialogue and cooperation  we remain willing to move quickly to formalize the proposal outlined above  youre welcome to contact us privately or publicly as to your answer regardless of your choice rest assured that we will continue to work tirelessly to create value for all ashford prime stockholders including sessa sincerely curtis b mcwilliams lead independent director  stefani d
