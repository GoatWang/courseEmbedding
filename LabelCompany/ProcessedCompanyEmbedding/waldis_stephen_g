ill come back a bit later to provide some further details regarding our financials and forwardlooking outlook steve stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer great thanks karen and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results which met or exceeded the high end of our expectations on both the top line and bottom line our nongaap revenues in the quarter were  million which represented  yearoveryear growth and was at the high end of our guidance range from a profitability perspective we generated  nongaap operating margin and a nongaap eps of  synchronosss strong revenue growth and profitability in the fourth quarter was highlighted by a  yearoveryear growth in our cloud service business a key contributor to this performance was the continued success of our verizon relationship and further evidenced by our new enterprise venture just announced today in identity management and our synchronoss universal id product which ill provide more detail on in just a few minutes during the quarter we made great progress advancing our cloud initiatives and also migrating many of our fsecure clients to the synchronoss personal cloud platform at sfr singtel america movil british telecom migration process is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of this year we believe this will provide a solid foundation for longterm growth and at att we successfully deployed the initial version of our personal cloud offering in late  and remain on track to deploy additional versions with deeper integration and more features throughout  as a result we believe we remain well positioned to exit  with a strong run rate on adoption following a similar pattern and rollout as our initial launch of the personal cloud offering at verizon regards to our progress at tmobile we continued to successfully deploy our synchronoss mobile content transfer offering in the fourth quarter which we believe will open an opportunity to potentially expand into personal cloud adoption in  now let me turn to our activation business although we saw a new and solid expansion deal activity in our activation business this was offset by lower than expected transaction volumes during the quarter this was due primarily to certain international deployments that were expected to drive more meaningful activation volumes but they did not move into production during the fourth quarter as we have previously anticipated now since becoming a public company weve discussed the fact that the timing of activation deployments is driven by the internal process at the carrier which can sometimes shift the timetable to ramp transaction flows by months and sometimes quarters once the new activation programs do finally go into production the visibility and timing of expected transaction volumes can become much more predictable now were pleased with our ability to further expand our enterprise channel with a new win at att by adding incremental transaction type supporting our enterprise broadband business and during the fourth quarter we also won a new wireless activation channel at atts iusacell property in mexico and finally during the quarter we announced we signed a new multiyear contract with att that extends the current contract on all existing activation channels through  the final noteworthy item to mention related to our activation business is were excited to have won a new deal during the fourth quarter to manage all the indirect broadband activations from amazoncom in north america in regards to progress with our integrated life platform which provides activation capabilities for nontraditional devices such as connected cars and wearables we recently announced a new partnership with general motors onstar to expand activation into merchant services for onstar atyourservice and as weve closed out one year and are at the beginning of another we are continuing to execute our plans to take the company in over  billion in revenue and in  we made great progress achieving this goal specifically we grew our total revenues  to approximately  million and achieved nongaap operating margins of  both of which exceeded the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year we reported cloud revenues of  million up  yearoveryear and well above our original expectations driven by the expansion of our customer base and our ability to get into new markets and we grew our activation business by  to  million which was a solid performance considering the later than expected closing and ramp process related to some international opportunities that i just mentioned a moment ago and weve also made great progress in our cloud virtualization strategy dramatically decreasing our capital expenditures resulting in generating free cash flow of over  million in  on a nongaap basis up from approximately breakeven a year earlier and finally we announced the establishment of our enterprise business unit including our strategic venture with goldman sachs and during the fourth quarter our enterprise efforts were off to a good start as we successfully closed the goldman transaction and established and centralized our working teams the process of commercializing the software and the integration with workspace continued which we expect to be ready at the end of the second quarter of this year we also completed the certification of our secure mobility suite and our partnership with samsung knox platform which was announced during samsungs keynote address at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas with goldman sachs furthermore today were announcing the establishment of a new strategic venture with verizon that we believe will accelerate our move into the enterprise even further by adding multifactor authentication and identity management capabilities and complements our secure mobility suite as part of the initial launch into enterprise in  we stated how important this effort can be to our longterm success by not only growing and diversifying new customers and markets but also forming even more strategic relationships with our core communication service providers now to provide a bit of a background synchronoss has been engaging and working with verizon on our enterprise initiatives during  and had a series of strategic discussions in which we believe multifactor authentication and identity management combined with our secure mobility suite can make a very powerful value prop in the market given our strong proven track record at verizon including scaling our personal cloud platform this created an opportunity to further strengthen our partnership in discussions this past summer we began to plan discuss and actively work with verizon in providing a new and advanced solution to the market to move forward and significantly enhance an initial version that was being rolled out to a select small group of marquee enterprise accounts we believe our synchronoss universal id platform is a very powerful and complementary solution to our secure mobility suite and its a logical extension to the multifactor authentication which allows users to access information online without a need for usernames or passwords our plan is to release an enhanced version of this solution in late second half of  which will be fully commercialized version in the market we have posted a link on our website to a demo that can clearly show the power of this new solution called the synchronoss universal id as part of our venture agreement verizon has agreed to deploy the enhanced solution across its employee base and work with synchronoss in the coming years to deploy across their consumer subscriber base getting the ability to essentially touch almost a third of the us consumer market offers us a great way to secure and scale with high visibility into the online consumer market for multifactor authentication and clearly jumpstarts our goal of expanding our secure mobility suite and our enterprise efforts in general from a gotomarket perspective verizon and synchronoss will work together to sell universal id solution and enterprise accounts as part of the venture agreement verizon will be supporting synchronoss if we take over and manage a select group of marquee enterprise accounts from verizon that have participated in an early version and have expressed interest in the new enhanced multifactor authentication solution we continue to believe the focused expansion into the enterprise space opens incremental multibillion dollar opportunity for synchronoss we expect the formation of the enterprise business unit board of advisors which now includes executives from goldman sachs verizon vodafone and morgan stanley help us scale our enterprise initiatives as we move forward as we start  i feel we have the strongest market position and widest breadth of new products and opportunities in the history of the company the confidence that we have in our growth initiatives is evidenced by the level of investments that we plan on making in our business in  including our accelerated investments in our enterprise business as i just described the enterprise venture with verizon and our previously announced venture with goldman we will need to increase investments to ready our synchronoss universal id solution to fully commercialize the platform in addition to a lesser degree we will make incremental investments as we are pulled – being pulled into a new vertical market beyond the big three that we initially targeted which now includes government along with previously announced markets of finance health sciences and pharmaceuticals in  well be working with verizon to commercialize the synchronoss universal id platform to migrate highquality prospect space that we started to work with based on a set of marquee customers with whom weve been working on – who had been working on an initial version of the product – and have been moved over to synchronoss as part of the venture we have been focused on building a subscription revenue stream for the future we believe our investments in the goldman sachs and verizon ventures during  will put in place the foundation to drive significant growth of high visibility during  and beyond there will be some shortterm costs associated with these investments but we believe we will gain leverage on these investments as we have historically done and well be in a much better place to scale beyond the  billion in revenue level over the long term with a much more highly diversified customer base and yet despite all these investments in these new enterprise efforts and additional support as i discussed earlier in our international business we still expect to generate substantial growth in free cash flow that will hit record levels at synchronoss in  simply put our cloud offerings continue to grow to the majority of our revenues and when you combine the higher cloud margin profiles and the result of the faster than expected adoption and acceptance of our virtualization strategy should result in expected higher gross margins and substantial free cash flow in summary its a very exciting time at synchronoss and we remain very encouraged by the companys execution against our strategic progression in our core growth initiatives and excited about the expansion of our value proposition and new market opportunities in enterprise we have a proven history of execution launching and scaling new offerings and leveraging technology opportunities into something that becomes much bigger with that let me turn it over to karen karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp thanks and good morning everyone as steve reviewed our business performed well in  i will now review our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and will finish by providing our guidance for the first quarter and full year  starting with the income statement gaap revenues were  million for the fourth quarter nongaap revenues after adding back  of deferred revenue writedowns from certain acquisitions were  million which were at the high end of our guidance and up  on a yearoveryear basis our nongaap cloud services revenue in the fourth quarter was  million which represented  of our total revenue and yearoveryear growth of  our cloud business continues to benefit from strong adoption of our solution across all of our carrier customers and particularly at verizon which outperformed expectations in the quarter our nongaap activation services revenue was  million for the fourth quarter representing  of our total revenue roughly flat yearoveryear due to the timing of the ramping up of the international deals breaking revenue down further  of our fourth quarter nongaap revenue came from recurring sources namely transaction processing and subscription arrangements while the other  came from nonrecurring sources namely professional services and licenses as a reminder our revenue streams from our activation and cloud businesses generally consist of  to  transaction and subscription revenue and  to  professional service and license revenue with quartertoquarter variability turning to costs and expenses we will review our numbers both on a gaap and nongaap basis a full reconciliation table between the two can be found in our earnings release which is located on the investor relations section of our website nongaap gross profit in the quarter was  million or a gross margin of  which is consistent with the last several quarters as weve said in the past there will always be a certain amount of variability in our gross margins depending upon the mix of revenue and investments nongaap income from operations was  million in the fourth quarter representing an operating margin of   basis points above the top end of our guidance range during the quarter our operating margins benefited from the increased mix of business coming from our cloud business nongaap net income attributable to synchronoss in the fourth quarter was  million which led to a nongaap eps of   above the high end of our guidance range based on a  nongaap tax rate our nongaap tax rate was positively impacted by the permanent extension of the us rd tax credit which occurred at the end of the year this contributed approximately  to eps in the quarter on a gaap basis fourth quarter gross profit was  million income from operations was  million and gaap fully diluted earnings per share was  looking at our cash total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million an increase of  million from  million at the end of the third quarter the change in our cash balance includes the benefit of improved dso as well as our  million investment in the verizon venture made in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we generated  million in nongaap cash from operations compared to  million in the yearago period nongaap cash from operations excludes the payments for additional purchase price for acquisition earnouts and the excess tax benefit of exercising of stock options for the fullyear  we generated  million in nongaap cash from operations compared to  million for the fullyear  capital expenditures were  million for the fourth quarter and  million for the full year  representing  of total revenue down from  last year as a reminder while there will continue to be some quartertoquarter variability we expect our capex spend to trend lower over time as we recognize the efficiencies of moving towards a more virtualized softwarecentric model as a result during the full year  the company generated  million in nongaap free cash flow up from approximately breakeven last year we expect this trend to continue to improve over time as i will discuss in a few minutes with that let me turn to the guidance starting with the full year  nongaap revenues are expected to be in the range of  million to  million representing yearoveryear growth of approximately  at the midpoint breaking our revenue guidance down further we currently anticipate our cloud services revenue will be in the range of  million to  million or growth of  at the midpoint of our range included in this guidance is the expectation that our enterprise business will generate revenue in singledigit range keep in mind our enhanced solutions in the secure mobility suite in collaboration with our goldman sachs and verizon ventures are expected to be available in the second quarter and second half of the year respectively it takes time to finalize contracts and then for the resulting subscription revenue stream to build while revenue contribution in  will be fairly small we expect to build a foundation for strong growth in those areas in  we currently anticipate our activation services revenue will be in the range of  million to  million or a growth of approximately  at the midpoint of our range we believe we are taking an appropriately conservative view on our activation business to start the year until we have better visibility into the timing of certain international deployments in addition and as probably most of you know and have seen in their  forecast on their earnings call from our customers in the past few weeks there is a large range of variability in smartphone forecasts in  impact of expected new promotions and the strength of potential new device launches turning to profitability we currently expect nongaap gross margins in the  to  range with usual quartertoquarter variability in terms of operating profitability we expect nongaap operating margins of  to  leading to a nongaap eps of  to  assuming a tax rate of  and  million diluted shares to put our nongaap eps guidance in more perspective the incremental investments required to support todays announcement with verizon and the launch of our universal id platform is approximately  to  per share for  without this investment impact our nongaap eps would have been  to  per share based on the revenue assumptions we just discussed also keep in mind on our last call we discussed that our goldman sachs secure mobility venture would be dilutive in  by approximately  to  per share for the full year and approaching breakeven by the end of the year there is no change to our views on this front it is important to note that we expect the dilutive impact from our investments in the enterprise space which includes our ventures to be the largest in the first quarter and improve throughout the year as subscription revenue ramps in addition we expect the enterprise unit to have a positive earnings contribution for the full year  turning to cash flow as steve pointed out earlier we expect to achieve substantial growth in free cash flow during  as our model scales more efficiently we currently expect capex to be approximately  million to  million or approximately  to  of total revenue this would be in line with  and down from  in  while we have not historically provided guidance on free cash flow directionally we wanted to share our expectation that free cash flow is expected to grow  to  in  achieving historical highs after going from breakeven in  to  million in  on a nongaap basis this highlights the power of our business model as we move to a virtualized infrastructure at the same time we are increasing investments in strategic growth initiatives as we discussed earlier turning to the first quarter we are currently targeting nongaap revenues in the range of  million to  million which represents yearoveryear growth of approximately  to  we expect nongaap gross margins will be  to  nongaap operating margins will be between  to  and nongaap eps will be approximately  to  assuming a tax rate of  and a diluted share count of approximately  million shares before i close id like to announce that we will be hosting our fourth annual analyst day in the first half of the year at synchronosss headquarters in bridgewater new jersey we plan to share greater insight into our strategy to capitalize on the multiple growth opportunities in front of us including our new enterprise business we look forward to seeing many of you there in summary the fourth quarter was a solid finish to a solid  during the year we made tremendous progress across our business which positions us well for the future we believe the incremental investments we are making in  will position synchronoss well to achieve its longerterm goals of significant scale and profitability and we expect to realize the benefits of our increasingly virtualized infrastructure in  as free cash flow scales meaningfully with that let me turn it back to the operator to begin the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you the first question is from tom roderick of stifel your line is open tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey guys good morning thanks for taking my question let me start here first with the cloud business great to see such a big beat on that business a couple questions around that in the quarter i was hoping you could talk about how much of that – i know the recurring number i think you said came in at  recurring – but just if you could break that apart and give us some flavor for how much of the cloud business was professional services this quarter particularly knowing that youre guiding a little bit more sharply seasonally down in q for the whole business than we might typically be used to so trying to get a flavor for how much of that was perhaps nonrecurring cloud versus a view on activation for q and then second part of the question would just be seems like verizon continues to outperform very handily is that a relationship that you think can still grow i dont know how you would characterize the growth for  but any direction you can give us on the nature of verizon for this year would be fantastic stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer sure hey tom so this is steve we dont break out the individual subscriptions between cloud and activation but i will tell you that obviously as i mentioned some of the activation deployments which were primarily transactionbased impacted part of the quarter ratio between recurring and nonrecurring and i also encourage with some of the new enterprise efforts specifically on the verizon venture that we mentioned today its a new initiative and a new program that were working on not just with verizon across the base and so typically at the front end of those processes there is a little bit more service or license revenue i look – i encourage investors to go back in time when we launched the cloud at verizon in general if you look at those initial quarters theyre roughly in this range and then you can see subsequently in the outer quarters out it goes back up to the high s we would expect a similar pattern to follow here and then secondly were excited about the verizon relationship our cloud product is one of the most if not the most successful application theyve ever deployed to their consumers and so its given us an opportunity to partner with them to take some of these initial assets in our enterprise endeavor and move it forward and so we see a lot of growth opportunity in verizon not just in the traditional core business tom that youve been familiar with but part of this venture has us servicing a bunch of enterprise accounts as well as offering additional services that we can integrate across verizons enterprise in general tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc and following up on that point steve so it sounds like maybe but i guess the question here would be can you talk a little bit more about the financial arrangement i wrote down in my notes here something like a  million investment in the jv so maybe you can tell me if i got that right but id love to hear more about what the nature of that financial relationship looks like sounds like youre taking over a handful of enterprise customers whats the timing on that what are the commitments behind that how comfortable can we get here that theres some visibility in terms of the timing and scale of what youre sort of buying into here on the jv stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer no great question tom so we basically made an investment in the jv were the majority owner as part of that we basically got a set of marquee enterprise accounts that will be moving over to synchronoss that were previously serviced by verizon at the same time verizons also made a commitment to synchronoss in two areas one is to deploy the technology internally as well as working with us to go across their subscriber base in the next few years so if you think about the opportunity of that commitment and the visibility think of us becoming an industry standard for lack of a better word by getting almost a third of the us market so the opportunity is that well be taking over a bunch of these accounts that weve worked with during  that have expressed interest in moving to our version that i discussed earlier on the call which is our virtualized – kind of – were calling it version  as we get more mature well have more data around that tom but a way to think of the business is that were going to be building out a new generation of it thats going to be targeted to a set of these marquee accounts that will go into the new enterprise venture at the same time weve established a new call it not a channel but a new opportunity that verizons made financial commitments to synchronoss over the next few years tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc great karen last one i think this is probably best aimed at you but just in terms of the activation business and some of the challenges in the visibility the last few quarters on that how much of those challenges in visibility would you sort of ascribe to the ramp in international business or sort of lack thereof and when do you get more clarity on that and then how much is just related to broader macro challenges around handset sales and whats going on inside of att karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp tom so its a combination of the two so clearly we are being cautiously optimistic about our international deployment we wanted to clearly continue to take a pretty conservative approach on the forecast particularly in that activation primarily associated with those international deployment areas stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yeah and to add a little bit of color tom too this is steve is that when we think of some of these deployments we mentioned some investments as part of our standard business were going to add additional service delivery groups in regions to help some of the newer wins get over the line here and working with the carrier and so some of that obviously has variability to it so we factor that in our forward view the second part of it is just in general our clients going into this year as it relates to smartphones have a cautious view for the year there are promotions that are being deployed i think some of them that have recently been announced is atts directv integration with unlimited wireless and if theyre successful andor there are new device launches during the course of the year that become more visible then we get more comfortable on it but as we sit here today given some of the discussions that weve had with the carriers weve taken a more what we think is conservative approach in terms as the year falls out to see exactly what the impact of some of these smartphone headwinds are tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you guys i appreciate it operator thank you the next question is from sterling auty of jpmorgan your line is open sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc yeah thanks hi guys steve i guess i just wasnt quite clear on the international timing of activations i know you just said it but is this stuff where you have clarity on when theyre actually going to launch or turn and go live with the activation platform or is it a question of ramping within those accounts and is it more than one account stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer theres a few accounts so we have clarity that these accounts im trying to move towards production without giving specifics there are some internal hurdles that we help them with to be able to roll out as you guys know our solutions arent independent of an internal infrastructure and its harder for us since we have been public to predict exactly what month or what quarter those hurdles get accomplished so that we can then see that transaction volume and so going forward these accounts we still believe will come into production how quickly they do and the internal channels that were working on them what were doing to help them is to add additional service delivery folks in the regions on some of these accounts but as we sit here today we took a more cautious view knowing that those opportunities may take a little bit longer to come to fruition sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc got you and what was the – you slipped in a comment about activation on amazoncom but i wasnt quite clear what it is that you would actually be activating stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yeah so basically what amazon has as you can tell from pure distribution is starting to actually sell not just wireless services but indirect broadband capability and so amazon has selected synchronoss to run north america to start in which any customer that goes onto an amazon site and buys something thats associated with potentially moving or going to a new area will offer our broadband services and amazon is requiring all the independent cable operators and broadband providers to work through our gateway to transact that activation very similar to the way att uses us to manage their indirect channel today sterling its very similar so as they drive more volume well be connected in with all the cable and all the different providers that want to offer their services on amazon and well get paid a transaction to complete that activation sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc and then last question on the cloud side  growth at the midpoint im guessing a lot of the growth for this year really depends on the timing of some of the golives that you discussed both for the second quarter on some of the carriers but also some of the migration of the fsecure properties is that correct and is there any leeway either potential pushbacks or even potential pullforwards in the timing of any of those golives stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer so these golives are scheduled to – theyre happening on schedule as i mentioned the migrations – good question sterling – as well as even the initial releases with att we believe based on the history of verizon and others that theres always tweaking to marketing offers as well as just getting it and moving it around into the marketing flow and so the key variable for us this year given that most of these come on towards the latter half of the year is really the run rate exiting the year and to the extent that that kicks in a little bit earlier in q that could have a positive effect we took a more prudent approach as we think towards the holiday season but to the extent that things materialized over the summer faster and quicker as some folks have talked about then that would be great sterling auty  jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you operator thank you and the next question is from michael nemeroff with credit suisse your line is open michael nemeroff  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thanks thanks for taking my question steve and karen just to follow up on the previous question just to be clear steve the amazon relationship is strictly for working with their cable properties or does that not include cellular communication the wireless cell phones stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer initially yeah its going to be all broadband providers that and thats not just cable its anybody thats selling broadband that wants to work through verizon – or amazon as a channel thats where were initially starting there is opportunities to expand it not just in the product set as you discussed from a wireless perspective but also even out of the us into other international regions but to start were going to start with north america in direct broadband michael nemeroff  credit suisse securities usa llc broker great great and then steve what gives you the confidence in the rollout of the att new locker program did you have any visibility into some of the marketing efforts that att is going to be putting forth with that new product similar to how verizon came out with them where everything planned and it really kind of exploded with the couple of quarters of really strong subscriber growth stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yeah we do have without obviously getting anything we cant discuss publicly we do get visibility into some of the marketing plans and were encouraged about the approach going forward that being said we count it out a little bit as we go through the year is that att is just absorbing a large acquisition with directv got a lot of other initiatives that they have going on but we are pleased mike with the way they envision how the cloud will become an integral part of their process going forward and that is also true michael across all of our customers you saw we announced this past quarter a survey that we had done that really resonated strongly with a lot of our service provider customers and that was around the importance of cloud the amount of just pure data thats showing up on these smartphones just taking hours in the stores i mean its exponentially growing and so the cloud allows you to essentially back up and – back up while you sleep sync while you sleep and show up to the store to buy a new device so theres a whole new set of value props that the carriers and operators are seeing as it relates to the cloud when you throw some of the marketing promotions around it and how really going forward especially if youre offering bundled services like a company like att would offer that personal cloud information across devices across automotive across digital life across different aspects of your life becomes even more critical for them to maintain that customer relationship michael nemeroff  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful and just lastly for karen on the gross margin guidance of  to  im curious why the downtick over  given that more of the revenue is going to be coming from transactional – more subscriptionrelated revenue im curious why the conservatism in that line specifically karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp sure so primarily you know that we just entered into these ventures with goldman sachs and verizon as well as the formation of the enterprise business unit itself there are investments that we need to make in that area and those – some of those investments are up in that cost of services section of the income statement and clearly we are – moving forward were going to be developing that subscription revenue but that does take some time so there is cost associated with the development of that revenue stream in the cost of services number and thats why there is some – there is definitely conservatism in there but i would say that its clearly around investments that were making in that space stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yeah michael this is steve in the script we kind of broke out the eps impact of verizon we didnt update the gross margins they clearly would be better had we not had the impact to karens point karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp right stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer so we didnt break out both sides of it if you take kind a look at the eps impact you could probably get – get to that number mike michael nemeroff  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great thanks for taking my questions stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer thanks operator thank you and the next question is from nandan amladi of deutsche bank your line is open nandan g amladi  deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer hi nandan nandan g amladi  deutsche bank securities inc so karen historically capex has been a pretty good leading indicator and now with more virtualization youre expecting your own capex to be lower than its been historically so what should investors look for as leading indicators for new business coming online karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp no youre right the capex has been a leading indicator before but that was under our different model where we were doing most of the hosting in that cloud services area so clearly as we go into the virtualized environment theres going to be a lower capex spend and some of the ways that you can think of that moving forward is that as steve mentioned on the call in the past if you go back into that   range –  and  years when we were making some decent investments in the cloud you saw that our nonrecurring was a lower percentage of our revenue than it had been in high  range and so if you take a look at couple of quarters where youll see in that midtoupper  range couple of quarters after that we get back into the high  range on our recurring revenue stream so clearly were making investments now as we move towards later periods of stronger recurring revenue streams stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yeah one thing nandan this is steve to add a little color to karens point when we get involved in either additional license upfront or service revenues its typically to get the customers to a recurring model karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp yeah stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer so if you think of some of the venture work we mentioned on the call even with the verizon new jv as we move to the current version and we get some license and service revenue the goal when we announce later this year when we go to our new generation product it is a subscriptionbased model but some of the work that weve accomplished here so if you go back in time when we get to the lower end of the revenue recurring bands and because theyre service work youd typically look in the outer quarters again it may take a quarter or two youll see the acceleration in the revenue and the transactional recurring revenue go up as well karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp right nandan g amladi  deutsche bank securities inc thanks i had a followup if i might kind of related thematically youve launched new programs with new customers there is this new enterprise business how do we gauge progress on the individual lines or progress with individual customers or programs because historically its been relatively easy activation was mostly att and cloud was mostly verizon but now with all these other programs coming online are you planning to provide a little more granularity in the customerspecific progress stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yeah yeah i think what we were – what were going to do this year nandan is especially in our analyst day to give you a little bit more color not just on how we see our longterm operating model because clearly the enterprise business has a different margin profile we believe even stronger than our current cloud profile and so we want to give you some insight into not only how that looks but also as we build out towards that  billion business what are some of the metrics that were looking on as it relates to percentage of – one of the big drivers in our business is although weve had success in our core business it is a concentrated business and so we do have concentrated revenue streams albeit with the best communication service providers in the world what were going to do is show you the opportunity that not only will this improve the margin profile of the company in the outer years but it absolutely will bring us a much more highly diversified customer base with customers like goldmanlike quality andor some of these marquee accounts that were taking over from verizon our brand name enterprise accounts that do drive the industry and so some of that metric in terms of how we see it going forward with these investments is something that well give you guys a little bit more visibility because to your point nandan it is different nandan g amladi  deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator thank you the next question is from tavis mccourt of raymond james your line is open tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc hey steve and karen this is tavis a few different questions karen it looked like on the cash flow statement there was cash for an acquisition in the quarter was that an acquisition or a payout on a previous acquisition karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp no that was this  million investment in the verizon venture tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc oh okay and so i want to make sure i understand the structure of the enterprise group so the verizon venture within the enterprise group is a separate venture than the goldman sachs venture is that the right way to think about it karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp that is correct stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc and you are a majority owner of both ventures karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp that is correct as well tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc okay and you mentioned an earnings dilution from verizon i think  was the midpoint can you remind us what the midpoint of the earnings dilution from the goldman sachs venture is karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp  tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc okay so in aggregate  and you think that aggregate  is neutral or positive in  karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp yes we believe tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc okay karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp it will have a positive impact in  stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes we havent provided obviously any formal guidance karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp right stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer tavis but we believe that – and its based on two premises one is that one of the reasons these jvs are strategic to the company is theres a lot of companies out there spending a ton of money on sales and marketing to try to increase their penetration across the fortune  weve had great success already out of the gate in lining up a robust pipeline through goldman as well as verizon literally giving us a handful of these enterprise accounts that well take over and so our assumption is well build the platform weve got a very captive distribution channel that isnt as expensive as others that the combination of two will drive that profitability into  and beyond tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc and then i guess bigger picture on enterprise group i mean this almost feels like a cohort of east coastbased software companies trying to take on silicon valley whats to say ge doesnt come to you three weeks from now and you start yet another venture with ge thats dilutive upfront or do you think this is enough to chew on for the next couple of years stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer well i think for us we clearly have enough to move going forward just so you know the nature of the jv ill give you kind of high level strategic thoughts about why we created these and even without giving specifics on how our partners think of it if you think about our relationship with goldman is that theyve established a piece of software thats very unique to that industry that is very easy to use well weve already started to commercialize it internally i believe its far and above anything ive seen out there in terms of ease of use when you combine that with our workspace and our secure components of it it creates something thats very unique in the market goldmans longterm business is banking and technology enables that theyre not intended to be in the business for an extended period of time and without getting specifics there are metrics associated with us down the road being able to give goldman a good return our shareholders a good return and then moving on from the venture and so when you think about the way these companies approach us being able to tie them into our success and creating more of an open standard makes a lot of sense so we see these jvs basically jumpstarting our business reducing our distribution getting us into the right people quickly which were seeing already the verizon instance obviously they are very focused across a bunch of lines of businesses we have a very proven track record there delivering very large scalable software products i think their belief is that were able to take these products and scale them quicker and be much more agile with their customers given all of the different initiatives that theyre focused on a daily basis and so those are the primary reasons why we set it out so i do think that this provides a great foundation going forward tavis i dont say that we have anything else in mind but i want to make sure i share a little bit of insight that over time as the enterprise business starts to scale in the next three four five years these partners may move on with a nice return and synchronoss has a very profitable enterprise unit tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc got you so karen owning a majority all the revenues are consolidated on the income statement and assets are consolidated on the balance sheet and therell be some kind of minority interest line item that backs out the losses and quarterly gains from these ventures is that how well see it on the financial statements karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp yes it is tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc okay and then i just want to make sure i understood correctly on the four cloud ramps you mentioned for this year all of those will be kind of softwarecentric virtualized do you know that for sure at this point stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes theres nothing – one of the things that gives us the confidence is that we were able now coming out of the year as we got there faster – is that we really dont offer a capex solution to our customers the options are they do it internally while we use one of our thirdparties we obviously have a relationship with amazon and others that well use to go to market with tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc great and then last question when you break out the recurring and nonrecurring revenues is the activation revenues that are transactional those you include under recurring correct karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp yes its transaction and subscription on the recurring side tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc okay so when we see yearoveryear recurring growth relatively low this quarter that includes the impact of potentially what was a pretty weak quarter in transactional volumes at carriers is that correct stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer thats correct thats absolutely a contributor most of the – and on the international specific one – it was all transactional revenue that would have been coming into the equation thats pushed out a little bit had that come in if you just did the math youll end up seeing stronger on the recurring side as well tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc got you thanks very much stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer thanks tavis karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp thank you operator thank you the next question is from gray powell of wells fargo securities your line is open gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc hi guys thanks for taking the call i just have one question with  subparts okay maybe to start off can you give us a sense as to linearity of the activation business in  i think you said  growth for the full year it declined  in q so does guidance imply something like a highsingledigit exit rate in  karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp yes by the end of the year that would be the case gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just longer term for that business you are kind of still thinking of it as sort of like a highsingledigit growth rate stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes we havent provided a highsingledigit it could go to the lowdoubledigit growth depending upon how successful we are internationally the other component it does create across the industry as you probably saw is when theres a new device thats launched and its a new form factor like if you look at the  which is relatively same device versus the transformational was one last year and then as you move to a new form factor it does have a big jumpup so you can get into the – to have an impact to us to maybe push us into the lowteen range but thats a fair way to think about it gray gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just one more if i may can you talk about the pace of growth of your nonverizon cloud customers in  relative to the total cloud business stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes so i think the way to describe the reaction in  was it was more on execution in other words we had a lot of accounts that – especially some of the newer ones – that we won late in the year that were moving online over the ones that we got through our fsecure acquisition of those assets were really around getting them not to scale on the old infrastructure but to get them to scale on our new infrastructure going forward which is why i think were continuing to see the benefits of the margin profile in our business and so that was successful so we looked at it as not high growth frankly in  or not high growth from now to mid its really once these have finished migration and the marketing programs go up now weve got them in the right infrastructure virtualized on our platform and we can really get the economics to scale towards the end of year so weve focused exclusively on getting them migrated into an environment that we know has an operating model that we can make good margin expansion on and then scaling those in the latter half of the year so that we think of our exit run rate very similar to our first year at verizon as a really good indicator exiting the year as we set the stage for  and all of those remain on track as we speak gray w powell  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you very much karen l rosenberger  chief financial officer treasurer  executive vp thank you operator thank you the next question is from greg burns of sidoti  co your line is open greg j burns  sidoti  co llc hi just a question on the verizon partnership it sounded like you mentioned that they could potentially be rolling out to their wireless consumers and offering in like – it sounds like – use it in like online ecommerce transactions for consumers and things of that nature so how big is the opportunity outside of the enterprise market on the consumer side for this type of offering stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes so without getting obviously any specifics around verizon i can say that the consumer offerings really the large play certainly the enterprise adoption is good and it gets us additional customers and honestly its a good pull through for secure mobility suite because as you authenticate on a network and again you partner with companies like att or verizon and you can extend some of the lagoon capabilities in the network which no other mobile security vendor is going to have that capability its a definitely high pull through the real big play though to your point is absolutely in the consumer market as people have multifactor authentication the concept is that you create this passport of your information thats not just works at verizon it works at banking it works at the grocery market it really allows you to go really broad in doing all kinds of bb and bc transactions and ultimately whats exciting for us is we believe well get critical mass at a fraction of the cost that others have to do to try to get there based on these venture greg j burns  sidoti  co llc okay thank you operator thank you we have a followup question from tom roderick of stifel your line is open tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey guys quick followup question a little bit philosophical here but youve done a lot of great things to build the business longerterm in the past year particularly the last kind of six months clouds doing what you wanted to do it its exceeding expectations perhaps a little low on the activation business and you said on over  million in cash and equivalents here with the stock where its at where is your head at with respect to trying to create or unlock a little bit more value in the business perhaps thinking about a stock buyback how do you think about other ways to add shareholder value with the stock where its at right now stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer yes so hey tom its steve so we look at all kinds of ways to add incremental value to all of our shareholders we certainly have discussed internally buybacks as well as that cash to us allows us to quickly move into other areas whether we want to get more aggressive on our ma front so theres other types of kind of strategic things we think about in terms of growing the longerterm value whats been important to us is i think weve demonstrated that when we went from activation to cloud that we made some investments and got it to scale and the business continues to perform well and really at the end of the day i believe that the biggest initiative at the company is to focus on going forward is really diversifying our customer base into new markets and thats a big reason why the enterprise play makes a lot of sense and as i had mentioned earlier the other factor to that had to be that we could find a way to make our core communication service providers partners in that business and i think you see the announcement today with verizon exemplifies that were implementing that strategy and so when i think about the forward view and how to deploy capital and share buybacks and different things we are absolutely focused on growing that core business but absolutely taking investments this year that you see from the dilutive effect of these two things and invest those into the future so that three years from now we believe for our shareholders if we had  million plus revenue opportunity across  large enterprise accounts with a much different margin profile we believe that the value that the company would get would be dramatically different than where it is today and given that we want to make sure we have enough capital to be able to make those aggressive moves to quickly climb up that scale for longterm value and so we try to balance that with the need to also be conscious of our shareholders and conscious on the needs and the benefits that a buyback would give us and it is absolutely a big discussion that we have at our board level every time tom roderick  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it thanks steve appreciate it stephen g waldis  founder chairman  chief executive officer thanks tom operator thank you and there are no further questions in queue at this time ill turn the call back over for closing remarks stephen g waldis  founder
