 white star capital leads series a investment into keyme to help you digitalize your keys and never be locked out again white star capital menu en fr white star capital leads series a investment into keyme to help you digitalize your keys and never be locked out again 6 april 0 by christian hernandez gallardo last december i came across a partnership between d printing company shapeways and a company called keyme to digitally scan your keys with a smartphone  i was intrigued and as i dug into it discovered that my friend amol was an angel investor in keyme  email introductions quickly followed and greg marsh keyme’s ceo and i were in touch a few hours after i first saw the article fast forward three months and i am really excited to see white star capital leading the funding for keyme’s m series a round alongside seed investor battery ventures and with participation from eleven’s venture arm as a consumer keyme is a fantastic insurance product that allows you to create a digital version of your keys and order copies whenever you want  if you are locked out you can simply ask for a locksmith to come to you or walk into a eleven or bed bath  beyond and print yourself a key from a keyme kiosk  soon you’ll be able to d print one too the proposition is simple … but makes so much sense keyme combines the ubiquity of smartphones with clever image recognition technology sensible security precautions and a brilliant gotomarket strategy to ensure you can get a copy of your keys or get back into your home in the case of a lockout it solves both passive issues new copies and dire issues lockouts and it does so seamlessly keyme is a great example of smartphone apps and services that let you “remote control” aspects your life  as smartphone penetration accelerates and as the computational power on the device combines with the storage and computational power in the cloud we will see more and more of what the tech press are calling “ondemand mobile services” existing examples include hailo which allows you to hail a cab justeat which ensures you are fed airbnb which helps you find somewhere to stay and homejoy which ensures your home is clean when you arrive over the past few months the white star team has spent a lot of time with greg kris the cto and keyme’s clients  after every single meeting we got more and more excited about the simple elegance of the technology the clear value to consumers retail partners and key manufacturers in a massively fragmented space white star capital is very proud to be leading keyme’s series a and i am personally excited to be joining keyme’s board of directors to work alongside the greg and team to scale out this amazing business  my home and office keys have already been digitized and i invite you to do the
