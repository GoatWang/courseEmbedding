corporation state information about about us why choose us testimonials contact dashboard login incorporate now why thousands of small business owners choose incfile scroll down deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process there are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies  value – nobody gives you more for less  more first and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is  plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you less  registered agent service  st year free  more each of our  packages include a  free year of registered agent service if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish after the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of  we do not ever under any circumstance charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment information we only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say  weeks or  months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state less  transparency  more we have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation is complete on the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity type have been selected titled state compulsory filing requirements we strongly urge you to review this link as many states ie nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the entity being filed the link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost less  notifications  more all of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of important filing dates regarding their entities these emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates less  internal documents  more it is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization  incorporation with the state depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an llc or the directors and shareholders of a corporation we create custom operating agreements for the lllc which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member in addition we also create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the directors and shareholders as well as the number of shares that each shareholder owns the internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the statement of the organizer  incorporator and banking resolutions if changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they can be customized as needed less  electronic copies  more we know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every filing in digital format should you need it in the future less  privacy  more you can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such we do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in we also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site ie social security numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed less  sales practices  more we do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company we only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs even though it is much more profitable for us we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location we would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken follow the link for more information regarding this less  experience  more when we entered this industry in  the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today we have formed well over  companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence what that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the  states less  humility  more at the end of the day we know that we are not perfect we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live person however if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to man the phones if you do need to reach us immediately the

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or

double taxation that is one tax at the corporate level on the corporations net income and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed s corporations have only one level of taxation all of their income is allocated to the shareholders however c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability in addition s corporations are subject to limitations such as the number and type of shareholders they can have legalzoom will help you start a c corporation or an s corporation get started by answering a few questions about your company and we will file your paperwork with the secretary of state how do i choose a corporate name in general the name of a corporation must end with incorporated corporation or an abbreviation of one of these a name will not be accepted if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name of another corporation already formed in that state many states also restrict the use of certain terms in a corporations name like bank police or insurance legalzoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names in order of preference we will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are available please note that for government purposes the names abc inc and abc corp are identical therefore you should disregard spaces periods and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name choices if the name of your corporation will be used in connection with goods or services you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark protection for the name this helps ensure that no one else in the us may use that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services except in areas where someone else is already using that name is a corporation required to have a registered agent each corporation must have a registered agent some states use the term resident agent or statutory agent but the concept is the same this is the person designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the corporation is served with a lawsuit most states require that the registered agent must be either  an adult living in the state of formation with a street address po boxes are not acceptable or  a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation that provides registered agent services one of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is that any officer or director of a corporation or manager or member of an llc can act as the registered agent however there are some advantages to having another person or company act as your registered agent first this adds an extra layer of privacy since the registered agents name and address are publicly available second this helps limit the risk that if your corporation or llc is named as a defendant in a lawsuit no one will surprise you at home on a sunday night with court papers how much will it cost to form and run a corporation each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation in many states you must also submit an annual report or list of directors and
