providersummarybrookfield investment management proposes consolidation of three closedend fundsthe board of directors for each of the three funds has approved the merger now its up to the shareholdersis it a good idea maybe brookfield investment management inc a wholly owned subsidiary of brookfield asset management inc nysebam has recently proposed to consolidate three of its proprietary closedend funds the news came in a press release dated may th  and has the approval of the boards of each fund the funds in question are the brookfield mortgage opportunity income fund nyseboi the brookfield total return fund nysehtr and the brookfield high income fund nysehhy the three funds pending approval from shareholders will be combined into one fund which would be called the brookfield real assets income fund the ra fund a special shareholder meeting to discuss and vote on the merger has been scheduled for august th  the boards of each fund have approved the deal believing it is in the best interest of shareholders the combined fund would provide a better opportunity for income income growth and capital appreciation the funds strategy would be a combination of strategy employed by the individual components providing a multiasset multiportfolio manager approach intended to create more stable income streams with less volatility across market cycles additional benefits include increased demand on the secondary market due to the larger asset size and enhanced cost savings over time brookfield investment management is an sec registered investment adviser providing strategies in globally listed real estate and infrastructure corporate credit and securitized credit the firm has over  billion under management for clients including financial institutions pension plans sovereign wealth funds and high net worth individuals the brookfield real asset income fund the strategy of the new fund will be a combination of strategy employed by the three smaller funds it will be a diversified multiasset multiportfolio manager strategy seeking to provide real returns above and beyond the broad market throughout the market cycle and not tied to the performance of traditional stocks and bonds the fund will invest in infrastructure real estate and natural resources in addition to fixed income and other investable debt instruments also a small portion of the fund will be allocated to real asset equity positions management of the portfolio will be split between brookfields real assets credit investment team which currently manages the hhy the securitized products investment team which currently manages boi and htr and other teams under the umbrella of brookfield investment management inc the brookfield mortgage opportunity income fund is a diversified closedend fund focusing on the mortgage market the investment objective is high levels of current income with opportunity for capital appreciation over the long term as of last reporting the fund paid a dividend with yield near  the th quarter of steady and stable distribution the primary portfolio holdings are rmbs residential mortgage backed securities about  with a secondary allocation to subprime loans about  smaller allocations are given to commercial mortgage backed securities corporate bonds collateralized loan obligations and real estate based equities the fund is currently trading at a discount to nav in line with the historical average and up from a low near  set in late  the brookfield total return fund is another diversified closedend fund but with the objective of total returns including short and longterm capital gains as well as high current income the fund pays a dividend with yield near  at todays prices and has done so since mid  when distributions were increased the fund focuses on us treasuries mortgage and asset backed securities as well as high yield corporate bonds the top three allocations rmbs cmbs and subprime securities total nearly  of portfolio value with most rated bbb or lower the fund is currently trading at only a  discount to nav up from  months ago and well above the historical average of  the brookfield high income fund has the sole objective of high current income with a lesser focus on capital appreciation provided the primary objective is not compromised the fund also pays a dividend in the range of  at current share prices but this is down  as of the latest distribution the fund is nondiversified focusing on high yield bonds debentures and other corporate debt vehicles all with less than investment grade credit ratings or viewed as such by fund managers allocations within the fund allow up to  of nonus domiciled companies and  currently involved in bankruptcy proceedings on a sector by sector basis the highest concentration is in the energy sector just over  followed by telecommunications about  and leisure about  in terms of credit rating less than  are rated bbb or above and nearly  are rated b or lower to help garner shareholder support brookfield will cover the cost of restructuring so there is no fear of losing asset value during the transition other than what may normally occur due to market conditions also there will be a  year expense cap following the closing of the deal intended to keep the annualized expense ratio for the ra fund at or below  the company has contractually agreed to waive or reimburse the fund in order to maintain this target compared to the original three funds this expense ratio will be roughly equal to the brookfield total return fund and below that of the mortgage opportunity fund and the high income fund  once approved shareholders of the original funds will receive shares in the new fund based on net asset values brookfield investment management will be the funds adviser with the exception of the securitized credit portion of the portfolio more on that below the deal is contingent on each reorganization meeting shareholder approval all are required for the ra fund to come to fruition a subadviser has been nominated to handle the securitized credit portion of the portfolio schroder investment management north america schroder investment management recently entered a deal to buy brookfields securitized products investment team the reason behind the nomination as subadviser the deal is expected to close in the second half of  and is not contingent on the reorganization of the closedend funds likewise the reorganization of the fund is not contingent on the sale each are independent of the other however the appointment of schroder investment management as subadviser to the fund or funds is subject to shareholder approval and the close of the sale if the sale does not close brookfields securitized products team will remain as adviser to the individual funds or the combined fund whichever shareholders agree to my thoughts a merger of the boi and htr seems like a good idea these two funds invest in similar assets with similar objectives the hhy stands alone in both its target securities and investment objectives which along with the recent distribution cut make it less than complimentary owners of hhy will gain the benefits of a larger fund lower costs and stable dividend while owners of the other two may find their returns hampered in the end it will all come down to how the merger is effected and the objectives laid out in the official prospectus due to be released following sec approval of the registration statement disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
