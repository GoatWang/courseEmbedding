ill then wrap things up and well be glad to take questionsyesterday we reported second quarter net income of  million or  per share compared to last years second quarter net income of  million or  per share second quarter net income included net charges for the boise integration and the deridder louisiana mill restructuring of  million or  per shareexcluding special items net income was a record  million or  per share compared to last years net income of  million or  per share net sales were  billion in both the second quarter of  and as shown on slide four earnings of  per share were  higher than our prior guidance higher than guidance earning of  per share were driven by outstanding operations in both our mills and box plants especially considering that five of our mills were down during the quarter for their annual outages the benefits from the work we completed in the first quarter at the deridder mill during its extended annual outage were realized faster than we expectedthe ability to produce virgin highperformance linerboard grades on d plus the improvements we made on d allowed us to make more lightweight containerboard and other specialty grade at deridder and shift other grades to accounts in valdosta mills this resulted in record productivity on a tonsperday basis and lower mill cost at all three of these millsin corrugated products our sales mix improved seasonally more than we expected contributing another  per share in addition lower mill outage costs lower purchased pulp costs a lower tax rate and other items each contributed an additional  per share in earningslooking at slide five earnings were up  per share compared to the second quarter of  production in sales volume increase has added  per share to earnings a richer mix in corrugated products increased earnings by  per share lower energy costs increased earnings  per share lower chemical costs increased earnings  per share and a lower tax rate improved earnings over last years second quarter by about  per share these earnings improvements were partially offset by lower white paper prices and mix changes which reduced earnings by  per share higher labor and benefit costs of  per share lower export containerboard prices of  per share higher annual outage costs  per share and higher wood costs of  per shareebitda and margins in the packaging segments were up over second quarter of last year with ebitda of  million and sales of  billion or a  margin compared to the second quarter of  packaging ebitda of  million excluding special items with sales of  billion or a  marginmoving into more details of operations containerboard production in the second quarter was  tons up  tons compared to last years second quarter driven primarily by  tons or  tons per day produced on d machine at deridder the d machine produced  tons of linerboard and  tons of corrugating medium with the d production we reduced our upside purchases of containerboard by  tons compared to last years second quarter the d machine contributed about  per share to our second quarter earningswe plan to take our d machine down at deridder in september for  days to install additional dryers which will provide the capability to achieve full design capacity of  tons per day and lower cost we pulled up some work from next years deridder annual outage to better utilize the downtime and also accrue benefits earlierour containerboard inventory at the end of the second quarter was down  tons from yearend levels and about  tons below the end of the first quarter our ending inventory level at the end of the quarter is where we wanted to be to meet our seasonally stronger third quarter demand especially with the lost production from the planned d machine outage in september our containerboard inventories at our box plants are also higher than what weve historically carried as a result of transportation issues which i think most of you are familiar withread the rest of this
