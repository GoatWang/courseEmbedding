principal investors fund inc  applicants represent that the fund intends to and other insurance funds may in the future offer shares to separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies in order to fund variable contracts applicants further represent that these separate accounts are or will be registered as investment companies under the  act or will be exempt from such registration individually a “separate account” and collectively the “separate accounts” insurance companies whose separate accounts may now or in the future own shares are referred to herein as “participating insurance companies”  applicants represent that the participating insurance companies have established or will establish their own separate accounts and design their own variable contracts each participating insurance company has or will have the legal obligation to satisfy all applicable requirements under both state and federal law each participating insurance company may rely on rule e or rule et under the  act although in connection with the establishment and maintenance of separate accounts funding variable life insurance policies some participating insurance companies may rely on individual exemptive orders as well  applicants state that each participating insurance company on behalf of its separate accounts has entered or will enter into a participation agreement with each insurance fund in which it invests which will govern participation by the participating insurance company in such insurance fund a “participation agreement” the role of the insurance fund under this arrangement insofar as federal securities laws are applicable will consist of offering shares to the separate accounts and fulfilling any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order requested in the application  applicants propose that the insurance funds also be permitted to offer andor sell shares to qualified plans administered by a trustee section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of separate accounts funding variable contracts in particular the code provides that variable contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance policy for any period and any subsequent period for which the underlying assets are not in accordance start printed page with regulations prescribed by the treasury department adequately diversified on march   the treasury department issued regulations individually a “treasury regulation” and collectively the “treasury regulations” specifically treasury regulation section  that established diversification requirements for variable contracts which require the separate accounts upon which these contracts or policies are based to be diversified as provided in the treasury regulations in the case of separate accounts that invest in underlying investment companies the treasury regulations provide a “look through” rule that permits the separate account to look to the underlying investment company for purposes of meeting the diversification requirements provided that the beneficial interests in the investment company are held only by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies however the treasury regulations also contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which allows shares in an investment company to be held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by separate accounts funding variable contracts treas reg section fiii another exception allows the investment manager of the investment company and certain companies related to the investment manager to hold shares of the investment company an exception that is often used to provide the capital required by section a of the  act  qualified plans may choose the shares offered as the sole investment under the qualified plan or as one of several investments qualified plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the terms of the qualified plan itself exercise of voting rights by participants in any such qualified plans as opposed to the trustees of such qualified plans cannot be mandated by the applicants each qualified plan must be administered in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan and as determined by its trustee or trustees to the extent permitted under applicable law an adviser or an affiliated person of the adviser may act as investment adviser or trustee to qualified plans that purchase shares  applicants propose that the insurance funds also be permitted to offer andor sell shares to an adviser the treasury regulations permit such sales as long as the return on shares held by the adviser is computed in the same manner as for shares held by the separate accounts and the adviser does not intend to sell the shares to the public the treasury regulations restrict sales to an adviser to shares held only in connection with the creation of an insurance fund applicants represent that they anticipate that sales will be made to an adviser for the purpose of providing necessary capital required by section a of the  act applicants also represent that any shares purchased by an adviser will automatically be redeemed if and when the advisers investment advisory agreement terminates  applicants propose that the insurance funds also be permitted to offer andor sell shares to general accounts the treasury regulations permit sales to general accounts as long as the return on shares held by general accounts is computed in the same manner as for shares held by a separate account and the general accounts do not intend to sell the shares to the public applicants represent that they anticipate that sales may be made to general accounts for purposes of the creation of the insurance funds applicants legal analysis  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance policies issued through a separate account registered as a unit investment trust “uit” under the  act rule eb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any uit if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in section a or  of the  act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares rule eb provides these exemptions apply only where all of the assets of the uit are shares of management investment companies “which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company” therefore the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account or a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or any other affiliated company the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding”  the relief granted by rule eb also is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts issued by one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for separate accounts funding variable contracts issued by one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as “shared funding”  moreover because the relief under rule eb is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares are also to be sold to qualified plans an adviser and general accounts collectively “eligible purchasers” applicants note that if the shares were sold only to separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts andor eligible purchasers exemptive relief under rule eb would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to eligible purchasers or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to eligible purchasers the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for separate accounts funding variable contracts issued by affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies and for eligible purchasers is referred to herein as “extended mixed and shared funding”  in connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a uit rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the exemptions granted by rule etb are available only where all the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies that offer to sell their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the start printed page life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance companies offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account” therefore rule etb permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding  moreover because the relief under rule etb is available only where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts funding variable contracts issued by a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares are also to be sold to eligible purchasers as described above applicants note that if the shares were sold only to separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts andor eligible purchasers exemptive relief under rule etb would not be necessary the relief provided for under this section does not relate to eligible purchasers or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to eligible purchasers  applicants maintain as discussed below that there is no policy reason for the sale of the shares to eligible purchasers to result in a prohibition against or otherwise limit a participating insurance company from relying on the relief provided by rules eb and etb however because the relief under rules eb and etb is available only when shares are offered exclusively to certain separate accounts additional exemptive relief may be necessary if the shares are also to be sold to eligible purchasers applicants therefore request relief in order to have the participating insurance companies enjoy the benefits of the relief granted in rules eb and etb even where eligible purchasers are investing in the relevant insurance fund applicants note that if the shares were to be sold only to eligible purchasers andor separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts exemptive relief under rule eb and rule etb would be unnecessary the relief provided for under rules eb and etb does not relate to eligible purchasers or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to eligible purchasers  consistent with the commissions authority under section c of the  act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions the application requests relief for the class consisting of participating insurance companies and their separate accounts and to the extent necessary investment advisers principal underwriters and sponsors of such separate accounts  in effect the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the  act from the requirements of section  of the  act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to individuals in a large insurance complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply section a of the  act to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies that may utilize the insurance funds as investment vehicles for variable contracts applicants argue that there is no regulatory purpose in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of section as eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding or shared funding and sales to qualified plans an adviser or general accounts applicants represent that the participating insurance companies and qualified plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the insurance funds applicants further represent that those individuals who participate in the management of the insurance funds will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or qualified plans invest in the insurance funds applicants argue that applying the monitoring requirements of section a of the  act because of investment by separate accounts of participating insurance companies or qualified plans would be unjustified would not serve any regulatory purpose and could reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners and qualified plan participants due to the increased monitoring costs  rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract between such a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of rules ebi ebiia etbi and etbiia under the  act rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in an underlying funds investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of rules ebii ebiib ebiic etbii etbiib and etbiic under the  act  rule e under the  act recognizes that a variable insurance contract as an insurance contract has important elements unique to insurance contracts and is subject to extensive state regulation in adopting rule ebiii the commission expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters the commission also expressly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority to require an insurer to draw from its general account to cover costs imposed upon the insurer by a change approved by contract owners over the insurers objection the commission therefore deemed such exemptions necessary “to assure the solvency of the life insurer and performance of its contractual obligations by enabling an insurance regulatory authority or the life insurer to act when certain proposals reasonably could be expected to increase the risks undertaken by the life insurer” in this respect flexible premium variable life insurance contracts are identical to scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts applicants therefore assert that the corresponding provisions of rule et under the  act undoubtedly were adopted in recognition of the same factors  applicants also assert that the sale of shares to qualified plans an adviser and general accounts will not have any impact on the relief requested with respect to qualified plans which are start printed page not registered as investment companies under the  act shares of a portfolio of an investment company sold to a qualified plan must be held by the trustees of the qualified plan pursuant to section a of the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa” applicants note that  section a of erisa endows qualified plan trustees with the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies provided neither of two enumerated exceptions to that provision applies  some of the qualified plans may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants and  there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to qualified plan participants  applicants argue that an adviser and general accounts are similar in that they are not subject to any passthrough voting requirements applicants therefore conclude that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with eligible purchasers  applicants represent that where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions the trustee or named fiduciary has fiduciary responsibility to vote the shares held by the qualified plan in the best interest of the qualified plan participants accordingly applicants argue that even if an adviser or an affiliate of an adviser were to serve in the capacity of trustee or named fiduciary with voting responsibilities an adviser or its affiliates would have a fiduciary duty to vote relevant shares in the best interest of the qualified plan participants  further applicants assert that even if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in an insurance fund applicants do not believe such control would disadvantage other investors in such insurance fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in an insurance fund by a qualified plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding unlike mixed funding or shared funding applicants argue that qualified plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  where a qualified plan provides participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants see no reason to believe that participants in qualified plans generally or those in a particular qualified plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other qualified plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract holders applicants assert that the purchase of shares by qualified plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares to qualified plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between variable contract owners  applicants assert that permitting an insurance fund to sell its shares to an adviser or to the general account of a participating insurance company will enhance

shares insurance funds also will require more limited amounts of initial capital in connection with the creation of any new series of shares and the voting of initial shares of such series on matters requiring the approval of shareholders a potential source of the requisite initial capital is an insurance funds investment adviser or a participating insurance company either of these parties may have an interest in making the requisite capital investment and in participating with an insurance fund in its organization applicants note however that provision of seed capital or the purchase of shares in connection with the management of an insurance fund by its investment adviser or by a participating insurance company may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of rule eb andor rule etb  given the conditions of treas reg section f and the harmony of interest between an insurance fund on the one hand and an adviser or a participating insurance company on the other applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists applicants further assert that such investment should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts instead applicants argue that permitting investments by an adviser or by general accounts will permit the orderly and efficient creation of an insurance fund and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of the insurance funds operations applicants conditions applicants consent to the following conditions with respect to each insurance fund  a
