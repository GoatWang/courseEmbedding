net lease inc nysegnl  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»global net lease same song second versejul   about global net gnl brad thomas dividend growth investing reits newsletter provider valuemarketplacereit beatsummarywhile global net lease no longer has the scarlet letters – arc – it does have a seemingly cozy association with its external manageri believe a larger force behind gnl’s price decline has been the rush to the door sparked by other realty capital securities productsmaybe this is no “sucker yield” yet but all the glitters isn’t goldi can see why american realty capital global trust previously a nontraded reit decided to change its name to global net lease inc nysegnl a new publiclytraded net lease reit that began its first day of trading on june   with a name similar to american realty capital properties arcp its easy to associate the first three words american realty capital for a distrusted brand in which investors fell victim to illusions disguised by seemingly healthy dividend coverage however prompting that telegraphed fear related to arcps unsustainable dividend i opted to hit the brakes blasting arcp management for a flaw that seemed to be almost prophetic words a week later i screamed sucker yield as i explained on investopedia a sucker yield means that the dividend is too good to be true so when a company is paying a dividend beyond its earnings power it is essentially eroding capital accordingly global net lease opted to list shares without the american realty capital association hoping to create distance from the damaged net lease brand and its creator nicholas schorsch back in november  schorsch had his hands in a lot of pies so now mr market has adopted new this kid on the block and while the sonamed reit global net lease no longer has the scarlet letters  arc  it does have a seemingly cozy association with its external manager gnl has a fully integrated external management team and subadvisor by the name of ar capital guess who leads ar capital withstanding the fact that global net lease has very close ties with ar capital the global net lease management team has another cozy relationship with an existing nontraded reit by the name of arc global trust ii as of q arcg owned  properties and when you click on the realty capital securities website you will see the first fund identified now if you click on arcg you can see that the nontraded reit is attempting to raise  billion in  pershare increments where am i going with this its simple gnl may have changed its name but the newlylisted reit is being externally managed by arc capital in addition there are ongoing conflicts of interest in that gnl is competing directly with its nontraded reit american realty capital global ii furthermore and as i alluded in a previous article american finance trust inc pendingafin also a nontraded reit has the wheels in motion to list shares of its vintage arct fund by disguising afin as a hybrid commercial mortgage reit afin touts it will own both net lease properties as well as high risk commercial paper by combining the existing arct assets afin hopes to aggregate debt obligations to balance the portfolio with a proforma debtasset percentage of around  percent x to x debtequity if you like you can read my previous article on afin here and while i see considerable flaws in the proposed monetization the purpose for my article today is to explore the risks and rewards related to global net lease what is global net lease as noted above global net lease listed shares around a month ago and heres how the scorecard looks since the listing as typical to many nontraded reit listings gnl launched a tender offer to acquire a maximum of  million of its shares of common stock at  per share on june th dst systems inc the tender offers paying agent and depositary reported that a total of  shares of gnls common stock were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn including  shares that were tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery gnls portfolio consists of over  net lease properties and around  million square feet gnls total capitalization is  billion and heres how that compares to the peer group its interesting that gnl does not list arcp in the latest investor presentation im not sure why thats the case many of gnls us properties were acquired in  and   when arct and cole capital were also aggressively acquiring net lease properties gnl has  tenants doing business in  industries gnl owns around  percent of its properties outside of the us primarily the united kingdom  percent germany  percent netherlands  percent and finland  percent as noted above gnl relies on ar capital schorsch  co to source and acquire us properties and outside of the us in europe gnl looks to moor park capital partners to vet out deals in terms of a peer set closest to gnl i use wp carey nysewpc and gramercy property nysegpt  recently announced merger with chambers street nysecsg  see my recent article here in gnls investor presentation the company states that it is wellpositioned to capitalize on incremental investment opportunities in the us and western europe in europe gnl suggests there are over  trillion properties available with no publiclytraded reits in europe to compete gnl also says that it focuses on the strongest european markets identified by the sovereign debt ratings below as a result of the large european exposure many of gnls top tenants are located abroad as i begin to dissect the gnl portfolio i become increasingly alarmed as noted above gnl is competing with many wellknown us reits in the us but is also competing directly with its affiliated nontraded reit as well as american finance trust inc while gnl appears to be targeting most of its growth in europe the external managers are in control of sourcing new deals gnls base management fee is  percent of aum assets under management reduced by  percent for every  billion of aum above  billion to a floor of  percent gnl has capped aum fees at  percent until reaching  billion should internalize before that i hope gnl says in the investor presentation that it has access to broader real estate pipeline provided by acquisitions team structured to source deals and that the sponsors scale  employees have deep due diligence experience… what about conflicts of interest for example gnls  tenant is family dollar representing around  percent of gnls portfolio as i reviewed many of the freestanding family dollar stores owned by gnl it became clear to me that gnl has no experience managing the smaller around  sf stores while many of gnls european properties are larger industrial and office properties i question how gnl can effectively manage such a diverse business where its management team has limited experience as i studied gnls  unit portfolio it became clear to me that the public listing was the only liquidity alternative given the diverse portfolio assembled as a nontraded reit i could see no other reit or private investor willing to acquire the whole portfolio its simply a mishmash of net leased buildings scattered everywhere heres a random property conway freight in illinois how would you like to own this conway freight in uhrichsville oh population  or what about this conway freight in waite park mn population  heres my point gpt has a weighted average remaining lease term of  years sounds good what happens when the lease expires or when a tenant vacates early due to bk is there a dedicated management team that can manage the retention risk its easy to be  percent occupied when you have no track record having the best investment grade rated portfolio is not a sign that signals outperformance just take a look at chambers street below also gnl has over  percent invested in office properties that means that there will be more capex related costs in future years when leases burn off again just another risk to consider the argument that external management is better because ga costs are lower than peers is foolish lets see gnl is located at  park avenue  th floor in nyc and ar capital is also located at  park avenue in nyc translation gnl investors are paying ar capital fees to buy and sell real estate if you add the fees to gnls ga costs an intelligent investor can see that there is no bargain the balance sheet heres how gnls debt compares with the net lease peers because of gnls exposure in europe the company invests in multiple currencies usd euro and pound sterling most of gnls debt is fixedrate gnls capital stack is around  percent equity and  percent debt heres how gnl compares to similar peers another monthly dividend payer as noted gnl did not include arcp in its recent investor presentation im not sure why… perhaps it was because gnl is a similar incubator to arcp when it listed remember that arcp listed and grew into a massive consolidator that paid out monthly dividends although gnl is not run by nicholas schorsch it has close ties with its external manager ar capital in addition realty capital securities is raising equity for american realty capital global ii  an all but familiar story for arcp remember the music gnl seems to be the same song just a second verse gnl pays a monthly dividend of  per share and that translates into  per year thats  percent based on the latest share price in terms of dividend safety gnls affo payout ratio based on its  runrate is  percent while thats not a sucker yield ratio its higher than i would like to see for a newlylisted reit especially since ar capital is affiliated and externally advised gnl also has higher leverage than most peers above  percent and the company has significantly more office exposure higher capex required i dont fear a nearterm dividend cut but without a track record to rely on i cannot recommend the safety of the dividend technically gnl has no employees so i have little confidence that an investors interest are aligned remember that gnls ceo is also the ceo of american realty capital global ii heres how gnls pffo compares with the peers note i used gnls  runrate in my opinion the market is valuing gnls shares fairly i suspect that some of the selloff is related to the overall underperformance of net lease reits  down around  percent since january  however i believe a larger force behind gnls price decline has been the rush to the door sparked by other realty capital securities products while nicholas schorsch is no longer the chairman at rcs he is a shareholder and investor to the best of my knowledge so when a gnl nontraded reit investor decides to sell shares and reinvest in another nontraded reit likely because the broker suggests it one is likely paying  to  percent in fees to own shares in yet another illiquid reit setting the stage for another round of same song second verse be careful with global net lease while i see no reason to call this reit by the sucker yield name yet there are enormous conflicts that could cause unwitting investors to succumb to illogical investing tactics as frank j williams warned if you must speculate learn the rules people of he dupe are hypnotized by the glare of gold and he offered these words of wisdom an investor us one who buys sound securities where he knows his principal will be safe and he will get a fair income return on his money we all know the song by nowbe careful of the fools gold for more information durable income portfolio click here sources snl financial fast graphs and gnl investor presentation reits mentioned
