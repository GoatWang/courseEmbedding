gained momentum at the democratic convention he was nominated on the first ballot he chose senator walter f mondale of minnesota as his running mate carter campaigned hard against president gerald r ford debating with him three times carter won by  electoral votes to  for ford carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment by the end of his administration he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit measured in percentage of the gross national product unfortunately inflation and interest rates were at near record highs and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs he dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production he prompted government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries he sought to improve the environment his expansion of the national park system included protection of  million acres of alaskan lands to increase human and social services he

succeeded in obtaining ratification of the panama canal treaties building upon the work of predecessors he established full diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china and completed negotiation of the salt ii nuclear limitation treaty with the soviet union there were serious setbacks however the soviet invasion of afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the salt ii pact the seizure as hostages of the u s embassy staff in iran dominated the news during the last  months of the administration the consequences of irans holding americans captive together with continuing inflation at home contributed to carters defeat in  even then he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages iran finally released the  americans the same day carter left office

policyholders guess james s carter one of the most common questions that inhouse counsel may have for coverage counsel is “what is the effect of providing late notice of an insurance claim” the answer is that it depends on which state’s law applies to the insurance policy a minority of states view notice as a condition precedent to coverage and unexcused or unreasonably late notice voids coverage the majority of states however have adopted the noticeprejudice rule which is one of the most beneficial rules to policyholders rooted in equity and contract principles it holds that untimely notice does not waive coverage unless the insurance carrier has been materially prejudiced by the delay but a state’s adoption of the noticeprejudice rule is usually not the end of the story as the noticeprejudice rule has gained prominence insurers have shifted strategy from arguing against the adoption of the noticeprejudice rule to urging courts to carve out exceptions to the rule in which the insurer is deemed to suffer prejudice as a matter of law this strategy if successful could have the effect of eroding the protection that the noticeprejudice rule affords policyholders at a minimum it will foster uncertainty among policyholders as to whether the noticeprejudice rule will apply continue reading “what happens if your company gives late notice of a claim to its insurer hint

contract deliver the protection your company expects james s carter many companies rely on indemnification and additional insured provisions in their contracts for protection against losses arising from a contractual relationship indemnification provisions insulate the company from certain losses by requiring the other party to assume and to indemnify it against those losses additional insured provisions add another layer of protection by requiring the other party to arrange for the company to become an insured under the other party’s insurance policies ideally indemnification provisions and additional insured coverage should work together when losses occur to furnish the level of protection the company expected when it entered into the contract unless company representatives read the insurance policy that provides the additional insured coverage however they may have little idea how the additional insured coverage works a recent decision by the supreme court of texas arising out of the deepwater horizon oil spill incident illustrates how the interplay between additional insured coverage and wording in an underlying contract can operate to frustrate an additional insured’s expectations of coverage continue reading “how to make sure the indemnification and additional insured provisions in your next contract deliver the protection your company expects” share

many companies at this time of year are preparing to renew their product liability coverage which is supposed to provide security for products lawsuits  the insurance policy that a company is considering for its products liability coverage however may leave the amount of coverage for product liability losses up to chance because of an issue that arises in insurance coverage litigation particularly those involving product liability claims known as the number of “occurrences”  simply put the numberofoccurrences issue asks whether product liability claims arise from one occurrence or more than one occurrence  because the amount of coverage or any deductible is typically stated as a dollar amount “per occurrence” the answer to that question can leave a policyholder with an abundance of coverage or leave it essentially selfinsured the numberofoccurrences issue can have a particularly profound effect on insurance coverage in the product liability context because of the potential for numerous claims  if for instance a policy has a peroccurrence deductible and each product liability claim is deemed to be a separate occurrence the total amount of deductibles could exceed the total amount of coverage  alternatively if product liability claims are grouped together as one occurrence then only one deductible would have to be paid thus preserving coverage continue

learn how and when to remove this template message james c carter after an etching on copper plate by james s king copyrighted and published by charles barmore of new york born october   lancaster massachusetts us died february   aged  nationality american alma mater harvard college  harvard law school  occupation lawyer james coolidge carter  was an american lawyer a partner in the firm that eventually became carter ledyard  milburn clm which he helped found in  he helped create the the association of the bar of the city of new york biographyedit carter was born in lancaster massachusetts on october   the youngest child of a large and needy family he entered harvard college in  and graduated in  he rowed stroke oar in his class boat and was class orator at commencement joseph h choate said of him when i entered harvard college in  mr carter who had already been there for two years was a very marked man among the  students who then constituted the entire community of the little college to very commanding abilities he added untiring industry and to a lofty character most pleasing manners a combination which easily made him foremost he was filled with an honorable ambition and took all the prizes he took an interest in the public questions of the day and cultivated the art of speaking with discriminating assiduity he was a devoted admirer of mr webster    and i always thought he modeled himself upon that noble example in style in expression and in the mode of treating every question that arose indeed in his last years i regarded him as the last survivor of the websterian school carter later attended harvard law school until  he had entered the law school in  after spending a year tutoring in new york city it was during this year in new york city that he worked in the office of kent  davies where his attendance was only nominal one of the partners of kent  davies henry e davies later came to see carter at harvard law school davies told carter that the firm of kent  davies was about to be dissolved that the firm of davies  scudder would be located at  wall street and that he wanted carter to accept a position as managing clerk carter accepted the offer and shortly thereafter was admitted to the new york bar after about a year davies  scudder dissolved when davies left to become corporation counsel of the city of new york so in  at the age of  after one year of practice carter became a junior partner in scudder  carter which has under its successive organization leading to clm in the words of joseph choate “occupied a great place in the annals of the profession in new york” carter instead of deriving any special benefit from it at the outset of his career had to make his own way by dint of long hours and hard work starting with little money and no major clients carter by  had become prominent as a litigator and was being sought out by other lawyers to assist them in their cases thus he was asked by charles oconor a wellknown new york lawyer to assist him in number of cases including an action against william marcy tweed boss of tammany hall to recover funds for the city of new york david dudley field represented the defendant the preparation and trial of the case by carter and o’conor resulted in a verdict in which the city recovered over  as a result of his endeavors in the tweed case in  carter was appointed a member of governor tilden’s commission to devise a plan for the government of cities to prevent a repetition of tweed’s system the plan which the commission proposed was that the government of cities should be nonpartisan as a result it was not adopted in  carter joined with other prominent new york lawyers in establishing the association of the bar of the city of new york and he was twice president of the association first – and a second time in – as robert w gordon of stanford law school points out during the years from  to  carter was involved in many of the important movements for the reform of new york city government he was a member of the tilden commission mentioned above the antitammany committee of seventy formed by seventy members of the association of the bar to oppose tammany boss richard croker the national municipal league of which he was president in  the citizens union which he helped to found the good government clubs and the city club of new york of which carter had been its first president he was elected an associate fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  carter was also a member of the committee of one hundred actually  members organized to support a reform plan for new york city schools under carter’s leadership the bar association was also prominent in defeating david dudley field’s proposed civil code the arguments carter then framed and addressed to successive legislatures and governors led to the final rejection of the code his views were published in a series of pamphlets the first of which appeared in  under the title the proposed codification of our common law “the main theme of carter’s argument” according to george w martin “was built on a distinction he drew between ‘written’ or statutory law originated and occasionally repealed or revised by the legislature and the ‘unwritten’ or common law which was revealed by the decisions of judges” with respect to the unwritten law carter maintained that the judge’s function was “to apply the existing standard of justice carter’s emphasis to the new exhibition of fact and to do this by ascertaining the conclusion to which right reason aided by rules already established leads” that standard of justice rested on public opinion which he defined as follows and what is this but saying that law in order to be obeyed and enforced must accord with the public standard or conception of justice all well conceived efforts to make or to declare law are therefore efforts to apply this public or as we have styled it national standard of justice to human conduct this national standard more particularly stated is the final result of the moral and intellectual life and culture of a nation the product of all the influences public and private which tend to cultivate and develop men’s conceptions of what is just expedient and useful and which is unconsciously perceived and felt by every individual member of society by reason of the fact that he is such a member and exposed to like influences with his fellows in  he delivered an address before the virginia state bar association which was afterwards published under the title of the provinces of the written and unwritten law in  he addressed the american bar association on “the ideal and the actual in the law” which embodied further views on his theory of the origin of law in his later years he formulated his theories in a series of lectures which he planned to deliver at the harvard law school and which were published posthumously by his executor lewis cass ledyard in a book entitled law its origin growth and function in  he was appointed one of the counsel to present the claims of the united states before the bering sea tribunal he died in new york city on february   referencesedit
