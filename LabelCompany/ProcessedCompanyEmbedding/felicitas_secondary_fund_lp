the private equity secondary market also often called private equity secondaries or secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds given the absence of established trading markets for these interests the transfer of interests in private equity funds as well as hedge funds can be more complex and laborintensive sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors including pension funds endowments and wealthy families selling off their private equity funds before the pools have sold off all their assets for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets buyers seek to acquire private equity interests in the secondary market for multiple reasons for example the duration of the investment may be much shorter than an investment in the private equity fund initially likewise the buyer may be able to acquire these interests at an attractive price finally the buyer can evaluate the funds holdings before deciding to purchase an interest in the fund conversely sellers may seek to sell interest for various reasons including the need to raise capital the desire to avoid future capital calls the need to reduce an overallocation to the asset class or for regulatory reasons driven by strong demand for private equity exposure over the past decade a significant weasel words amount of capital has been committed to secondary market funds from

transaction space hoping to capitalize on what is perceived to be a growing market opportunity other independent advisory firms such as lp analyst have also sprung up to provide private equity investors with thirdparty analysis supporting secondary buyside and sellside transactions assessments types of secondary transactionsedit diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of fund interestsedit a common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership or llc member ownership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the fund interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund in addition to traditional cash sales sales of fund interests are consummated through a number of structured transactions  structured joint ventures  — includes a wide variety of negotiated transactions between the buyer and seller that typically is customized to the specific needs of the buyer and seller typically the buyer and seller agree on an economic arrangement that is more complex than a simple transfer of  ownership of the fund interest  securitization  — an investor contributes its fund interests into a new vehicle a collateralized fund obligation vehicle which in turn issues notes and generates partial liquidity for the seller typically the investor will also sell a portion of the equity in the leveraged vehicle also referred to as a collateralized fund obligation vehicle  stapled transactions  — commonly referred to as stapled secondaries occurs when a private equity firm the gp is raising a new fund a secondary buyer purchases an interest in an existing fund from a current investor and makes a new commitment to the new fund being raised by the gp these transactions are often initiated by private equity firms during the fundraising process they had become less and less frequent during  and  as the appetite for primary investments shrunk since  a limited number of spinout transactions have been completed involving captive teams within financial institutions sale of direct interestsedit  secondary directs or synthetic secondaries  – this category is the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions typically this category can be subdivided as follows  secondary direct  — the sale of a captive portfolio of direct investments to a secondary buyer that will either manage the investments themselves or arrange for a new manager for the investments one of the most notable examplesaccording to whom of a corporate seller engaging into a direct portfolios sale is the two consecutive sales of direct portfolios from aea technology to coller capital and vision capital in  and  respectively  synthetic secondary or spinout  — under a synthetic secondary transaction secondary investors acquire an interest in a new limited partnership that is formed specifically to hold a portfolio of direct investments typically the manager of the new fund had historically managed the assets as a captive portfolio the most notableaccording to whom example of this type of transaction is the spinout of midocean partners from deutsche bank in   tailend  — this category typically refers to the sale of the remaining assets in a private equity fund that is approaching or has exceeded its anticipated life a tailend transaction allows the manager of the fund to achieve liquidity for the funds investors  structured secondary  – this category typically refers to the structured sale of a portfolio of private equity fund interests whereby the seller keeps some or all of the fund interests on its balance sheet but the buyer agrees to fund all future capital calls of the sellers portfolio in exchange for a preferred return secured against future distributions of the sellers portfolio these type of secondary transactions have become increasingly explored since mid and throughout  as many sellers did not want to take a loss through a straight sale of their portfolio at a steep discount but instead were ready to abandon some of the future upside in exchange for a bridge of the uncalled capital commitmentscitation needed historyedit history of private equity and venture capital early history origins of modern private equity the s leveraged buyout boom the s leveraged buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e main article history of private equity and venture capital early historyedit the venture capital fund of america today vcfa group founded in  by dayton carr was likely the first investment firm to begin purchasing private equity interests in existing venture capital leveraged buyout and mezzanine funds as well as direct secondary interests in private companies early pioneers in the secondary market include jeremy coller the founder of ukbased coller capital arnaud isnard who worked with carr at vcfa and would later form arcis a secondary firm based in france as well as stanley alfeld founder of landmark partners in the years immediately following the dotcom crash many investors sought an early exit from their outstanding commitments to the private equity asset class particularly venture capital as a result the nascent secondary market became an increasingly active sector within private equity in these years secondary transaction volume increased from historical levels of  or  of private equity commitments to  of the addressable market many of the largest financial institutions eg deutsche bank abbey national ubs ag sold portfolios of direct investments and “paytoplay” funds portfolios that were typically used as a means to gain entry to lucrative leveraged finance and mergers and acquisitions assignments but had created hundreds of millions of dollars of losses  to edit the surge in activity in the secondary market between  and  prompted new entrants to the market it was during this time that the market evolved from what had previously been a relatively small niche into a functioning and important area of the private equity industry prior to  the market was still characterized by limited liquidity and distressed prices with private equity funds trading at significant discounts to fair value beginning in  and extending through  the secondary market transformed into a more efficient market in which assets for the first time traded at or above their estimated fair values and liquidity increased dramatically during these years the secondary market transitioned from a niche subcategory in which the majority of sellers were distressed to an active market with ample supply of assets and numerous market participants by  active portfolio management had become far more common in the increasingly developed secondary market and an increasing number of investors had begun to pursue secondary sales to rebalance their private equity portfolios the continued evolution of the private equity secondary market reflected the maturation and evolution of the larger private equity industry  and the credit crisisedit the secondary market for private equity interests has entered a new phase in  with the onset and acceleration of the credit crunch pricing in the market fell steadily throughout  as the supply of interests began to greatly outstrip demand and the outlook for leveraged buyout and other private equity investments worsened financial institutions including citigroup and abn amro as well as affiliates of aig and macquarie were prominent sellers with the crash in global markets from in the fall of  more sellers entered the market including publicly traded private equity vehicles endowments foundations and pension funds many sellers were facing significant overcommittments to their private equity programs and in certain cases significant unfunded commitments to new private equity funds were prompting liquidity concerns with the dramatic increase in the number of distressed sellers entering the market at the same time the pricing level in the secondary market dropped rapidly in these transactions sellers were willing to accept major discounts to current valuations typically in reference to the previous quarterly net asset value published by the underlying private equity fund manager as they faced the prospect of further asset writedowns in their existing portfolios or as they had to achieve liquidity under a limited amount of time at the same time the outlook for buyers became more uncertain and a number of prominent secondary players were slow to purchase assets in certain cases buyers that had agreed to secondary purchases began to exercise material adverse change mac clauses in their contracts to walk away from deals that they had agreed to only weeks before private equity fund managers published their december  valuations with substantial writedowns to reflect the falling value of the underlying companies as a result the discount to net asset value offered by buyers to sellers of such assets was reduced however activity in the secondary market fell dramatically from  levels as market participants continued to struggle to agree on price reflecting the gains in the public equity markets since the end of the first quarter the dynamics in the secondary market continued to evolve certain buyers that had been reluctant to invest earlier in the year began to return and nontraditional investors were more active particularly for unfunded commitments than they had been in previous years  to   post financial crisisedit since mid the secondary market has seen increased levels of activity resulting from improved pricing conditions through the middle of  the level of activity has continued to remain at elevated levels as sellers have entered the market with large portfolios the

seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of fund interestsedit a common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership or llc member ownership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the fund interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund in addition to traditional cash sales sales of fund interests are consummated through a number of structured transactions  structured joint ventures  — includes a wide variety of negotiated transactions between the buyer and seller that typically is customized to the specific needs of the buyer and seller typically the buyer and seller agree on an economic arrangement that is more complex than a simple transfer of  ownership of the fund interest  securitization  — an investor contributes its fund interests into a new vehicle a collateralized fund obligation vehicle which in turn issues notes and generates partial liquidity for the seller typically the investor will also sell a portion of the equity in the leveraged vehicle also referred to as a collateralized fund obligation vehicle  stapled transactions  — commonly referred to as stapled secondaries occurs when a private equity firm the gp is raising a new fund a secondary buyer purchases an interest in an existing fund from a current investor and makes a new commitment to the new fund being raised by the gp these transactions are often initiated by private equity firms during the fundraising process they had become less and less frequent during  and  as the appetite for primary investments shrunk since  a limited number of spinout transactions have been completed involving captive teams within financial institutions sale of direct interestsedit  secondary directs or synthetic secondaries  – this category is the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions typically this category can be subdivided as follows  secondary direct  — the sale of a captive portfolio of direct investments to a secondary buyer that will either manage the investments themselves or arrange for a new manager for the investments one of the most notable examplesaccording to whom of a corporate seller engaging into a direct portfolios sale is the two consecutive sales of direct portfolios from aea technology to coller capital and vision capital in  and  respectively  synthetic secondary or spinout  — under a synthetic secondary transaction secondary investors acquire an interest in a new limited partnership that is formed specifically to hold a portfolio of direct investments typically the manager of the new fund had historically managed the assets as a captive portfolio the most notableaccording to whom example of this type of transaction is the spinout of midocean partners from deutsche bank in   tailend  — this category typically refers to the sale of the remaining assets in a private equity fund that is approaching or has exceeded its anticipated life a tailend transaction allows the manager of the fund to achieve liquidity for the funds investors  structured secondary  – this category typically refers to the structured sale of a portfolio of private equity fund interests whereby the seller keeps some or all of the fund interests on its balance sheet but the buyer agrees to fund all future capital calls of the sellers portfolio in exchange for a preferred return secured against future distributions of the sellers portfolio these type of secondary transactions have become increasingly explored since mid and throughout  as many sellers did not want to take a loss through a straight sale of their portfolio at a steep discount but instead were ready to abandon some of the future upside in exchange for a bridge of the uncalled capital commitmentscitation needed historyedit history of private equity and venture capital early history origins of modern private equity the s leveraged buyout boom the s leveraged buyout and the venture capital bubble the s dotcom bubble to the credit crunch v t e main article history of private equity and venture capital early historyedit the venture capital fund of america today vcfa group founded in  by dayton carr was likely the first investment firm to begin purchasing private equity interests in existing venture capital leveraged buyout and mezzanine funds as well as direct secondary interests in private companies early pioneers in the secondary market include jeremy coller the founder of ukbased coller capital arnaud isnard who worked with carr at vcfa and would later form arcis a secondary firm based in france as well as stanley alfeld founder of landmark partners in the years immediately following the dotcom crash many investors sought an early exit from their outstanding commitments to the private equity asset class particularly venture capital as a result the nascent secondary market became an increasingly active sector within private equity in these years secondary transaction volume increased from historical levels of  or  of private equity commitments to  of the addressable market many of the largest financial institutions eg deutsche bank abbey national ubs ag sold portfolios of direct investments and “paytoplay” funds portfolios that were typically used

secondary market between  and  prompted new entrants to the market it was during this time that the market evolved from what had previously been a relatively small niche into a functioning and important area of the private equity industry prior to  the market was still characterized by limited liquidity and distressed prices with private equity funds trading at significant discounts to fair value beginning in  and extending through  the secondary market transformed into a more efficient market in which assets for the first time traded at or above their estimated fair values and liquidity increased dramatically during these years the secondary market transitioned from a niche subcategory in which the majority of sellers were distressed to an active market with ample supply of assets and numerous market participants by  active portfolio management had become far more common in the increasingly developed secondary market and an increasing number of investors had begun to pursue secondary sales to rebalance their private equity portfolios the continued evolution of the private equity secondary market reflected the maturation and evolution of the larger private equity industry  and the credit crisisedit the secondary market for private equity interests has entered a new phase in  with the onset and acceleration of the credit crunch pricing in the market fell steadily throughout  as the supply of interests began to greatly outstrip demand and the outlook for leveraged buyout and other private equity investments worsened financial institutions including citigroup and abn amro as well as affiliates of aig and macquarie were prominent sellers with the crash in global markets from in the fall of  more sellers entered the market including publicly traded private equity vehicles endowments foundations and pension funds many sellers were facing significant overcommittments to their private equity programs and in certain cases significant unfunded commitments to new private equity funds were prompting liquidity concerns with the dramatic increase in the number of distressed sellers entering the market at the same time the pricing level in the secondary market dropped rapidly in these transactions sellers were willing to accept major discounts to current valuations typically in reference to the previous quarterly net asset value published by the underlying private equity fund manager as they faced the prospect of further asset writedowns in their existing portfolios or as they had to achieve liquidity under a limited amount of time at the same time the outlook for buyers became more uncertain and a number of prominent secondary players were slow to purchase assets in certain cases buyers that had agreed to secondary purchases began to exercise material adverse change mac clauses in their contracts to walk away from deals that they had agreed to only weeks before private equity fund managers published their december  valuations with substantial writedowns to reflect the falling value of the underlying companies as a result the discount to net asset value offered by buyers to sellers of such assets was reduced however activity in the secondary market fell dramatically from  levels as market participants continued to struggle to agree on price reflecting the gains in the public equity markets since the end of the first quarter the dynamics in the secondary market continued to evolve certain buyers that had been reluctant to invest earlier in the year began to return and nontraditional investors were more active particularly for unfunded commitments than they had been in previous years  to   post financial crisisedit since mid the secondary market has seen increased levels of activity resulting from improved pricing

often called private equity secondaries or secondaries refers to the buying and selling of preexisting investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds given the absence of established trading markets for these interests the transfer of interests in private equity funds as well as hedge funds can be more complex and laborintensive sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds by its nature the private equity asset class is illiquid intended to be a longterm investment for buyandhold investors including pension funds endowments and wealthy families selling off their private equity funds before the pools have sold off all their assets for the vast majority of private equity investments there is no listed public market however there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets buyers seek to acquire private equity interests in the secondary market for multiple reasons for example the duration of the investment may be much shorter than an investment in the private equity fund initially likewise the buyer may be able to acquire these interests at an attractive price finally the buyer can evaluate the funds holdings before deciding to purchase an interest in the fund conversely sellers may seek to sell interest for various reasons including the need to raise capital the desire to avoid future capital calls the need to reduce an overallocation to the asset class or for regulatory reasons driven by strong demand for private equity exposure over the past decade a significant weasel words amount of capital has been committed to secondary market funds from investors looking to increase and

dedicated boutique firms eg tullett prebon alternative investments cebile capital llp and setter capital inc electronic exchanges eg secondmarket social network eg secondarylink as well as established

perceived to be a growing market opportunity other independent advisory firms such as lp analyst have also sprung up to provide private equity investors with thirdparty analysis supporting secondary buyside and sellside transactions assessments types of secondary transactionsedit diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest the buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories sale of fund interestsedit a common secondary transaction this category includes the sale of an investors interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investors limited partnership or llc member ownership interest in the funds nearly all types of private equity funds eg including buyout growth equity venture capital mezzanine distressed and real estate can be sold in the secondary market the transfer of the fund interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund in addition to traditional cash sales sales of fund interests are consummated through a number of structured transactions  structured joint ventures  — includes a wide variety of negotiated transactions between the buyer and seller that typically is customized to the specific needs of the buyer and seller typically the buyer and seller agree on an economic arrangement that is more complex than a simple transfer of  ownership of the fund interest  securitization  — an investor contributes its fund interests into a new vehicle a collateralized fund obligation vehicle which in turn issues notes and generates partial liquidity for the seller typically the investor will also sell a portion of the equity in the leveraged vehicle also referred to as a collateralized fund obligation vehicle  stapled transactions  — commonly referred to as stapled secondaries occurs when a private equity firm the gp is raising a new fund a secondary buyer purchases an interest in an existing fund from a current investor and makes a new commitment to the new fund being raised by the gp these transactions are often initiated by private equity firms during the fundraising process they had become less and less frequent during  and  as the appetite for primary investments shrunk since  a limited number of spinout transactions have been completed involving captive teams within financial institutions sale of direct interestsedit  secondary directs or synthetic secondaries  – this category is the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds these portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions typically this category can be subdivided as follows  secondary direct  — the sale of a captive portfolio of direct investments to a secondary buyer that will either manage the investments themselves or arrange for a new manager for the investments one of the most notable examplesaccording to whom of a corporate seller engaging into a direct portfolios sale is the two consecutive sales of direct portfolios from aea technology to coller capital and vision capital in  and  respectively  synthetic secondary or spinout  — under a synthetic secondary transaction secondary investors acquire an interest in a new limited partnership that is formed specifically to hold a portfolio of direct investments typically the manager of the new fund had historically managed the assets as a captive portfolio the most notableaccording to whom example of this type of transaction is the spinout of midocean partners from deutsche bank in   tailend  — this category typically refers to the sale of the remaining assets in a private equity fund that is approaching or has exceeded its anticipated life a tailend transaction allows the manager of the fund to achieve liquidity for the funds investors  structured secondary  – this category typically refers to the structured sale of a portfolio of private equity fund interests whereby the seller keeps some or all of the fund interests on its balance sheet but the buyer agrees to fund all future capital calls of the sellers portfolio in exchange for a preferred return secured against future distributions of the sellers portfolio these type of secondary transactions have become increasingly explored since mid and throughout  as many sellers did not want to take a loss through a straight sale of their portfolio at a steep discount but instead were ready to abandon some of the future upside in exchange for a bridge of the uncalled capital commitmentscitation needed historyedit history of private equity and venture capital early history origins

private debt at ardian said “the global market for secondary fund of funds is in robust health and we have clear sight of a strong pipeline of quality investing opportunities we are seeing a greater diversification of sellers in the market financial institutions still hold large portfolios and continue to represent a very large source of deal flow however we are seeing an uptick from pension funds endowments and insurance companies as they seek to rebalance their portfolio while increasing their allocation to private equity” ardian drawing on its heritage as axa private equity has been
