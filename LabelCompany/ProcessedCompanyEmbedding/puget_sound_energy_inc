chakras outside the physical body it helps you bring that which you are working on in the astral and higher bodies into the foreground and allows you to dissolve blocks that may be preventing higher consciousness focus your intention on opening your rd chakra and allow the healing vibrations to bring forth new energies other observations about this bowlthere are many theories about the existence of the lost continent of lemuria was it in fact an ancient continent that stretched from the hawaiian islands to fiji and from easter island to the marianas was lemuria the lost civilization responsible for the mysterious stone monuments of easter island or is lemuria merely a metaphor that illustrates creation and destruction in relation to the first stirrings of human awareness author james churchward writes about lemuria also referred to as mu in his book “cosmic forces of mu” he describes these cosmic forces as “those which make changes in the position of bodies and sometimes change the body itself no body or matter however infinitesimally small or ponderously large can make any change without the aid of a force” the lemurian seed crystal singing bowl is the vector for that force it resonates with the power of change and creation please note that although the bowl appears to have color this is an artificial effect that is intended to show the texture of the bowl this unique bowl is clear quartz with lemurian seed crystal both incorporated within the bowl structure and fused to the outside this creates a very distinct texture that is difficult to show clear crystal on a clear bowl in photographs make note that this bowl is indeed clear to opaque quartz and as such is inherently colorless in reality  although the image shows multiple items this is for

allow the healing vibrations to bring forth new energies other observations about this bowlthere are many theories about the existence of the lost continent of lemuria was it in fact an ancient continent that stretched from the hawaiian islands to fiji and from easter island to the marianas was lemuria the lost civilization responsible for the mysterious stone monuments of easter island or is lemuria merely a metaphor that illustrates creation and destruction in relation to the first stirrings of human awareness author james churchward writes about lemuria also referred to as mu in his book “cosmic forces of mu” he describes these cosmic forces as “those which make changes in the position of bodies and sometimes change the body itself no body or matter however infinitesimally small or ponderously large can make any change without the aid of a force” the lemurian seed crystal singing bowl is the vector for that force it resonates with the power of change and creation please note that although the bowl appears to have color this is an artificial effect that is intended to show the texture of the bowl this unique bowl is clear quartz with lemurian seed crystal both incorporated within the bowl structure and fused to the outside this creates a very distinct texture that is difficult to show clear crystal on a clear bowl in photographs make note that this bowl is indeed clear to opaque quartz and as such is inherently colorless in reality  although the image shows multiple items this is for only one each crystal tones™ bowl is unique in look we will soon have a photograph

consciousness focus your intention on opening your rd chakra and allow the healing vibrations to bring forth new energies other observations about this bowlthere are many theories about the existence of the lost continent of lemuria was it in fact an ancient continent that stretched from the hawaiian islands to fiji and from easter island to the marianas was lemuria the lost civilization responsible for the mysterious stone monuments of easter island or is lemuria merely a metaphor that illustrates creation and destruction in relation to the first stirrings of human awareness author james churchward writes about lemuria also referred to as mu in his book “cosmic forces of mu” he describes these cosmic forces as “those which make changes in the position of bodies and sometimes change the body itself no body or matter however infinitesimally small or ponderously large can make any change without the aid of a force” the lemurian seed crystal singing bowl is the vector for that force it resonates with the power of change and creation please note that although the bowl appears to have color this is an artificial effect that is intended to show the texture of the bowl this unique bowl is clear quartz with lemurian seed crystal both incorporated within the bowl structure and fused to the outside this creates a very distinct texture that is difficult to show clear crystal on a clear bowl in photographs make note that this bowl is indeed clear to opaque quartz and as such is inherently colorless in reality  although the image shows multiple items this is for
