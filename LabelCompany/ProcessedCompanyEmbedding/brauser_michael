with m cash into temporarily inflated m shellchairman brausers biography has “interesting” omissions including bankruptcy wipeout and fraud lawsuits with equifax suing him alleging “fraudulent misrepresentations” with softbank lawsuit alleging various fraudsidi stock temporarily inflated from extensive yahoo message board stockpumping scheme touting idi across dozens of boards with interconnected aliases similar to halted and bankrupt fnrgidi’s transunion lawsuit could mean instant  for stock as idi future apparently based on ip they don’t own which transunion acquired when idi cso poulsens last company went bankruptconfluence of temporary factors above have inflated idi stock to the obviously unsustainable valuation of m or x revenue creating imminent  downside in best case scenarioi believe idi inc idi is another worthless brauser and honig wipeout this famous wipeout team has joined forces to temporarily resuscitate a fraud ridden shell with a tiny debt collections firm acquired with m cash payment to the unsustainable valuation of m or x revenue in what appears a desperate attempt to salvage his failed fraud shell frost has clearly gotten involved with the wrong crowd and regrettably stained his reputation through association with what i believe is one of the worst penny stock wipeout teams in america brausers biography conveniently forgets to include a long track record of fraud lawsuits bankruptcy and shareholder wipeouts while touting involvement in naviant brauser neglects to mention he was apparently sued by data fusion giant equifax nyseefx for allegations including fictitious receivables and by softbank for various frauds with apparent multimillion dollar payments to equifax shockingly the naviant debacle barely scratches the surface and barry honigs background looks even worse picture credit idi idi faces an insurmountable lawsuit while desperate for cash and with a m equity shelf filed idi stock is now coincidentally being pumped with an apparent sketchy online yahoo message board stock promotion campaign similar to halted and bankrupt forcefield energy nasdaqfnrg where the chairman was arrested for fraud idi is eerily similar to the bvsn vnrg usel izea and drne wipeouts these people oversaw with a huge amount of idi shares becoming unlocked soon a m shelf filed for idi stock sales and an abusive m virtually free rsu payment to brauser and honig idi is at imminent risk of total wipeout its not often you get to short a cash burning penny stock wipeout team with a declining m cash acquisition trading at x revenue for  cost to borrow i recommend you pour yourself a tall glass of gilbys vodka and sit down as what you read will be shocking… interactive data a tiny struggling debt collections business with  rd spending bought with m cash now that idi has officially announced they are winding down the china billboard business with huge write offs  of idis ongoing business will be interactive data llc i think idi investors are confused and dont understand what this business actually is interactive data llc is the business idi is pinning their data fusion hypestory on which idi just acquired last year with a m cash payment strip away the hype we see interactive data llc is a tiny firm with just  full time employees founded in  based in georgia interactive data seems focused on providing contact information verification to the debt collection business when a debt collector calls a defaulted creditor they are not allowed to harass people with similar names and face severe lawsuits if they make that mistake therefore debt collections agencies pay tiny amounts for some very basic offerings which allow them to be sure they are tracking down the correct person picture credit the contact verification business is a brutally competitive business where over the years interactive data finds itself facing larger superior competitors with cheaper better products and dominant sales teams due to this interactive data has struggled and been apparently forced to hire outside sales consultants and based on their transactional pricing model chase after the smallest and least profitable customers in the industry furthermore i believe interactive data isnt even a real technology company anyway because this tiny business seems to have been built largely by acquisition with no rd in   and apparently  as well we can see interactive datas financial struggling below in the only clear interactive data financials i could find available here picture credit idi inc filings we can see interactive datas  revenue declined  versus last year while gross profit fell  also interesting interactive data claims to have spent zero on rd in most of   and  and even with this expense at  and without public company expenses or any of the other sga brauserhonigetc are layering on this tiny failure it only generated a k in profit which also declined  from the previous year considering idi has already opened multiple branches in fl and wa with  engineers and the typical k of annual cash cost just to be a public company i estimate idis cash burn in the future will be at least m per quarter perhaps this is why none of idi incs press releases include the financials of this tiny struggling business they just acquired clearly the above business is worth nothing vaguely close to idis current m market cap recall that there is nothing else here the only aspect to idis business is this tiny marginally profitable and extremely competitive company thats it so what are brauser and honig doing with a fraud ridden shell and this tiny struggling debt collection firm let us dig deeper to understand what is truly going on here… brausers selective disclosures  fraud lawsuits bankruptcy and wipeout as a reminder michael brauser barry honig and their investment vehicle marlin are clearly the financial architects of idi to me and i dont see how idi would even exist without them michael brauser history of fraud lawsuits bankruptcy and wipeout picture credit idi inc brauser seems to selectively tout his background picking and choosing certain companies while failing to transparently disclose lawsuits around his involvement with other companies a large number of these undisclosed companies wiped out big piles of retail shareholders naviant  fraud allegations picture credit naviant for instance brauser touts his naviant track record sale with equifax in his biography what seems to have been forgotten though is he was apparently sued by equifax for fraud allegations over that transaction and apparently saw millions of dollars go to equifax as a result this amazing lawsuit alleges brauser participated in the fraudulent creation of fictitious receivables and further participated in accounting overstatments that disguised naviants true financial condition going on to allege further maintained one set of book for naviant that was more accurate and complete and another that omitted the lowpriced email transaction which naviant provided to equifax and its accountants during merger negotiations shareholder softbank also apparently sued claiming defendant michael brauser had been intimately involved in carrying out various frauds at naviant and covering up their misdeeds through threats and intimidation softbank also claims that defendant michael brauser represented to softbank that he was judgment proof as a result of transferring away all of his personal assets with the exception of his bentley automobile and personal computer while the equifax fraud allegations seem to have resulted in big cash payments its not clear to me how the softbank suit ended unfortunately though it appears this naviant mess is just the tip of the iceberg… biozone this is not even investment  it is stealing brauser was again sued with honig etc in a case involving biozone pharmaceutical including emphasis mine an illegal scheme by a group of predatory investors utilizing facially despicable methods and goes on to explain that in addition to allegations involving violations of federal securities laws this group of investors misled plaintiff fisher through an investment scheme designed to divest plaintiff of all the economic rights and goodwill be had built through his company over the course of the previous  years the defendants brauser honig etc immediate financial motivation in taking a legitimate economic contributor is to turn it into an investment vehicle in which they will pump up the stock price and then proceed to sell off the shares without regard to the well being of the business violating the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act for engaging in a pattern of similar behavior against other companies this lawsuit is remarkable and i strongly encourage you read it this case seems to have also been shuffled around so its not clear what the ultimate resolution was for poor daniel fisher however with all the honig brauser etc lawsuits i would strongly recommend everyone read all the legal background documents to make sure you truly understand what you are getting yourself into with these people unsurprisingly biozone seems to have been a wipeout for original investors as the stock imploded  over the time frame below and was sued for breach of fiduciary duty after basically all of biozones important assets were transferred to another honigbrauser company i remind you that frost was also somehow convinced to invest in this mess too the list goes on even moar alleged misrepresentations and bankruptcy brauser was allegedly sued again  for fraud in kast vs the tube media corp  a publicly traded company that apparently also failed was delisted and seems to have ceased operations allegations included filing materially false and misleading financial reports and intentionally making misrepresentations of material facts also not discussed in brausers biography was the apparent bankruptcy of fl telephone co or that brauser was allegedly sued in an adversary proceeding related to that bankruptcy murky situations abound with further allegations of improper side deals and brauser potentially plotting to violate fl law through undisclosed m commission payments despite all these red flags retail investors seem to fall for the brauser and honig show over and over again as yet another lawsuit here against brauser as chairman of sendtec alleges violations of securities laws while some of these lawsuits seem to have resulted in cash payments like equifax other lawsuits seem to have eventually been dismissed or possibly settled so i recommend you read these legal documents yourself to gain the full picture regardless though investing with anyone who has repeatedly faced such serious allegations clearly warrants extreme caution furthermore just because you invest in a company and own shares of equity does not make you a founder as much as youd like if i own coca kola nyseko stock for years that doesnt mean im a founder and even if i sit in on four phone calls per year with the board that obviously doesnt mean i built the business either confused retail stock investors like to tout but he sold interclick while ignoring the fact that being on the board is a passive role merely requiring a few meetings a year iclk traded at  before it was eventually sold for  that means many shareholders took a severe loss and the company was actually sold at a discount to where it had traded previously interclick sometimes even when you win…you lose brauser seems to love to tout that he was on the board of interclick when it was sold to yahoo yhoo as you see above though before yahoo stepped into salvage this mess interclick was also on its way to being another wipeout even with yahoo buying the company at a premium and the deal apparently failing later on the takeout price was still  from where it had traded previously so i see that even in the blind chance brauser accidentally doesnt wipe a company out or get sued with fraud allegations in the biggest success of his whole life many shareholders still lost a substantial part of their investment for brausers more recent forays into stocks as well as virtually everything he touches bad things seem to happen to retail investors… the honig  brauser playbook frosts name thrown around then shareholders get wiped out unsophisticated retail investors seem to think frosts name on a filing means an investment is a sure thing ignoring the fact that frost is  years old and has money in dozens and dozens of investments unfortunately it seems the financial contamination of honig and brauser involvement more than overwhelms any limited positive benefit from a claimed frost connection best i can tell the end result is shareholder wipeout lawsuits or bankruptcy in almost every instance it seems to me frost has gotten mixed up with the wrong guys and while investing in a company that only frost is involved in may be worth considering the moment honig or brauser pop up i think you should basically just light your wallet on fire and get it over with with so many people involved in the following wipeouts the timeframes are messy as a result the  decline estimates and charts in this report are all my best estimate of the best time frame to represent the impact of these people on the companies in question aside from idi inc where tiger media was already found to involve fraud there are countless examples of this teams wipeouts like vpco where frost name was again touted with absurdly promotional articles while brauser and honig were also involved and apparently scott frohman who seems to have some past tie to brausers muchtouted seisant also with some very questionable stuff going on was also involved none of that mattered though as vapor corp nasdaqvpco and the  retail shareholder base have experienced a  disaster so far and usellcom which seems to have had honig brauser with current idi board members peter t benz and idi director daniel brauser usellcoms ceo all involved despite positive seekingalpha articles and frosts public involvement it essentially went straight to  falling  and wiping out anyone unfortunate enough to have invested frosts name was again touted with promotional articles from curious authors about izea barry honig and brauser were also involved it seems and with a  retail shareholders base now sports a m market cap as otc listed izea inc otcizea which has been a disaster for everyone over any time frame with  wipeout or vringo vrng which had frost brauser and honig all involved but apparently honigbrauser again offset even frosts genius as the  retail shareholder based enjoyed a quick  decline with no recovery i believe these people have done this over and over again how about document security systems nysemktdss which i estimate has  retail shareholders who have also enjoyed a quick  wipeout frost has been involved in plenty of wipeouts so the list goes on like noninvasive monitoring systems inc otcpknimu where frost was involved and the  retail shareholder base only lost  so far  be patient or anfield resources nyseary  wipeout or mslp where shareholders have had a volatile ride to a  loss or bullfrog otcqbbfgc which with a  retail shareholder base seems on its way to  with a  decline already or fuse sciences otcpkdrop which honig and brauser seem to have convinced frost to invest in unfortunately through mslp in  this seems to have gone to  with a  decline showing or perhaps silver horn mining with brauser honig and frost all involved which then seems to have become gwstt and then trkk but basically wiped everyone out on the way to an m market cap with another swift  decline drone aviation otcqbdrne is another good and recent example where frosts name was touted the notorious redchip was then apparently paid hundreds of thousands of trading shares and cash for their promotion along with current idi board member steven rubin involvement drne has an absolutely egregious  retail shareholder base who have now been wiped out with a  decline so far michael brauser parties with nelly retail shareholders get wiped out picture credit as longterm readers of mine know i am a huge nelly fan for those of you who dont click the links in my articles you should that said though i like oldies too so n that note i would like to dedicate a song to the honigbrauser gang picture credit quoting directly from the songs lyrics hahahahahahahahahahahahaa wipeout theres not much else to say about that barry honig lawsuits even more wipeouts and curious promotional stock articles in case the pages of horrific red flags above are not enough to cause concern coincidently many barry honig names also seem to garner curiously promotional seekingalpha articles before the stock eventually gets wiped out as outlined in bleecker streets impressive piece of research there are many questionable ties between barry honig and promotional stock report authors picture credit bleecker street similar to brauser honig has been named in lawsuits regarding everything from alleged violations of securities laws to situations involving unjust enrichment alleged forgery and a brutal beating involving professional boxer briggs and honigs empire sports while im not sure what confidential settlements lawsuit losses or wins may have resulted the pattern here is clearly startling dont let this happen to you strangely honigs boxing disaster empire sports seems to have ultimately became sagebrush gold nasdaqsage on  and then after announcing involvement of dr phillip frost the company then changed name to pershing gold nasdaqpglc in march  and has been a total disaster for shareholders since these guys got involved despite frost involvement and lots of promotional seekingalpha articles by authors who disclose zero pglc stock ownership pershing gold declined  or this other honig wipeout spherix inc nasdaqspex  decline as you can see investing in anything with brauser or honig involved even when frost is named somewhere in the filings is typically a total disaster for poor retail sharebagholders its not just brauser and honig though idi incs cso ole poulsen coo james reilly and ceo derek dubner all seem to forget to include the fact that their last company tlo went bankrupt and nearly wiped out shareholders completely there are countless other honigbrauser disasters and i am getting tired of going through all their wipeouts i think you get the point already so in the interest of time i will pose one serious question of all the brauserhonigmarlin stocks in the market today how many have market caps m or generate m in profit per year given idi true market cap is currently m this is a serious question if anyone can find a single current brauserhonigmarlin stock with a m market cap or one consistently generating m per year of profit i will video tape myself personally singing you a song on youtube not joking whats in idi for brauser and honig m free idi shares worth over m now that you may understand what is truly going on here lets look at how honig and brauser get rich in this scheme and why i believe they are involved the most egregious part of this whole idi debacle to me are the crazy and what i view as clearly abusive contracts honig and brauser are mistreating idi shareholders with via their marlin vehicle for example regardless of how much dilutive equity it may take what business is acquired or at what stock price it seems to me brauserhonigmarlin basically get m idi shares essentially for free with some offensively low hurdles and loose terms set for their payday the marlin consulting agreement provides for equity compensation issued to marlin in the amount of  restricted stock units rsus of tbo which shall vest in four  equal annual increments beginning october   and ending october   provided that one of the milestones as hereinafter defined has been achieved on or before such date and subject to marlin capital providing services on each applicable vesting date as used in the marlin consulting agreement milestone means i tbo generating  million in revenues over any  month period or ii tbo generating  million in revenues over any  month period and generating positive earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization with all stock based compensation not included as an expense for such  month period  i would note there is a clear lack of any per share measurements and shockingly dilutive stock compensation to insiders is specifically excluded from this whole mess with such low hurdles set for honigbrausermarlin to rich how can anyone view this is anything other than a basically free huge rsu payday to them even more offensive to me michael brauser has apparently already received k shares of idi stock rsu for what i view as basically nothing i estimate this is worth m today on october   the board of directors approved the issuance of  rsus to two consultants one of the consultants to receive  rsus is michael brauser even worse it seems that part of this plan from the start was to get it all going with a ton of cheap stock given to their group at what i view as unreasonably favorable terms on december   tbo sold  shares of tbo common stock to various investors at  per share on a best efforts basis for an aggregate of  in net proceeds after deducting discounts and expenses whatever associates of the brauser and honig gang may have participated in this insane capital raise they seem to me to have received m of idi stock at split adjusted  per share right before a message board tout campaign started what a coincidence now with idi at  per share they are sitting on huge gain in a company that was just acquired with a m cash payment but now temporarily trades for a m valuation picture credit so while primarily retail shareholders in idi get led to what i believe is a likely financial wipeout brauser honig and marlin are set to get a free payday of m how is that possibly seem fair idi inc partnered with palladium capital advisors llc named defendant in madoff lawsuit you can tell a lot about the quality of a stock or company by the quality of the investors it is able to attract real businesses that honestly have a bright future have no problem attracting high quality vc investors or other reputable financial partners while questionable shells on their way to wipeout often struggle and are forced to take bottom tier money at loan shark terms idi inc lists palladium capital advisors as a placement agent for tbo in  who received warrant for k shares at  for their help in addition to k in cash a quick google on this curious financial partner apparently turns up a palladium capital advisors as a named defendant in a madoff ponzi lawsuit as recipients of stolen customer property and other proceeds of the illegal scheme unless this is just a name coincidence i am alarmed it is not clear to me what happened here as the lawsuit is complex and long so ill leave the reading on this to you but if idi was actually forced to partner with a named defendant allegedly involved in the madoff ponzi legal debacle that is very scary stuff indeed but wait you also get moar lawsuits spam email pump  dumps and shareholder wipeouts while honig and brauser are apparently just the leaders of this crew there are many others equally as bad idi director peter t benz seems to have been previously named in lawsuit along with bicoastal consulting group and jonathan lebed alleging fraud market manipulation stated halfway throug first paragraph unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentations in the warning management services case robert n fried was also sued at searchmedia where he was cochairman postmerger and ceo of ideation the lawsuit alleges revenues had been massively overstated due to flagrant accounting irregularities involving fictitious business transactions interestingly idi is also covered by gilford securities gilford also has a checkered past including gregg m berger former gilford broker who pled guilty and was jailed for involvement in pump and dump schemes apparently using spam emails involving thinly traded stocks to generate more than m of illegal proceeds it also appears gilford was fined k by finra recently for failing to disclose the research analyst received compensation furthermore it appears the sec fined gilford securities k for failing to properly supervise the broker who served vancouver spam promoter john hui and the firm which allegedly facilitated a m pump and dump scheme the sec also went on to allege gilford allowed employees to improperly execute customer orders without requisite trading licenses and violating regulation sp by sharing nonpublic customer information with unauthorized third parties idi incs message board stock promotion campaign similar to disgraced halted and bankrupt fnrg how has idi stock been temporarily pumped up to this obviously unsustainable valuation idi is currently being supported by one of the most widespread and extensive online message board tout campaigns i have ever seen as a reminder fnrg experienced something similar but far less egregious than idi before fnrgs chairman was arrested for fraud and the company went bankrupt the strategy for these posters is to seek out companies whose share price has risen strongly and which are getting a lot of attention the posters then seek to draw readers attention to forcefield some small portion of the readers end up buying into forcefield elevating share price and volume surprisingly this strategy can work if there are thousands of postings to other high performing and high interest stocks similarly on the yahoo message boards for example we see countless yahoo ids recently created which only tout idi across the message boards in huge volume tellingly though their promotion campaign doesnt take place on idis board presumably since anyone on the idi board already knows about idi stock and is not a useful target i think the goal here is obvious to lure in unsuspecting retail investors into idi stock and temporarily inflate the stock price for example we can see username ermelindarqkabergerc joined yahoo on  and then immediately began posting comments across unrelated boards often times literally within seconds of the last comment from yahoo message boards similar to fnrg touts posting on high traffic stocks we see idi touts posting repeatedly on the alibaba message board which clearly has zero to do with idi a simple google keyword search shows idi touts flooding message boards with an apparent target of the highest trafficked and unrelated yahoo message boards including coca cola  kinder morgan nysekmi ipath sp vix etn nysearcavxx extr fitb plnr cnet ltre hum and bby among many others we can also see this tout campaign appears coordinated as we are seeing different aliases post identical promotional messages on idi among the many idi tout aliases i have found just on the yahoo message boards include ermelindarqkabergec kennedyfettigovo auroreparagasgql kassikontoseta euniceewelluip fidelatimothycyd dellamlcurtneruts arnettexvschiffelbeintqo and likely many others to be clear i am not certain exactly who the individuals are by name behind this shady online tout campaign although i have my guesses however i dont see how anyone would do this kind of extensive and premeditated work for free and typically stock promotion is not done without compensation idi shareholder base is essentially all retail where are the credible real investors given this horrific penny stock wipeout team and yahoo message board tout campaign it is not surprising to me idis shareholder base is mostly retail in fact the only institutional investor involved of note is frost  through the original failed tiger media investment if you exclude insiders who didnt buy their shares on the open market and frost who is involved through a failed investment in a fraud idi inc is held almost entirely by unsophisticated retail owners there are no real institutions of any worth involved in idi other than a few random etfindex followers resulting from idis inclusion in the microcap etf picture credit capiq why doesnt any real investment firm want any part of idi picture credit me transunion lawsuit renders idi a zero immediately anyway what idis retail shareholders need to understand is that this lawsuit is devastating to idis desperate technology claims which in part support idis temporarily inflated stock price i think this lawsuit between idi and transunion is one of the most clear cut lawsuits ive ever seen and i believe idi will obviously lose the tlo ip in this lawsuit took tlo  years and m to develop with a huge team when idi loses this lawsuit and any claim to the ip there is simply no way this tiny fraud ridden shell company has any hope of recreating it therefore once idi loses this lawsuit the only technology left will be some tiny debt collections company that has been struggling since  and apparently spends  on rd furthermore now that transunion is embroiled in idis technology and business i think if idi makes any technology claims in the future transunion will respond with swift and endless litigation claims claiming any new idi products are based on prior art and transunions ip furthermore brausers federal fraud litigation with equifax and egregious lawsuit with transunion clearly renders both of those companies off limits to idi in the data industry i see no way any company can be successful if they are black listed from having any dealings with those two juggernauts let alone the fact that transunion seems intent on destroying idi and if you read the court documents i believe you will see as i did the transuniontlo team feels offended personally by all of this pic credit transunions tlo all the documents from the transunion litigation against brauer and idi are free and publicly available here and i especially recommend reading the complaint and any transcripts in the interest of time i will not go into detail and recommend you read up on this yourself i will give you my quicksummary read on it though which is once transunion tried to enforce their noncompete agreements against idi employees alleged to have violated them brauser allegedly tried to extort transunion over claimed license fees due based on ip which transunion already purchased in the tlo bankruptcy auction the lawsuit centers around bolt code which is code written in bolt that scans across data sets this is a common code and any multiple data base tool like lexis nexis or others have something like this the other contested ip is the bparser code which converts the bolt code to c universal programming language this is one of the most direct and obvious lawsuits ive ever seen because comically both of these pieces of ip appears expressly explained and spelled out to me in the  asset sale documents transunion and tlo participated in i think there is  chance that idi loses this resoundingly for example check out the express and direct description of the assets sold in bankruptcy as cited in doc  filed  to the extent that ole poulsen holds or asserts any interests of any kind in the bparser code converter software used or useful by the debtor in the conduct of the business the bparser code or any other business assets such bparser code and other business asset shall be deemed an acquired asset and may be sold to the buyer free and clear of all such interests… furthermore brauser and idi ceo derek dubner were intimately involved in the bankruptcy auction as transunion states they served the sales order on both brauser and derek dubner as well as interactive data while after the close of the sale poulsen and brauser both had extensive ongoing involvement with the case concerning division of sale proceeds lastly all of this ip appears to have been created using tlo hardware stored on tlos servers and used  tlo programmers even poulsen was a full time employee of tlo at the time working on the ip and was paid by tlo and then by transunion for this and his home was even paid for by tlo so any claims ip developed at home are his seems worthless as well none of this even matters much anyway as transunions tloxp is a dominant competing product that is cheaper and with more functionality than anything idi can offer if you call tlo their sales people will be happy to explain all the reasons they are superior to anyone else and even if they were in fact inferior they arent transunions enormous global sales force would steamroll anyone stupid enough to confront them if tlo wasnt superior then why would brauser try to buy them before and get sucked into this impossible lawsuit over the ip tlo and transunion are far cheaper too as they offer in depth reporting tools with all you can eat pricing for  a month for small lowvolume customers who prefer transactional pricing tlos superior service costs  per search making idis quoted average price of  per transaction a full  more expensive than tlo this makes idi incs desperate product offerings not just hopelessly behind the curve but simultaneously too expensive to be competitive i dont see how transunion doesnt just eat them alive over time idi board of directors it gets even worse… its not just brauser and honig though basically everyone involved in this company is tied to financial disasters you may think these people are protecting your best interest but for example take board member steven rubin who is apparently involved in mabvax therapeutics holdings otcqbmbvx swift  wipeout and it seems kidville as well otcpkkvil  disaster and one of the best ones he is involved in noninvasive monitoring systems inc has been crazy volatile and is only down  at the moment the list is nearly endless so i wont keep going much longer but look at sevion therapeutics otcqbsvon now  already despite raging biotech bull market and tiger x medical otcpkcdom which is now down  another example is idi board member robert swayman briefly involved in vapor corp along with honig and brauser which has unsurprisingly been a complete disaster vapor corp  stock decline to date all charts from capiq with everything youve read are these really people you want to invest with are you honestly unable to find a single better company in the world run by better people to invest in idi inc management response since idi inc has been active in promoting themselves to investors it is not hard to meet them i spoke with them not long ago but found their responses to issues raised to be underwhelming and disappointing instead of offering a clear picture of the current business i found them to offer excessively promotional claims to tam size and other vague claims in response to questions regarding management quality they claim idi to be founded by the people who started the data fusion industry however i believe the real genius leader of that hank asher passed away quite some time ago now and the last company these current people were involved in went bankrupt and nearly wiped out equity holders completely i dont see how this is reassuring furthermore it seems to me their sales and technology strategy is just throw money at it and i dont see how they can possibly compete against sales and technology beasts like transunion idi claims the lawsuit is irrelevant however i think the documents point to a different view while claims of litigation irrelevance ignore the reality i see which is that transunion seems intent on crushing idi and wiping them out completely considering any future for idi is based on technology i dont see how transunion contesting their ip claims likely forever is anything other than disastrous idi inc catalyst heinous m equity shelf wall of dilution as shares become unlocked for sale what is rare with idi is the clear and identifiable catalysts to collapse the share price primarily idi just filed an absolutely heinous shelf offering for the sale of m worth of idi stock considering idis total market cap is m this alone could wipeout current idi shareholders it gets better though as we have a huge amount of idi inc shares becoming unlocked very soon if you read the lockup agreement there is no date next to the signature but we know the shares are locked up for  year starting sometime late  or early  this means that soon a wall of shares become unlocked for sale for a company trading at x revenue and i think they will sell aggressively if they are smart idi inc  desperate for cash dilutive secondary offering imminent idi also seems desperately low on cash as we see here in  where idi claims they have enough cash to survive  months however idis cash burn has ramped up and the shutdown of the chinese billboard business will cost at least m in cash to shut down while we are now nearly  months into  this means idi will have to raise cash within the next  months and given companies rarely wait until their cash account is literally  i believe investors should expect another dilutive idi capital raise sometime in the next  months this seems like a lot of simultaneous wipeoutcatalysts occurring very soon idi incs auditor deficiencies and inability to file sec filings on time considering brauser was sued by transunion for alleged involvement in falsifying statements it makes me horrified to see what i believe are signs of idi internal accounting integrity questions for example of the two q and k filings idi inc has been required to file since they became idi inc a full  of those have been filed late the  k and the q q one of these q filings seems to have been given to investors accidentally before idi incs auditor was able to properly review it even more worrisome idi inc has curiously changed its auditor to rbsm llp who in  was just recently found by the pcaob to apparently have audit deficiencies and failure to perform sufficient procedures to evaluate the presentation of certain revenue this does not appear to have been an isolated incident either as this  inspection followed up an even worse  pcaob inspection where rbsm had audit deficiencies including a deficiency of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the firm did not obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the issuers financial statements idi incs stated market cap on yahoo finance not accurate the first thing you need to know is that i believe the yahoo finance stated market caps are not completely correct as they do not seem to include the crazy free m idi rsu shares that will be issued to honig and brausers through marlin ifwhen idi hits the comically low hurdle of m of sales or m of sales and positive ebitda excluding stock comp at todays price i estimate those rsu shares alone are  dilution to current shareholders and if you correct for this i estimate idis current true market cap is m valuing idi best case fair value analysis shows  downside even if idi insiders were geniuses and had shareholder interests at heart and we use the most optimistic estimates possible idi inc is still overvalued by somewhere between  and  today thankfully valuing idi inc is actually very easy as we have two very direct and recent comparisons we can use to value idi one of them is literally the transaction of the company idi just bought that makes up all of idis ongoing business the other recent comparison is the recent auction of tlo llc which i believe is clearly a superior business to idi in every way possible but we can use that sale price as the most optimistic upward bound possible for valuing idi inc with these relevant comparisons we can then use some of the most optimistic assumptions possible to estimate fair value for idi inc unfortunately even using the most optimistic assumptions possible i still come up with per share value for idi inc stock with between  and  of downside today note this would also be very consistent with many other honigbrauser wipeouts which quickly fall between  and  estimated chart created by me as you can see above valuing idi based on the interactive data llc transaction they just did shows fair value per share for idi inc of  per share for  downside from todays stock price note that this analysis is using a m tm revenue estimate for idi inc also which i believe is quite generous considering the m in revenue interactive data llc was just producing and the nearly  in recent rd spend they disclosed if we use ole poulsen and derek drubners latest bankruptcy tlo llc we can see that despite multiple bidders and an extended auction there was only m of equitystockholder value left note that this purchase price by transunion likely assumes that tlos products could be pushed through transunions enormous global sales force allowing transunion to pay more than would typically be a fair value if we use that equity valuation as a comp for idi we see that idi inc stock is worth a maximum of  per share for  near term downside for current shareholders if we even take the whole analysis to the most optimistic view possible and literally completely ignore all of the m in debtliabilities tlo llc filed bankruptcy with and just give that all to equity holders instead then retain the bullish m revenue estimate for idi inc we still see that idi inc stock has near term downside of  from today as you can see idi inc today trades at what is an impossible bubblicious valuation that would make many dot com stocks blush educational tip if you ever see a promotional investor presentation with endless rambling about the addressable market but zero mention of the companys current financials or earnings that company is likely to be a future wipeout picture credit frost himself seems to know idi inc not worth anything close to todays prices lastly and most hilariously we know frost expressed interest in bidding on tlo in bankruptcy we know tlo had  employees was built by the founding genius of the industry had m of liabilities presumably a good proxy for cash burned and took  years to be built with m of revenue clearly i think tlo is a superior company to idi inc in every way possible picture credit we also know that transunion nysetru initially won the stalking horse with their m bid which basically wiped out the equity and covered the debtliabilities after frost was rumored to have put in a bid worth m leaving  value for tlo equityshareholders from this we can clearly infer that frost was not interested in paying m to own the vastly superior tlo company otherwise he would have been the stalking horse or done the dip etc yet now we have idi inc inferior in every way imaginable trading for m implied valuation plungey makes the call idi will be another shareholder wipeout with  wipeout or worse picture credit me and indiana jones idi inc  near term downside with wipeout coming  dont fall for it i believe the bottom line is that under no reasonably reality is idi worth anything even vaguely close to m the people in charge of idi saw their last company recently go bankrupt despite leadership from the undisputed king of the modern data era hank ahser who unfortunately passed away and will be deeply missed remember tlo took  years hundreds of employees and apparently at least m of cash to build and that still went bankrupt and nearly wiped out the equity investors entirely michael brauser and barry honig seem to me a penny stock wipeout team so toxic that even if frost invests their involvement virtually ensures wipeout or fraud accusations the wreckage of bankruptcy and wipeout in their path is truly eye watering in my view furthermore idi currently trades at a bubblicious valuation relative to obviously superior and much larger companies while the current yahoo message board stock promotion campaign is extremely concerning while hyped up data fusion fad claims and yahoo message board stock promotion may temporarily inflate any stocks valuation reality and the wave of idi stock sales coming will bring this disaster crashing back down like so many other honig and brauser wipeouts ultimately idi is made up of a tiny  year old struggling debt collection service paid for with m in cash and no amount of weirdly promotional stock tout articles or confused mom  pop retail stockholders can change that this temporarily insane x revenue valuation coupled with large m shelf offering filed and a huge volume of shares becoming unlocked means insiders could aggressively dump their shares onto the market until idi falls all the way to  per share at which point idi would still have another  downside even from there i believe it is obvious that like vrng izea bvsn usel drop and countless others the end will come suddenly and violently leaving retail shareholders essentially no chance to avoid suffering a crippling financial loss dont fall for it disclosure i amwe are short idi i wrote this article myself

michael brauser and his wife betsy brauser celebrate  years of betsy’s participation in a clinical trial at the dana farber cancer institute in july the institute recognized the ongoing success of treating inoperable cervical cancer with experimental treatments via clinical trials boca raton florida prweb january   michael and betsy brauser celebrated  years of betsy’s participation in a clinical trial at the dana farber cancer institute for betsy the clinical trial has been lifesaving as she has been on the trial for more than six years and her cancer has not worsened betsy brauser was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in  she underwent standard chemotherapy but a year later went to danafarber when new tumors were found in her pelvic area a biopsy confirmed the cancer had returned in an inoperable form betsy and her husband michael were given two options a standard chemotherapy repeat or enroll in a new clinical trial comparing the drugs cediranib and olaparib both in pill form versus olaparib alone for the brausers it was an easy choice the clinical trial offered them the best opportunity to look toward the future the clinical trial’s leaders felt confident about its potential based on the two drugs involved cediranib is an angiogenesis inhibitor that prevents tumors from forming new blood vessels that help them grow and spread olaparib is part of a class of agents known as parp inhibitors that was then starting to show promise in tumors that had trouble repairing damaged dna quote “the combination of olaparib and cediranib has shown significant promise in the fight against ovarian cancer it has been wonderful and very encouraging to see firsthand women like betsy directly benefiting from this combination and our research here at danafarber” said ursula matulonis md senior author of the trial and interim director of the susan f smith center” the study has since been expanded to many more women with recurrent ovarian cancer as a phase  trial the report of which was ranked as the most influential publication of  in breast gynecologic and obstetric disorders by the columbia hospital for women research foundation quote “the results of these trials have suggested that oral combinations could be a vital part of how to combat ovarian cancer we have now opened two large ncisponsored trials that will examine how the combination of cediranib and olaparib compares to standard chemotherapy as a treatment for the disease said dr joyce liu director of clinical research for gynecologic oncology at the susan f smith center “ michael and betsy
