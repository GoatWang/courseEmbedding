art  sculptural teapots a plethora of innovative techniques   over the past  years richard notkin has established a reputation as an artist who follows his own passions and not the prevailing winds of doctrine this intensive fastpaced threeday workshop will cover the diverse technical and aesthetic approaches which notkin uses to create his unique works in clay throughout the workshop notkin will discuss various aesthetic considerations including format and compositional devices alteration and metamorphosis of form and imagery choice of scale creating a narrative etc the first day of the workshop will consist of several handson sessions and will provide the students with unique working experiences challenging each to explore clay in unusual and unexpected ways day one class size  all levels welcome the second and third days will mostly consist of various demonstrations and slide lectures by richard covering a wide range of aesthetic and technical information including handbuilding small and largescale carving surface textures and detailing clay body alterations through the addition of nonceramic materials clay layering techniques plaster moldmaking slipcasting and pressmolding and more by encouraging participants to think beyond the traditional parameters of the standard pottery studio this workshop is designed to expand the aesthetic and technical horizons for beginning

 check out some of our upcoming workshops richard notkin bio notkin richard b  chicago il lives in helena mt a fulltime studio artist in helena mt notkins teapots ceramic sculptures and tile murals are visual explorations into social and political commentary through the s s and s when large scale abstract expressionist vessels and gestural ceramic sculptures were the rage in contemporary american ceramics notkin worked with a tightly controlled high degree of craftsmanship creating works which were often criticized as being too small tight and precious he took this as a compliment he is perhaps most known for his series of unglazed stoneware teapots inspired by the remarkable yixing wares of china circa  ad to the present but consciously maintaining a separate cultural identity reflecting the current dilemmas of our contemporary human civilization for over three and a half decades his work has been exhibited internationally and is in numerous public and private collections including the metropolitan museum of art new york smithsonian institution washington dc los angeles county museum of art victoria and albert museum london and shigaraki ceramic cultural park japan notkins awards include three fellowships from the national endowment for the arts and fellowships from the john simon guggenheim memorial foundation and louis comfort tiffany foundation richard notkin artist statement we have stumbled into the st century with the advanced technologies of star wars and the emotional maturity of cavemen if we cant find more creative solutions to solving worldwide social and political problems than sending young men and women to shred and incinerate one anothers flesh with weapons of ever increasing efficiency we will not survive to celebrate the passage into the nd century and to make a dangerous situation worse our country and too many of our fragile planets nations are now in the hands of right wing thugs and fundamentalist tyrants who are fumbling the planet towards world war iii it is for these reasons and far more that i have chosen to continue to make ceramic sculptures which reflect on the social and political dilemmas of our world as andr�

products are building brick paving brick terracotta facing tile roofing tile and drainage pipe these objects are made from commonly occurring natural materials which are mixed with water formed into the desired shape and fired in a kiln in order to give the clay mixture a permanent bond finished structural clay products display such essential properties as loadbearing strength resistance to wear resistance to chemical attack attractive appearance and an ability to take a decorative finishin this article the raw materials properties and general applications of structural clay products are reviewed at certain points reference is made to industrial processes employed in the manufacture of structural clay products for more detailed description of these processes the reader is referred to the article traditional ceramicsraw materials and processingstructural clay products are made from  to  percent clays or argillaceous clayey shales  to  percent quartz and  to  percent feldspar as with all traditional ceramic products the clay portion acts as a former providing shaping ability the quartz silica serves as a filler providing strength to the formed object and the feldspar serves as a fluxing agent lowering the melting temperatures of the clay and quartz during firing the proportions cited above are often found directly in shale deposits so that blending is often not necessary in addition little or no beneficiation or crushing and grinding of the mined material is employed local clays or shales of highly variable composition are used in order to keep transportation costs as low as possible the colour of the finished product derives from impurities most notably iron oxides present in the raw materials colours can range from buff and other light shades of brown through red to black depending upon whether an oxidizing or reducing atmosphere exists in the kiln similar topics industrial ceramics materials processing materials science metamaterial wood materials testing metal glass semiconductor naval stores in the processing of structural clay products stiffmud plasticforming operations predominate—for example pressing operations for brick and extrusion for brick or pipe see figure  these processes are described in the article traditional ceramics formed objects are usually fired in continuous conveyor belt or railcar operations with the ware as it traverses the tunnel kiln proceeding from room temperature into a hot zone and finally to a cooler zone at the other endpropertiesthe properties exhibited by structural clay products are determined by particle size firing temperature and ultimate microstructure compared with finer ceramic products such as whitewares much coarser filler particles are used and lower firing temperatures are employed—typically in the range of ° to ° c approximately ° to ° f at such low temperatures the filler particles usually crushed quartz are normally not affected instead the clay or shale ingredients contain sufficient impurities to melt and form a glass thus bonding the particles together as is the case with whitewares crystalline mullite needles grow into this glassy phase the resulting microstructure consists of large secondary particles embedded in a matrix of finegrained mullite and glass—all containing a substantial volume of large poresbecause of the presence of large and small particles in their microstructures fired clay products have relatively high compressive strengths this ability to bear relatively heavy loads without fracture is the prime property qualifying these products for structural applications the size and number of pores is also important if underfired structural clay products have low strength and poor resistance to frost and freezing owing to the presence of many small pores in the clay regions overfired ware on the other hand has too much glass it is strong but brittle and is susceptible to failure under mechanical and thermal stress furthermore it is impossible to obtain a good bond when glassy products are used with mortars small pores and high glass content are desirable however when chemical resistance and imperviousness to water penetration
