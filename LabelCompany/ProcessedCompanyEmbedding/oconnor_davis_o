included schools daycare centers community organizations correctional facilities and social service agencies marymount arranged for oconnor to be placed for her senioryear internship with rockland a hospital for the mentally disabled operated by new york state because this internship was considered to be work study for financial aid purposes oconnor received through marymount federal work study funds for the time she spent performing her volunteer work with rockland oconnors internship with rockland began on september   the hours oconnor worked were flexible although she generally chose to work on mondays and wednesdays from approximately  am to  pm because that schedule did not conflict with her regular marymount classes oconnor regularly attended morning staff meetings with rockland employees and other volunteers met with the patients assigned to her both oneonone and in groups she then documented the results of these patient sessions in process recordings which were given first to her rockland supervisor lisa punzone punzone and then to faculty at marymount dr james davis davis worked as a licensed psychiatrist at rockland approximately two days after oconnor began her internship davis referred to oconnor in her presence as miss sexual harassmenta term davis later explained was intended as a compliment to convey the idea that oconnor was physically attractive and as such was likely to be the object of sexual harassment oconnor promptly complained about daviss comment to punzone who explained that davis made similar comments to her and that oconnor should try her best to ignore him not only did davis continue to address oconnor as miss sexual harassment he added to his repertoire of inappropriate sexual remarks for instance on one monday morning davis told oconnor that she looked tired and that she and her boyfriend must have had a good time the night before on another occasion davis pointed to a picture in a newspaper of a woman dressed only in underwear and announced that oconnor was the woman photographed he also suggested to oconnor and other women present that they should participate in an orgy  finally on yet another occasion davis told oconnor to remove her clothing in preparation for a meeting with him he explained dont you always take your clothes off before you go in the doctors office oconnor was apparently not daviss only target he also commented regularly on the physical appearance of a number of women employed at rockland and directed sexual jokes and sexually suggestive noises at themparticularly as davis put it on

construed by this court oconnor argues that because rockland provides its volunteers with some modicum of onthejob training rockland therefore provides vocational training and on that basis may be considered to operate an organized educational program we decline however to convert rocklands willingness to accept volunteers into conduct analogous to administering an education program as contemplated by title ix sept   both parties on appeal and the district court below addressed themselves to the question of whether or not oconnor was an employee within this framework however we think that this analysis is flawed because it ignores the antecedent question of whether oconnor was hired by rockland for any purpose as the supreme court suggests the common feature shared by both the employee and the independent contractor is that they are hired parties id and thus a prerequisite to considering whether an individual is one or the other under commonlaw agency principles is that the individual have been hired in the first instance that is only where a hire has occurred should the commonlaw agency analysis be undertaken other courts have agreed with this view as the eighth circuit has explained courts turn to commonlaw principles to analyze the character of an economic relationship only in situations that plausibly approximate an employment relationship graves v womens profl rodeo assoc  fd   th cir where no financial benefit is obtained by the purported employee from the employer no plausible employment relationship of any sort can be said to exist because although compensation by the putative employer to the putative employee in exchange for his services is not a sufficient condition  it is an essential condition to the existence of an employeremployee relationship graves  fd at  see also neff v civil air patrol  fsupp   sdohio  smith v berks community television  fsupp   edpa cf haavistola v community fire co  fd   th cir  usc § a title ix has been construed to prohibit gender discrimination against students and employees alike in educational institutions that receive federal funding see murray v new york univ college of dentistry  fd   d cir citing north haven bd of educ v bell  us    sct    ledd   plaintiffappellant bridget oconnor oconnor appeals from the may   judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant j granting the summary judgment motion of defendantsappellees rockland psychiatric center rockland and the state of new york and dismissing oconnors sexual harassment claims which were brought pursuant to both title vii of the civil rights act of  § e as amended  usc § e et seq title vii and title ix of education amendments of  § a as amended  usc §§  et seq title ix for the following reasons we affirm the definition of the term employee provided in title vii is circular the act states only that an employee is an individual employed by an employer  usc § ef see also eeoc v johnson  higgins  fd   d cir however it is well established that when congress uses the term employee without defining it with precision courts should presume that congress had in mind the conventional masterservant relationship as understood by the commonlaw agency doctrine nationwide mut ins co v darden  us    sct    ledd   quoting community for creative nonviolence v reid  us    sct    ledd   see also walters v metropolitan educ enters inc  us    sct    ledd   frankel v bally inc  fd   d cir janine m spinnato assistant attorney general new york city dennis c vacco attorney general new york city thomas d hughes assistant attorney general new york city on the brief for defendantsappellees any part of which is extended federal financial assistance b a local educational agency  system of vocational education or other school system by allowing an intern to perform the fieldwork required of her by the wholly unaffiliated college she attends rockland is not transformed into an employer under title vii or into an administrator of an education program or activity under title ix we conclude by saying only that we are not unsympathetic to oconnors situation we recognize for example that from her perspective her success at marymount was dependent to some degree on successfully completing her internship with rockland and that her dependency on rockland made her vulnerable to continued harassment much as an employee dependent on a regular wage can be vulnerable to ongoing misconduct in a similar vein we recognize that oconnor was not in quite the same position to simply walk away from the alleged harassment as are many other volunteers however it is for congress if it should choose to do so and not this court to provide a remedy under either title vii or title ix for plaintiffs in oconnors position we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court because the absence of either direct or indirect economic remuneration or the promise thereof is undisputed in this case we agree with the district court that oconnor was not a rockland employee within the meaning of title vii and thus that her discrimination claim under that statute must fail a a college university postsecondary institution or a public system of higher education or  we reject oconnors claim that she was compensated to the extent that she received through marymount federal work study funding for the hours of volunteer work performed at rockland plainly it was marymountnot rocklandthat made these payments to oconnor  fd  walker circuit judge davis  cfr § n emphasis supplied rockland plainly does not satisfy this definition as its primary purpose is in no sense to educate it accepts no tuition has no teachers has no evaluation process and requires no regular hours or course of study for its volunteer workers b the entity of such state or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency  to which the assistance to a state or local government is extended craig t dickinson white plains ny jonathan lovett lovett  gould white plains ny on the brief for plaintiffappellant  we note that oconnors complaint contains no allegation that rockland receives any federal funding instead oconnor refers to federal funding only in her description of marymount a party since dropped from the case however because oconnors complaint does allege that rockland is an agency of new york state we will construe her complaint broadly to allege that as a state healthcare agency rockland receives federal money in connection with medical services providedan inference we think equitable given that rockland does not contest on appeal the question of federal funding oconnor for the purposes of this chapter the term program or activity and program mean all of the operations of v in determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency we consider the hiring partys right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required the source of the instrumentalities and tools the location of the work the duration of the relationship between the parties whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party the extent of the hired partys discretion over when and how long to work the method of payment the hired partys role in hiring and paying assistants whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party whether the hiring party is in business the provision of employee benefits and the tax treatment of the hired party case no   although oconnor reported a good deal of this conduct to punzone punzone did not report any of oconnors complaints to james wagner her own supervisor until january of  and when wagner learned of oconnors encounters with davis he like punzone did nothing to remedy the situation not only is rocklands internship program not classifiable as a vocational program rockland also cannot be said more generally to operate an education program because the institution maintains none of the characteristics associated with being an educator the environment at rockland is not for example analogous to a teaching hospitals mixed employmenttraining context see lipsett v university of puerto rico  fd   st cir henschke v new york hospcornell med ctr  fsupp  sdny nor is rocklands acceptance of volunteers comparable to running an educational or vocational program at a state correctional facility see eg jeldness v pearce  fd  th cir women prisoners of the dist of columbia dept of corrections v district of columbia  fsupp   ddc as such programs typically provide instructors evaluations and offer a particular course of training in response to the courts interpretation of title ix as well as out of concern that the grove city definition of program or activity would be applied to similar language contained in §  of the rehabilitation act of  the age discrimination act of  and title vi of the civil rights act of  congress passed the civil rights restoration act of  publ no  sec a §   stat    codified at  usc §  the  amendment which amended each of the affected statutes including title ix by adding a section broadly redefining the term program or activity see srep no  at   reprinted in  usccan   see also cohen v brown univ  fd   st cir the amendment to title ix provides in relevant part oconnors second argument is that the district court erred in dismissing her title ix claim in the belief that title ix did not apply to rockland because rockland is not an education program or activity oconnor urges that because rockland both receives federal financial assistance either through the state its patients or its employees and also operates vocational training through an organized educational program appellants brief at  it is subject to title ixs prohibition against sex discriminationproscribed conduct that includes sexual harassment see franklin v gwinnett county pub schs  us    sct    ledd   kracunas  fd at  we disagree however by modifying the phrase program or activity congress left the modifier education intact and we are bound under ordinary rules of statutory construction to give content to the entire phrase selected by congress see connecticut dept of income maintenance v heckler  us   n   sct   n   ledd   in so doing we think it evident that in order to implicate title ix in the first instance an entity must have features such that one could reasonably consider its mission to be at least in part educational that congress intended this interpretation can be discerned if vaguely in the following example of the effect of the new statute contained in the senate report accompanying the  amendment a school or institution except an institution of professional or undergraduate higher education which has as its primary purpose preparation of students to pursue a technical skilled or semiskilled occupation or trade  whether or not the school or institution offers certificates diplomas or degrees and whether or not it offers fulltime study oconnors internship with rockland began on september   the hours oconnor worked were flexible although she generally chose to work on mondays and wednesdays from approximately  am to  pm because that schedule did not conflict with her regular marymount classes oconnor regularly attended morning staff meetings with rockland employees and other volunteers met with the patients assigned to her both oneonone and in groups she then documented the results of these patient sessions in process recordings which were given first to her rockland supervisor lisa punzone punzone and then to faculty at marymount finally the fact that marymount operates an education program may not be imputed to rockland simply because oconnor was a student at the former while she performed volunteer work with the latter factors that could lead to a different conclusion simply are not present here the two entities have no institutional affiliation there is no written agreement binding the two entities in any way no staff are shared no funds are circulated between them and indeed marymount students had previously volunteered at rockland on only a few occasions the only hint of a connection between marymount and rockland lies in the fact that  marymount contacted rockland for the purpose of placing oconnor in an internship and  marymount appears to base its evaluation of its students performance during their internships in part on an evaluation prepared by the person who supervised the student onsitewhich in oconnors case would have been lisa punzone of rockland such connections are insufficient to establish rockland as an agent or arm of marymount for title ix purposes rather we think it clear that rockland is a statefunded psychiatric hospital with no affiliation to any educational institution whatsoever that allows volunteers from a nearby college to perform with minimal supervision volunteer work at its facility rockland thus does not conduct an education program or activity and oconnors title ix claim was properly dismissed not only did davis continue to address oconnor as miss sexual harassment he added to his repertoire of inappropriate sexual remarks for instance on one monday morning davis told oconnor that she looked tired and that she and her boyfriend must have had a good time the night before on another occasion davis pointed to a picture in a newspaper of a woman dressed only in underwear and announced that oconnor was the woman photographed he also suggested to oconnor and other women present that they should participate in an orgy finally on yet another occasion davis told oconnor to remove her clothing in preparation for a meeting with him he explained dont you always take your clothes off before you go in the doctors office at issue in the present case is whether an entity such as rockland that  is a staterun clinic that receives federal money and  permits studentinterns from a college with which it has no affiliation to perform volunteer field work at its facility is subject to title ix on the ground that it operates an education program or activity if a private hospital corporation is extended federal assistance for its emergency rooms the pediatrics department admissions discharge offices etc are covered under title vi section  and the age discrimination act since title ix is limited to education programs or activities it would only apply to the students and employees of educational programs operated by the hospital if any united states court of appeals second circuit in most cases where an attempt has been made to discern the contours of the conventional masterservant relationship it has been because a court has been asked to consider whether under a particular statute a party is an employee or an independent contractor see eg reid  us at   sct at  considering the copyright act of   usc §  darden  us    sct    ledd   considering erisa  usc § a alford v united states  fd   th cir considering  usc § a of the internal revenue code cilecek v inova health sys servs  fd   th cir considering title vii sharkey v ultramar energy ltd  fd   d cir considering erisa in this context the supreme court has outlined the following factors culled from the restatement of agency see reid  us at  n   sct at  n  and from caselaw as relevant to the inquiry while enrolled as a student at marymount college marymount a private catholic college located in tarrytown new york bridget oconnor majored in social work as a component of her major oconnor was required during her senior year to perform  hours of field work at one of several marymountapproved organizations which in the past had included schools daycare centers community organizations correctional facilities and social service agencies marymount arranged for oconnor to be placed for her senioryear internship with rockland a hospital for the mentally disabled operated by new york state because this internship was considered to be work study for financial aid purposes oconnor received through marymount federal work study funds for the time she spent performing her volunteer work with rockland finally at some point in january of  oconnor left rockland however marymount arranged for her to complete her internship at another facility srep no  at   reprinted in  usccan   while expanding the reach of title ix to include all departments or branches of an educational institution or program that receives federal funding the foregoing suggests to us that the  amendment did not purport to alter the preliminary requirement that the entity funded operate an education program also in january of  oconnor complained to virginia kaiser marymounts social work field instructor who in turn brought daviss conduct to the attention of madeline connolly rocklands director of social work connolly then notified wilbur t aldridge rocklands affirmative action administrator who thereafter investigated oconnors complaint dr james davis davis worked as a licensed psychiatrist at rockland approximately two days after oconnor began her internship davis referred to oconnor in her presence as miss sexual harassmenta term davis later explained was intended as a compliment to convey the idea that oconnor was physically attractive and as such was likely to be the object of sexual harassment oconnor promptly complained about daviss comment to punzone who explained that davis made similar comments to her and that oconnor should try her best to ignore him  the honorable gerald w heaney of the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit sitting by designationin a ruling not challenged on appeal the district court also found that the plaintiff had abandoned the claims she brought pursuant to  usc §  oconnor was apparently not daviss only target he also commented regularly on the physical appearance of a number of women employed at rockland and directed sexual jokes and sexually suggestive noises at themparticularly as davis put it on occasions when he thought the women looked very well that day davis also made jokes about female patientssuggesting in one instance that a women patient would benefit from sterilization and on another occasion when considering a woman patient who was an incest victim stating the family that plays together stays together  usc §  following the  amendment courts have consistently interpreted title ix to mean that if one arm of a university or state agency receives federal funds the entire entity is subject to title ixs proscription against sex discrimination see horner v kentucky high sch athletic assn  fd   th cir cohen  fd at  before walker parker and heaney circuit judges in march of  oconnor filed the instant action against marymount rockland the state of new york and various marymount and rockland employees alleging inter alia sexual harassment in violation of title vii  usc § e et seq and title ix  usc §§  et seq the action was eventually discontinued against marymount punzone wagner connolly and davis himself the remaining defendants rockland and new york state moved for summary judgment on several grounds first they argued that the plaintiffs title vii claim should be dismissed because oconnor was not an employee of rockland within the meaning of title vii second the defendants argued that the title ix claim should be dismissed because rockland was not an educational institution as set forth in title ix finally the defendants argued that oconnor failed to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment a a department agency special purpose district or other instrumentality of a state or of a local government or summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law see fedrcivp c anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    sct    ledd   because summary judgment was granted against oconnor we consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to her see kracunas v iona college  fd   d ciri title vii reid  us at   sct at  footnotes omitted we believe that the preliminary question of remuneration is dispositive in this case it is uncontested that oconnor received from rockland no salary or other wages and no employee benefits such as health insurance vacation or sick pay nor was she promised any such compensation this case thus differs from haavistola v community fire co in which the fourth circuit considered whether a volunteer member of a fire company was an employee for title vii purposes where on the one hand plaintiff did not receive direct compensation as a member of the fire company but on the other hand she did not affiliate with the company without reward entirely  fd   th cir the court then noted that the plaintiff received through her volunteer position a statefunded disability pension survivors benefits for dependents scholarships for dependents upon death or disability group life insurance and several other benefits see id the court concluded that the district court granted summary judgment improvidently given that a factfinder should determine whether the benefits represent indirect but significant remuneration  or inconsequential incidents of an otherwise gratuitous relationship id at  in grove city college v bell  us    sct    ledd   the supreme court considered the meaning of title ixs phrase education program or activity and defined it narrowly holding that by referring to particular activities or programs congress intended that title ix apply only to the particular program receiving financial assistance thus in grove city the court found that the receipt by students of federal grants did not trigger institutionwide title ix coverage but only coverage of the schools financial aid program id at   sct at  this essential condition of remuneration has been recognized in this circuit as well in tadros v coleman  fd   d cir we explicitly upheld the dismissal of the title vii claims of a plaintiff who worked as a volunteer on the faculty of cornell medical college on the ground that the plaintiff was not an employee under title vii as a volunteer the plaintiff received no salary health benefits retirement benefits and also had no regular hours assigned to him by the hospital in concluding that the plaintiff was not an employee the district court in tadros held that a title vii plaintiff is only an employee if the defendant both pays him and controls his work  fsupp   sdny in an opinion and order dated may   the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion agreeing that oconnor was not an employee under title vii and that rockland was not an educational institution under title ix because of this disposition the district court did not reach the defendants assertion that oconnor failed to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment preliminarily in light of oconnors contention that rocklands internship program is analogous to vocational training it is instructive to look to  cfr §  which defines for title ix purposes the term institution of vocational education as no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance oconnors first argument on appeal is that the district court improperly concluded that she was not a rockland employee within the meaning of title vii she argues that although she worked at rockland as an unpaid intern she nevertheless

united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant j granting the summary judgment motion of defendantsappellees rockland psychiatric center rockland and the state of new york and dismissing oconnors sexual harassment claims which were brought pursuant to both title vii of the civil rights act of  § e as amended  usc § e et seq title vii and title ix of education amendments of  § a as amended  usc §§  et seq title ix for the following reasons we affirm background  while enrolled as a student at marymount college marymount a private catholic college located in tarrytown new york bridget oconnor majored in social work as a component of her major oconnor was required during her senior year to perform  hours of field work at one of several marymountapproved organizations which in the past had included schools daycare centers community organizations correctional facilities and social service agencies marymount arranged for oconnor to be placed for her senioryear internship with rockland a hospital for the mentally disabled operated by new york state because this internship was considered to be work study for financial aid purposes oconnor received through marymount federal work study funds for the time she spent performing her volunteer work with rockland  oconnors internship with rockland began on september   the hours oconnor worked were flexible although she generally chose to work on mondays and wednesdays from approximately  am to  pm because that schedule did not conflict with her regular marymount classes oconnor regularly attended morning staff meetings with rockland employees and other volunteers met with the patients assigned to her both oneonone and in groups she then documented the results of these patient sessions in process recordings which were given first to her rockland supervisor lisa punzone punzone and then to faculty at marymount  dr james davis davis worked as a licensed psychiatrist at rockland approximately two days after oconnor began her internship davis referred to oconnor in her presence as miss sexual harassmenta term davis later explained was intended as a compliment to convey the idea that oconnor was physically attractive and as such was likely to be the object of sexual harassment oconnor promptly complained about daviss comment to punzone who explained that davis made similar comments to her and that oconnor should try her best to ignore him  not only did davis continue to address oconnor as miss sexual harassment he added to his repertoire of inappropriate sexual remarks for instance on one monday morning davis told oconnor that she looked tired and that she and her boyfriend must have had a good time the night before on another occasion davis pointed to a picture in a newspaper of a woman dressed only in underwear and announced that oconnor was the woman photographed he also suggested to oconnor and other women present that they should participate in an orgy finally on yet another occasion davis told oconnor to remove her clothing in preparation for a meeting with him he explained dont you always take your clothes off before you go in the doctors office  oconnor was apparently not daviss only target he also commented regularly on the physical appearance of a number of women employed at rockland and directed sexual jokes and sexually suggestive noises at themparticularly as davis put it on occasions when he thought the women looked very well that day davis also made jokes about female patientssuggesting in one instance that a women patient would benefit from sterilization and on another occasion when considering a woman patient who was an incest victim stating the family that plays together stays together  although oconnor reported a good deal of this conduct to punzone punzone did not report any of oconnors complaints to james wagner her own supervisor until january of  and when wagner learned of oconnors encounters with davis he like punzone did nothing to remedy the situation advertisement  also in january of  oconnor complained to virginia kaiser marymounts social work field instructor who in turn brought daviss conduct to the attention of madeline connolly rocklands director of social work connolly then notified wilbur t aldridge rocklands affirmative action administrator who thereafter investigated oconnors complaint  finally at some point in january of  oconnor left rockland however marymount arranged for her to complete her internship at another facility  in march of  oconnor filed the instant action against marymount rockland the state of new york and various marymount and rockland employees alleging inter alia sexual harassment in violation of title vii  usc § e et seq and title ix  usc §§  et seq the action was eventually discontinued against marymount punzone wagner connolly and davis himself the remaining defendants rockland and new york state moved for summary judgment on several grounds first they argued that the plaintiffs title vii claim should be dismissed because oconnor was not an employee of rockland within the meaning of title vii second the defendants argued that the title ix claim should be dismissed because rockland was not an educational institution as set forth in title ix finally the defendants argued that oconnor failed to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment  in an opinion and order dated may   the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion agreeing that oconnor was not an employee under title vii and that rockland was not an educational institution under title ix because of this disposition the district court did not reach the defendants assertion that oconnor failed to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment discussion  summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law see fedrcivp c anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    sct    ledd   because summary judgment was granted against oconnor we consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to her see kracunas v iona college  fd   d ciri title vii  oconnors first argument on appeal is that the district court improperly concluded that she was not a rockland employee within the meaning of title vii she argues that although she worked at rockland as an unpaid intern she nevertheless satisfies the commonlaw agency definition of employee we disagree  the definition of the term employee provided in title vii is circular the act states only that an employee is an individual employed by an employer  usc § ef see also eeoc v johnson  higgins  fd   d cir however it is well established that when congress uses the term employee without defining it with precision courts should presume that congress had in mind the conventional masterservant relationship as understood by the commonlaw agency doctrine nationwide mut ins co v darden  us    sct    ledd   quoting community for creative nonviolence v reid  us    sct    ledd   see also walters v metropolitan educ enters inc  us    sct    ledd   frankel v bally inc  fd   d cir  in most cases where an attempt has been made to discern the contours of the conventional masterservant relationship it has been because a court has been asked to consider whether under a particular statute a party is an employee or an independent contractor see eg reid  us at   sct at  considering the copyright act of   usc §  darden  us    sct    ledd   considering erisa  usc § a alford v united states  fd   th cir considering  usc § a of the internal revenue code cilecek v inova health sys servs  fd   th cir considering title vii sharkey v ultramar energy ltd  fd   d cir considering erisa in this context the supreme court has outlined the following factors culled from the restatement of agency see reid  us at  n   sct at  n  and from caselaw as relevant to the inquiry  in determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency we consider the hiring partys right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required the source of the instrumentalities and tools the location of the work the duration of the relationship between the parties whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party the extent of the hired partys discretion over when and how long to work the method of payment the hired partys role in hiring and paying assistants whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party whether the hiring party is in business the provision of employee benefits and the tax treatment of the hired party  reid  us at   sct at  footnotes omitted  both parties on appeal and the district court below addressed themselves to the question of whether or not oconnor was an employee within this framework however we think that this analysis is flawed because it ignores the antecedent question of whether oconnor was hired by rockland for any purpose as the supreme court suggests the common feature shared by both the employee and the independent contractor is that they are hired parties id and thus a prerequisite to considering whether an individual is one or the other under commonlaw agency principles is that the individual have been hired in the first instance that is only where a hire has occurred should the commonlaw agency analysis be undertaken  other courts have agreed with this view as the eighth circuit has explained courts turn to commonlaw principles to analyze the character of an economic relationship only in situations that plausibly approximate an employment relationship graves v womens profl rodeo assoc  fd   th cir where no financial benefit is obtained by the purported employee from the employer no plausible employment relationship of any sort can be said to exist because although compensation by the putative employer to the putative employee in exchange for his services is not a sufficient condition  it is an essential condition to the existence of an employeremployee relationship graves  fd at  see also neff v civil air patrol  fsupp   sdohio  smith v berks community television  fsupp   edpa cf haavistola v community fire co  fd   th cir  this essential condition of remuneration has been recognized in this circuit as well in tadros v coleman  fd   d cir we explicitly upheld the dismissal of the title vii claims of a plaintiff who worked as a volunteer on the faculty of cornell medical college on the ground that the plaintiff was not an employee under title vii as a volunteer the plaintiff received no salary health benefits retirement benefits and also had no regular hours assigned to him by the hospital in concluding that the plaintiff was not an employee the district court in tadros held that a title vii plaintiff is only an employee if the defendant both pays him and controls his work  fsupp   sdny  we believe that the preliminary question of remuneration is dispositive in this case it is uncontested that oconnor received from rockland no salary or other wages and no employee benefits such as health insurance vacation or sick pay nor was she promised any such compensation this case thus differs from haavistola v community fire co in which the fourth circuit considered whether a volunteer member of a fire company was an employee for title vii purposes where on the one hand plaintiff did not receive direct compensation as a member of the fire company but on the other hand she did not affiliate with the company without reward entirely  fd   th cir the court then noted that the plaintiff received through her volunteer position a statefunded disability pension survivors benefits for dependents scholarships for dependents upon death or disability group life insurance and several other benefits see id the court concluded that the district court granted summary judgment improvidently given that a factfinder should determine whether the benefits represent indirect but significant remuneration  or inconsequential incidents of an otherwise gratuitous relationship id at   because the absence of either direct or indirect economic remuneration or the promise thereof is undisputed in this case we agree with the district court that oconnor was not a rockland employee within the meaning of title vii and thus that her discrimination claim under that statute must fail ii title ix  oconnors second argument is that the district court erred in dismissing her title ix claim in the belief that title ix did not apply to rockland because rockland is not an education program or activity oconnor urges that because rockland both receives federal financial assistance either through the state its patients or its employees and also operates vocational training through an organized educational program appellants brief at  it is subject to title ixs prohibition against sex discriminationproscribed conduct that includes sexual harassment see franklin v gwinnett county pub schs  us    sct    ledd   kracunas  fd at  we disagree title ix provides in pertinent part that  no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance   usc § a title ix has been construed to prohibit gender discrimination against students and employees alike in educational institutions that receive federal funding see murray v new york univ college of dentistry  fd   d cir citing north haven bd of educ v bell  us    sct    ledd    at issue in the present case is whether an entity such as rockland that  is a staterun clinic that receives federal money and  permits studentinterns from a college with which it has no affiliation to perform volunteer field work at its facility is subject to title ix on the ground that it operates an education program or activity  in grove city college v bell  us    sct    ledd   the supreme court considered the meaning of title ixs phrase education program or activity and defined it narrowly holding that by referring to particular activities or programs congress intended that title ix apply only to the particular program receiving financial assistance thus in grove city the court found that the receipt by students of federal grants did not trigger institutionwide title ix coverage but only coverage of the schools financial aid program id at   sct at   in response to the courts interpretation of title ix as well as out of concern that the grove city definition of program or activity would be applied to similar language contained in §  of the rehabilitation act of  the age discrimination act of  and title vi of the civil rights act of  congress passed the civil rights restoration act of  publ no  sec a §   stat    codified at  usc §  the  amendment which amended each of the affected statutes including title ix by adding a section broadly redefining the term program or activity see srep no  at   reprinted in  usccan   see also cohen v brown univ  fd   st cir the amendment to title ix provides in relevant part  for the purposes of this chapter the term program or activity and program mean all of the operations of  a a department agency special purpose district or other instrumentality of a state or of a local government or  b the entity of such state or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency  to which the assistance to a state or local government is extended  a a college university postsecondary institution or a public system of higher education or  b a local educational agency  system of vocational education or other school system  any part of which is extended federal financial assistance   usc §  following the  amendment courts have consistently interpreted title ix to mean that if one arm of a university or state agency receives federal funds the entire entity is subject to title ixs proscription against sex discrimination see horner v kentucky high sch athletic assn  fd   th cir cohen  fd at   however by modifying the phrase program or activity congress left the modifier education intact and we are bound under ordinary rules of statutory construction to give content to the entire phrase selected by congress see connecticut dept of income maintenance v heckler  us   n   sct   n   ledd   in so doing we think it evident that in order to implicate title ix in the first instance an entity must have features such that one could reasonably consider its mission to be at least in part educational that congress intended this interpretation can be discerned if vaguely in the following example of the effect of the new statute contained in the senate report accompanying the  amendment  if a private hospital corporation is extended federal assistance for its emergency rooms the pediatrics department admissions discharge offices etc are covered under title vi section  and the age discrimination act since title ix is limited to education programs or activities it would only apply to the students and employees of educational programs operated by the hospital if any  srep no  at   reprinted in  usccan   while expanding the reach of title ix to include all departments or branches of an educational institution or program that receives federal funding the foregoing suggests to us that the  amendment did not purport to alter the preliminary requirement that the entity funded operate an education program  although the term education is not defined by the regulations governing title ix and has not been construed by this court oconnor argues that because rockland provides its volunteers with some modicum of onthejob training rockland therefore provides vocational training and on that basis may be considered to operate an organized educational program we decline however to convert rocklands willingness to accept volunteers into conduct analogous to administering an education program as contemplated by title ix  preliminarily in light of oconnors contention that rocklands internship program is analogous to vocational training it is instructive to look to  cfr §  which defines for title ix purposes the term institution of vocational education as  a school or institution except an institution of professional or undergraduate higher education which has as its primary purpose preparation of students to pursue a technical skilled or semiskilled occupation or trade  whether or not the school or institution offers certificates diplomas or degrees and whether or not it offers fulltime study   cfr § n emphasis supplied rockland plainly does not satisfy this definition as its primary purpose is in no sense to educate it accepts no tuition has no teachers has no evaluation process and requires no regular hours or course of study for its volunteer workers  not only is rocklands internship program not classifiable as a vocational program rockland also cannot be said more generally to operate an education program because the institution maintains none of the characteristics associated with being an educator the environment at rockland is not for example analogous to a teaching hospitals mixed employmenttraining context see lipsett v university of puerto rico  fd   st cir henschke v new york hospcornell med ctr  fsupp  sdny nor is rocklands acceptance of volunteers comparable to running an educational or vocational program at a state correctional facility see eg jeldness v pearce  fd  th cir women prisoners of the dist of columbia dept of corrections v district of columbia  fsupp   ddc as such programs typically provide instructors evaluations and offer a particular course of training  finally the fact that marymount operates an education program may not be imputed to rockland simply because oconnor was a student at the former while she performed volunteer work with the latter factors that could lead to a different conclusion simply are not present here the two entities have no institutional affiliation there is no written agreement binding the two entities in any way no staff are shared no funds are circulated between them and indeed marymount students had previously volunteered at rockland on only a few occasions the only hint of a connection between marymount and rockland lies in the fact that  marymount contacted rockland for the purpose of placing oconnor in an internship and  marymount appears to base its evaluation of its students performance during their internships in part on an evaluation prepared by the person who supervised the student onsitewhich in oconnors case would have been lisa punzone of rockland such connections are insufficient to establish rockland as an agent or arm of marymount for title ix purposes rather we think it clear that rockland is a statefunded psychiatric hospital with no affiliation to any educational institution whatsoever that allows volunteers from a nearby college to perform with minimal supervision volunteer work at its facility rockland thus does not conduct an education program or activity and oconnors title ix claim was properly dismissed conclusion  by allowing an intern to perform the fieldwork required of her by the wholly unaffiliated college she attends rockland is not transformed into an employer under title vii or into an administrator of an education program or activity under title ix we conclude by saying only that we are not unsympathetic to oconnors situation we recognize for example that from her perspective her success at marymount was dependent to some degree on successfully completing her internship with rockland and that her dependency on rockland made her vulnerable to continued harassment much as an employee dependent on a regular wage can be vulnerable to ongoing misconduct in a similar vein we recognize that oconnor was not in quite the same position to simply walk away from the alleged harassment as are many other volunteers however it is for congress if it should choose to do so and not this court to provide a remedy under either title vii or title ix for plaintiffs in oconnors position we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court  the honorable gerald w heaney of the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit sitting by designation  in a ruling not challenged on appeal the district court also found that the plaintiff had abandoned the claims she brought pursuant to  usc §   we reject oconnors claim that she was compensated to the extent that she received through marymount federal work study funding for the hours of volunteer work performed at rockland plainly it was marymountnot rocklandthat made these payments to oconnor  we note that oconnors complaint contains no allegation that rockland receives any federal funding instead oconnor refers to federal funding only in her description of marymount a party since dropped from the case however because oconnors complaint does allege that rockland is an agency of new york state we will construe her complaint broadly to allege that as a state healthcare agency rockland receives federal money in connection with medical services providedan inference we think equitable given that rockland does not contest on appeal the question of federal funding advertisement printemail short url advertisement advertisement homefederal reporter third series fd home browse openjurist learn the law terms of use pkf o’connor davies reviews
