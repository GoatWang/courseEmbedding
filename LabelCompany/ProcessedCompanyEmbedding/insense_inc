copal  what is frankincense what is myrrh  what is sandalwood   vists our blog  click here for blog home  what is copal  what is copalcopal is a tree resin that has been used since precolumbian times in various ceremonies and as an ingredient in varnish for wood and trains it originated in mexico but now it grows all over the world the word copal is a shortened version of “copalli” which is a nahuatl a word that means incense to the mayan people it was called pom and others have nicknamed it young amber the resin itself was also popular in east africa which enabled the indian ocean to fulfill its demands for this ever popular resin in modern times copal is widely used as a standalone or as an ingredient in the blend of many incense fragrances copal incense is available in different forms each with a similar scent black copal is considered by some the most desirable for its rich and heavy scent golden copal has the sweetest scent and offers a good balance white copal is sweeter smelling than black varieties but not as rich nor as sweet as golden copal all three can be used interchangeably and the choice is up to the individual however the smoke can be heavy so use only as much as you needthe incense can also be used in ceremonies or rituals that call for frankincense as copal incense has been referred to as the mexican frankincense its even possible after cultivation on other continents which it served as more readily available incense for other indigenous people the choice is up to each individual though many have found that copal is more readily availablethe magical properties of copal incense differ depending upon which type is chosen black copal for example is commonly associated with grounding and nighttime it was also commonly used as an offering to the mayan deities as it was considered by the people to be the food of the gods they would collect the sap turn it into a paste and store it in the “gods house” this symbolic practice has changed over the years but in guatemala copal is sold in disk form to resemble wafers and theyre wrapped in either banana leaves or husk packaging to symbolize foodcopal has also been used as a method of divination as shamans would burn the incense and interpret the smoke at other times depending upon belief the shaman would cast grains of maize after holding them in the smoke and chanting the zapotecs in milta oaxaca would burn the copal under water for finding the cause of fright as it was thought the underside would reveal a picturehowever the most common use for this resin today is its use in ceremonies and in the production of commercial incense it is used to purify objects enter trances and or chosen for a specific use in a ceremony the second use would be the use in sweat lodges where its commonly used to cleanse the body mind and soul this practice is still in use today and has been used specifically by the native americans as well as the indigenous people of mexico and
