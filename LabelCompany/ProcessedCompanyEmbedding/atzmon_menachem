atzmon gilad atzmon jazz artistworld musiclive datesauthorthoughtsjewish identitypoliticsathens  jerusalemthe wandering who welcome to gilad atzmons webpage this site provides information about gilads musical and intellectual activity   the jewish state and gilad atzmon december      gilad atzmon by christopher bollynbook review the wandering who  a study of jewish identity politics by gilad atzmon zero books   zionism has failed for various reasons zionism could never have prevailed it has been entangled with an endless list of sins from day one gilad atzmon the wandering whogilad atzmon is a gifted and articulate israeli dissident who presents a rather grim but realistic prognosis of zionism and the jewish state in his book the wandering who – a study of jewish identity politics  atzmon’s critique of jewish identity politics zionism and israel is timely reading given the collapse of the israeli government over a controversial law that would redefine the state of israel as the nationstate of the jewish people”the fundamental question about the proposed “jewish state” law is this will it promote peace given the violent reaction to the proposal of the bill it seems obvious that it will not solve any of the pressing political problems in palestine and would only exacerbate the very real tension between jews and palestinians in the holy land if it were adopted into lawaccording to atzmon it is precisely the ethnocentric notion that israel should be “the jewish state” which prevents it from being a normal and peaceful nationisrael is the jewish state and jewishness is an ethnocentric ideology driven by exclusiveness exceptionalism racial supremacy and a deep inherent inclination toward segregation for israel and israelis to become people like other people all traces of jewish ideological superiority must be eliminated first for the jewish state to lead a peace initiative israel must be dezionised – it should first stop being the jewish state i happened to meet gilad atzmon when our paths crossed in portland oregon in september i had the chance to talk to him and wanted to ask him if he was related to menachem atzmon the key israeli defendant in the  tort litigation gilad was quick to answer and said that he is indeed related to menachem atzmonmenachem atzmon is a former likud party cotreasurer who along with ehud olmert was charged with illegal campaign financing in israel although atzmon had been working with ehud olmert atzmon was convicted while olmert was not olmert the former mayor of jerusalem and prime minister has since been convicted and sentenced to prison on other charges involving accepting illegal funds   atzmon went on to head an israeli security company called international consultants on targeted security icts which is based in holland icts happens to be the parent company of huntleigh usa the former american company that managed passenger screening operations at boston’s logan airport on  icts was the key defendant in the  tort litigation but was excused from the process by a decision of the federal judge alvin k hellerstein it should be noted that there was a blatant conflict of interest in judge hellerstein’s management of the  tort litigation while judge hellerstein was overseeing the tort litigation his son joseph was living in israel on an illegal settlement and working in a law firm that represented the parent company of ictsgilad not only confirmed that he was related to menachem atzmon but added that he is also related to nathan friedmanyellin aka nathan yellinmor the zionist activist from grodno who worked closely with avraham stern and migrated to palestine in  to found lehi the radical jewish terrorist group also known as the stern gangafter sterns death yellinmor became the political leader of lehi along with yitzhak shamir operations and israel eldad propaganda yellinmor was one of the planners of the assassination in cairo of lord moyne the british minister of state in the middle east in november  yellinmor was also found guilty of “leadership of a terrorist organization” after lehi assassins murdered the swedish count folke bernadotte who was serving as united nations emissary in jerusalem in september  although yellinmor and lehi member matityahu “matty” shmuelevitz were found guilty on january   and yellinmor was sentenced to  years imprisonment both terrorists were pardoned shortly after the trial terrorist assassins nathan friedman yellinmor center and matty shmuelevitz left in  after being pardoned for having murdered the swedish count folke bernadotte the un special envoy to palestine in september  yellinmor then joined the first knesset government of israel shmuelevitz shares the family name with the mother of rahm emanuel  emanuels father benjamin auerbach emanuel was also a member of the terrorist lehi group and married marsha smulevitz there is a resemblance in the face of matty and rahm emanuel shmuelevitz went on the be the chiefofstaff for menachem begin matty shmuelevitz served as the director general of begins office  i would guess that matty is the man on the far left in this photo from   at this point the plans for  had already begun and the stage was being set in the united states for the biggest falseflag terror attack in history  if rahm emanuel is related to matty shmuelevitz as i suggest then we can understand the role emanuel played in setting the stage during the clinton administrations when he served as a special advisor to the presidentso when gilad atzmon says that zionism has “been entangled with an endless list of sins from day one” he knows what he is talking about he does not hide the fact that he was raised in a family that is tied to jewish terrorism as he says in the opening lines of his bookmy grandfather was a charismatic poetic veteran zionist terrorist a former prominent commander in the rightwing irgun terror organization…his familys relationship to zionist terrorism gives gilad atzmon’s perspective an authenticity that is lacking in much of the literature about zionism and israel atzmon is more than just another critical israeli who grew up during the time of the sixday war  the yom kippur war  and the invasion of lebanon  – his ancestors are among the key terrorists behind the creation of the state of israel and as we now know one of his relatives played a key role in the falseflag terrorism of  atzmon’s insights about israel and jewish identity politics come from a dissident who was raised in a family of dedicated zionists this is why i think his critique of zionism is one of the essential books of our time most americans have very little if any understanding of what zionism means in reality although their government is the most important financier and political supporter of the “jewish state” this lack of understanding is intentional of course the history of israel is not taught in our universities and our controlled media presents an utterly false image of what zionism is all aboutif the history of zionism were taught at our universities atzmon’s book would certainly be on the reading list because it is the voice of an honest and articulate israeli dissidentas a young israeli i believed in the zionist ethos i regarded myself an inherent part of the jewish modern revival project i saw myself as part of jewish history and jewish history as an extension of myself as a young israeli growing up in the post era i saw myself and the people around me as an evolving collective consciousness fighting a revolutionary battle for historic justice…as a young secular israeli jew i believed enthusiastically in the possibility of transformation of the jewish character into a ‘civilised authentic humanist collective’ i believed myself to be one i then grasped through a long and painful process that israel wouldn’t bring about a humanist jew it was entangled in a colossal sin and it was far too arrogant to save itself from its doomed circumstancesalthough the us government is the primary supporter of the state of israel and the assembled members of congress gave twentynine standing ovations to its extreme rightwing prime minister most americans jews and gentiles alike function with “an imaginary israel” in their mind something that they want to believe in but which bears no resemblance to reality as i often say about naïve apologists for israel they simply do not understand the nature of the beast this is why i find the following extract from atzmon’s book to be the most important it explains in plain english the essence of “the jewish state”one may be left perplexed on learning that just three years after the liberation of auschwitz  the newlyformed jewish state ethnically cleansed the vast majority of the indigenous population of palestine  just five years after the end of world war two the jewish state brought to life raciallydiscriminatory return laws in order to prevent the  palestinian refugees from coming back to their cities villages fields and orchards these laws still in place today were not categorically different from the notorious nazi nuremberg lawsthese are the essential facts about “the jewish state” that need to be taken into consideration when we discuss the state of israel the wellwritten atzmon critique is contained in a small book of about  pages yet he manages to deftly handle all of the main issues of jewish identity politics and zionism with intelligence and humorthere is one point where atzmon and i do not agree in several places he says “i do not believe in jewish conspiracies everything is done in the open i on the other hand think that a great deal of zionist planning is done in secret societies like the b’nai b’rith the parent organization of the antidefamation league adl and hillel the zionist planning of the falseflag terrorism of  for example was clearly done behind closed doors in a secret society where oaths of secrecy have been sworn  such secret societies exist for a reason and secrecy is the most important aspect of such organizationsi asked gilad about this statement and told him that my reading of zionist history revealed that secret societies like the bnai moshe bnai brith and others played key roles in creating the zionist fervor in eastern europe in the late s and beyond one source in particular the encyclopedia of zionism and israel by raphael patai herzl press  has many articles about these secret societies he wrote back agreeing that this “could be an open subject to debate” sources  atzmon

fraudmoney laundering with us stock frauds  was anders behring breivik norway terrorism funded by cia or israeli fraudmoney laundering with us penny stocks  i ask this question in light of antiwarcom libertarian blogger justin raimondo recent  mention  in his blog that  anders behring breivik claims to have been the managing director of ecommerce group as which is described as a part investment company –  part salesoutsourcing company –  with a total of  employees  in norway  in russia  in indonesia  in romania  in the us   for whom the nobel tollsbarack obamalondon norway    for whom the nobel tollsbarack obamalondon norway      below is brief quote and link to  one of the most  informative blogs i came across while researching the recent mass murder and terrorism in norway by anders behring breivikto anyone who took seriously barack barry soetoro obamas pretense of concern or phony offer of help i would remind them of his lie about connecting the dots immediately following the flight  crotch bomber incident involving the failed security at shipol airport amsterdam when he and his handlers and  the entire usgovernment and rupert murdoch fox and cnn and cnbcas well as zionist and right wing elite controlled newspapers and media  from  coast to coastetc suppressed all mentiion of the fact that it was once again convictedin israelmoney launderer menachem atzmon and his shin bet boys of icts international that the netherlands queen beatrixgeert wilders and the rothschild crime family alowed and continue to allow to control all security at shipol who allowed the isla nigerian crotch bomber to board flight  from amsterdam to detroit on christmas  in the first place  for any country that must depend upon the usgovernment or the uk lords of london and the rothschilds and their israeli henchman for security all i can say is may the lordrothschildhave mercy on your soulswhich is highly unlikely im sorry to say that had he been born  in amerikkka mr anders behring breivik would probably be one of our most influential and powerful politicians by now tony ryals       httpdeenfeedscompamelagellerandcoconnectedtonorwaybomberandersbehringbreivik     oslo bombing suspect anders behring breivik we’ve been screaming from the top of our lungs about how these crazed radical antimuslim islamophobes are inciting violence through their hatemongering anders behring breivak arrested as a suspect in the attack has written glowingly of geert wilders robert spencer sioe and the edl charles johnson of lgf reports that he had a link with fjordman who was a guest writer on geller’s blog terrorism in europe has been over linked to an islamic muslim threat even though we reported on how exaggerated the claim was europol report all muslims are terrorists…except the  that aren’t what just happened in oslo norway updates motherjones this explainer is being updated as more news emerges click here for photos from the sceneand here for details about the man arrested in connection with the attacks for the latest news updates click here the basics a massive explosion hit norway’s government hub in central oslo on friday killing at least seven people and injuring at least  others the sixstory building that was most heavily damaged included the oil ministry and is next to the building that houses the office of prime minister jens stoltenberg the pm was unharmed in the blast and is now operating out of an undisclosed location witness testimony and damage at the scene are consistent with reports of a car bombing the new york times reports stunned office staff and civil servants working in the vicinity of the bombed building said two explosions could be heard in close succession the sound of the blasts echoed across the city just before  pm local time giant clouds of lightcolored smoke continued to rise hundreds of feet into the air over the city… photos and television footage showed windows blown out in the story office building across the street from the oil ministry and the street and plaza areas on each side were strewn with glass and debris     my comment the gates of vienna website has defended their side by dismissing and probably successfully debunking the claim that anders behring breivak is really the alias fjordman who in truth i know nothing about as i am not a follower of his tiradeshowever the more important points you are making are that this is a mute point in light of the fact that anders breivak’s points of view are so similar to the internet alias fjordman’s views that they are indistinguishable and in fact one might say that fjordman’s as well as geert wilders’etal’s views are mirrors or vice versa of the views ofanders breivakand if this is the case and i would have to say that is undeniable at this pointthen indeed anders breivak has to be seen as a zionist or pro zionistiesame differencenone that said what has the present norwegian government done to set him off  i only noticed in searching this wingnut site called brusselsjournalcom that equates a norwegian consumer boycott of israeli products with war with friends like norway who needs enemies  the brussels journal httpwwwbrusselsjournalcomnode – cached jan  – last thursday kristin halvorsen  the norwegian minister of finance said that she is in favour of boycotting israel … …………………………………………… and i’m not sure if norway has withdrawn these investments since the article below but i do know they were attacked by israeli finance minister and money launderer avigdor liebermann who some claim anders breivik may also be an admirer ofnorway’s divestment from the israeli military industrial corporation elbit particularly rubbed him and his fellow israeli white wingnuts who erroneously claim to be ‘semites’the wrong waybut most recently norway has said it is withdrawing from nato’s war crimes and mass bombing campaign in libya which may have been the ‘breaking point’certainly if norway has a militant far right in norway capable of hating fellow citizens who do not tow their pro zionist views then it is just as likely that they also have pro wingnut zionist on the inside of their government as well which is the only way of explaining the norwegian goverment being suckered into participating in the uk’s the french sarkosey’s and the us and nato’s fascist actions in libya in the the first place  if i were norwegian i would look a lot closer at these british right wing elites and and france’s sarkosey and barack barry soetoro obama they gave a nobel to and ask myself if i really trusted ‘friends’ such as themmaybe norway could call for a real  investigation from barry soetoro or barack obama who they gave a nobel to in the first place and from their ‘allies’ in the ukwho are so anxious to ‘help’ them now in their hour of tragedy to take a new look at the london bombings of after all the norwegians and their government can easily verify that the the israelis of icts international who guarded logan airport boston on  also have ties to both the uk where they appear to have played a role in rail ‘security’ at the time of the london subway bombings and even now they control geert wilders’ and queen batrix’ and i believe the rothschild’s shiphol airport in amsterdam that allowed that nigerian islamic ‘crotch bomber’ farouk abdul mutallab to board flight  of christmas  in route for detroit that set off all those draconian plane searches in both the us and europe in lest we forgot  and farouk abdul mutallab father is ‘coincidentally’ a major israeli arms dealer in his country of nigeria  i placed articles with links below to document most of my statements above as well as an article i wtrote regarding obnamageert wilders and menachem atzmon and the israelis of icts international who guard shiphol airport even after all their outrages stock frauds and security frauds including it appears a role ‘security’ during the january moscow airport bombing  i wish in light of this most recent tragedy that instead of the uk fascists playing ‘big brother’ to the norwegians that noray would go on the moral offensive and take them as well as geert wilders’ and queen beatrix’s holland to task for allowing icts to continue tp provide ‘security’ for all europeans and others unfortunate enmough to have to pass through shipol airport in the netherlands
