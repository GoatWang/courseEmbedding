pricing how to price your products pricing a product is probably the toughest thing there is to do according to an expert heres how to tackle it by elizabeth wasserman elizabeth wasserman is editor of incs technology website inctechnologycom based in the washington dc area she has more than  years experience writing about business technology and politics for newspapers magazines and websites her work has appeared in such publications as congressional quarterly business week portfolio and slate  comments credit getty images one of the secrets to business success is pricing your products properly price your products correctly and that can enhance how much you sell creating the foundation for a business that will prosper get your pricing strategy wrong and you may create problems that your business may never be able to overcomeits probably the toughest thing there is to do says charles toftoy associate professor of management science at george washington university its part art and part sciencethere are a variety of different types of pricing strategies in business however theres no one surefire formulabased approach that suits all types of products businesses or markets pricing your product usually involves considering certain key factors including pinpointing your target customer tracking how much competitors are charging and understanding the relationship between quality and price the good news is you have a great deal of flexibility in how you set your prices thats also the bad newsthe following pages will detail how to meet your business goals in pricing products what factors to consider when pricing and how to determine whether or raise or lower your prices dig deeper how to profit from market researchhow to price your products meeting business goalsget clear about making moneythe first step is to get real clear about what you want to achieve with your pricing strategy you want to make money thats why you own a business making money means generating enough revenue from selling your products so that you can not only cover your costs but take a profit and perhaps expand your businessthe biggest mistake many businesses make is to believe that price alone drives sales your ability to sell is what drives sales and that means hiring the right sales people and adopting the right sales strategy the first thing you have to understand is the selling price is a function of your ability to sell and nothing else says lawrence l steinmetz coauthor of how to sell at margins higher than your competitors  winning every sale at full price rate or fee wiley  and a business consultant in boulder colo for  years whats the difference between an  rolex and a  seiko watch the seiko is a better time piece its far more accurate¦ the difference is your ability to sellat the same time be aware of the risks that accompany making poor pricing decisions there are two main pitfalls you can encounter  under pricing and over pricing   under pricing pricing your products for too low a cost can have a disastrous impact on your bottom line even though business owners often believe this is what they ought to do in a down economy accurately pricing your product is critical at any point in the economic cycle but no more so than in a recession says laura willett a small business consultant and faculty member in the finance department at bentley college in waltham mass many businesses mistakenly under price their products attempting to convince the consumer that their product is the least expensive alternative hoping to drive up volume but more often than not it is simply perceived as cheap remember that consumers want to feel that they are getting their moneys worth and most are unwilling to purchase from a seller they believe to have less value willett says businesses also need to be very careful that they are fully covering their costs when pricing products reducing prices to the point where you are giving away the product will not be in the firms best interest long term willett says over pricing on the flip side overpricing a product can be just as detrimental since the buyer is always going to be looking at your competitors pricing willett says  pricing beyond the customers desire to pay can also decrease sales toftoy says one pitfall is that business people will be tempted to price too high right out of the gate they think that they have to cover all the expenses of people who work for them the lease etc and this is what price it takes to do all that he says put yourself in the customers shoes what would be a fair price to you he advises taking little surveys of customers with two or three questions on an indexcardsized form asking them whether the pricing was fair understand your other business prioritiesthere are other reasons to go into business understand what you want out of your business when pricing your products aside from maximizing profits it may be important for you to maximize market share with your product  that may help you decrease your costs or it may result in what economists call network effects ie the value of your product increases as more people use it a great example of a product having network effect is microsofts windows operating system when more people began to use windows over rival products more software developers made applications to run on that platformyou may also want your product to be known for its quality rather than just being the cheapest on the market if so you may want to price your product higher to reflect the quality during a downturn you may have other business priorities such as sheer survival so you may want to price your products to recoup enough to keep your company in business dig deeper how to price business services how to price your products factors to consider there are many methods available to determine the right price willett says but successful firms use a combination of tools and know that the key factor to consider is always your customer first the more you know about your customer the better youll be able to provide what they value and the more youll be able to chargeknow your customerundertaking some sort of market research is essential to getting to know your customer willett says this type of research can range from informal surveys of your existing customer base that you send out in email along with promotions to the more extensive and potentially expensive research projects undertaken by third party consulting firms market research firms can explore your market and segment your potential customers very granularly  by demographics by what they buy by whether they are price sensitive etc if you dont have a few thousand dollars to spend on market research you might just look at consumers in terms of a few distinct groups  the budget sensitive the convenience centered and those for whom status makes a difference then figure out which segment youre targeting and price accordinglyknow your costsa fundamental tenet of pricing is that you need to cover your costs and then factor in a profit that means you have to know how much your product costs you also have to understand how much you need to mark up the product and how many you need to sell to turn a profit remember that the cost of a product is more than the literal cost of the item it also includes overhead costs overhead costs may include fixed costs like rent and variable costs like shipping or stocking fees you must include these costs in your estimate of the real cost of your product come up with x first x is your cost of raw materials labor rent and everything it took to make the product so that if you sold it you would break even advises toftoy y becomes what you think you need to make on it that may depend on your business restaurants overall make about  percent which is pretty low if you want  percent then you factor that into your costs and that is what you chargemany businesses either dont factor in all their costs and under price or literally factor in all their costs and expect to make a profit with one product and therefore overcharge a good rule of thumb is to make a spread sheet of all the costs you need to cover every month which might include the following your actual product costs including labor and the costs of marketing and selling those products all of the operating expenses necessary to own and operate the business the costs associated with borrowing money debt service costs your salary as the owner andor manager of the business a return on the capital you and any other owners or shareholders have invested capital for future expansion and replacement of fixed assets as they age list the dollar amount for each on your spreadsheet the total should give you a good idea of the gross revenues you will need to generate to ensure you cover all those costsknow your revenue target you should also have a revenue target for how much of a profit you want your business to make take that revenue target factor in your costs for producing marketing and selling your product and you can come up with a price per product that you want to charge if you only have one product this is a simple process estimate the number of units of that product you expect to sell over the next year then divide your revenue target by the number of units you expect to sell and you have the price at which you need to sell your product in order to achieve your revenue and profit goalsif you have a number of different products you need to allocate your overall revenue target by each product then do the same calculation to arrive at the price at which you need to sell each product in order to achieve your financial goalsknow your competition its also helpful to look at the competition  after all your customer most likely will too are the products offered comparable to yours  if so you can use their pricing as an initial gauge willett suggests then look to see whether there is additional value in your product do you for example offer additional service with your product or is your good of perceived higher quality  if so you may be able to support a higher price  be cautious about regional differences and always consider your costsit may even be worthwhile to prepare a headtohead comparison of the price of your products to your competitors products the key here is to compare net prices not just the list or published price this information could come from phone calls secret shopping published data etc make notes during this process about how your company and products  and the competition  are perceived by the market be brutally honest in your evaluationknow where the market is headedclearly you cant be a soothsayer but you can keep track of outside factors that will impact the demand for your product in the future these factors can range from something as simple as longterm weather patterns to laws that may impact future sales of your products also take into account your competitors and their actions will a competitor respond to your introduction of a new product on the market by engaging your business in a price war dig deeper when customers grumble about price hikes how to price your products deciding to raise or lower prices one size does not fit all you can only go so far pricing all your products based on a fixed markup from cost  your product price should vary depending on a number of factors including what the market is willing to pay how your company and product are perceived in the market what your competitors charge whether the product is highly visible and frequently shopped and compared the estimated volume of product you can sell that opens the door to raising andor lowering prices for your products in order to make this call one way or the other you should first understand whats already working analyze the profitability of your existing products so you can do more of what works and stop doing what doesnt work you want to find out which of your existing products are making money and which are losing money you may be surprised at how many of your products are losing money  fix those asapyou should also constantly reevaluate your costs to sell it right you have to buy it right if you are having a hard time selling a product at an acceptable profit the problem may be that you are not buying the product right it may be that your cost is too high rather than your price is too lowwhen to raise prices  and howyou should always be testing new prices new offers and new combinations of benefits and premiums to help you sell more of your product at a better price test new offers each month raise the price and offer a new and unique bonus or special service for the customer measure the increase or decrease in the volume of the product you sell and the total gross profit dollars you generateit is a fact of life in business that you will have to raise prices from time to time as part of managing your business prudently if you never raise your prices you wont be in business for long you have to constantly monitor your price and your cost so that you are both competitive in the market and you make the kind of money you deserve to makethe best way to determine if the product is being priced correctly is to watch sales volumes immediately after making any change willett says this can be done by watching cash collections if the business is cash or credit card based or credit sales if accounts receivables are used for the weeks following if a price increase is too high customers will react pretty quickly  also watching the competition can help  if youve made a positive change in prices competitors are likely to follow suitbut there is a right way and a wrong way to raise prices you dont want to alienate your existing customer base by raising prices too steeply especially during a recession rather than have a sudden increase have a strategic plan over two to five years during which you gradually increase your price  to  percent toftoy advices if the business is in trouble and you say hey im going to mark everything up¦ that kind of scares people away this way you havent gone from  to  youve gone to  firstin terms of raising the price  this is more easily accepted in good economic times willett says as the underlying cost of producing the product rises the customer is prepared to accept the rise in the price to them  if the customer perceives that the firms costs are going down while their price is going up this will not be received well and is likely to backfirewhen to lower prices  and howyou may realize that you have missed your target audience by pricing your products too high you can always choose to discount your products or give customers something for free in order to get them to try your product or generate traffic to your storefront or website you have to get people in toftoy says people like getting something for free or some kind of discount you can make wednesday senior citizen day when seniors get a  percent discount then maybe you can offer a student discount day then all youre doing is keeping the price the same but to those people youre giving them a cut but its not like youve lowered all pricesgenerally lowering prices is not a good practice unless you are using this strategically to garner market share and have a price sensitive product or if all of your competitors are lowering their prices willett says an alternative to lowering price is to offer less for the same price which will effectively reduce your costs without appearing to reduce the value to the customer she says restaurants have found this particularly helpful in terms of portion sizes but this same strategy can be applied to service industries as wellmonitor your pricinganother key component to pricing your product right is to continuously monitor your prices and your underlying profitability on a monthly basis its not enough to look at overall profitability of your company every month you have to focus on the profitability or lack of profitability of every product you sell you have to make absolutely sure you know the degree to which every product you sell is contributing to your goal of making money each month remember people respect what you inspecthere are some other practices to help you price right listen to your customers try to do this on a regular basis by getting feedback from customers about your pricing let them know you care about what they think keep an eye on your competitors if you dont have deep pockets and cant afford to hire a market research team hire some college students to go out on a regular basis and monitor what your competitors are doing have a budget action plan in place try to have a plan for your pricing that extends out three to six months in the future you owe it to yourself and to your business to be relentless in managing your product pricing remember how you set the

you should always know how far is too far with product expansion by michael alter michael alter is the chief executive officer of the tie bar llc previously michael was a cofounder and ceo of surepayroll a saas technology company that is now a wholly owned subsidiary of paychex® michaelalter ceo the tie barmichaelalter write a comment credit getty images the age old question that keeps many an entrepreneur up at night is whether to expand into new categories or if you should stick to what has already proven successful there is compelling research for larger companies that seems to indicate that in most cases keeping your product assortment within a narrow band of what you know is best over time hbr article janfeb   the grass isnt greener  evan hirsh and kasturi rangan for smaller businesses that are starting out or just hitting their growth stride i wish the answer was as clear cut i find that the answer always depends and truly can change based on individual circumstances as such here are  things to think about when considering if and how far to expand your product category breadthdo you have a natural right to win  is it logical for you to offer it meaning will your customers understand and believe you are credible in that category at the tie bar we have expanded into other mens accessories such as socks and belts with great success we probably could expand into offering other mens products down the line but it wouldnt seem logical for us to move into accessories that are marketed primarily to women you should always know your overall brand standards and stick to themdo you have the right knowledge  just because the product makes sense in an internal brainstorm doesnt mean you can always pull it off without hurting your overall brand or customer experience testing and learning is a great way to figure this out as is hiring an expert in that area to help lead your expansion dont underestimate the learning curve when developing and launching into a new product category practice makes perfect and wont always immediately pan out the way you want it todoes it complement your current business  can you leverage aspects of your current business like selling to your core customer base utilizing your existing supply chain or promoting on your existing retail channels and platformsdo you really understand the economics  new categories present opportunities to grow and learn however you need to make sure you really understand the economics of the new category will you be able to make sufficient margin and dollar profit as an example when the tie bar considers the possibility of expanding into other mens product areas we need to consider the economics of a much higher return rate than ties factors like fit in relation to the overall customer satisfaction and the added cost to either liquidate a return or recondition for future sale must be taken into considerationdo you need to pivotexpand to survivesometimes you are just in a dying business and you need to pivot and add new categories to survive consider the example of the old bankrupted horse and carriage manufacturers who should have realized they were in the transportation business and not the buggy business or in more recent times the folks like blockbuster video or borders that could have pivoted into new categories when they had the chance but missed their opportunity and only suffered for itif these types of decisions were easy or obvious you could follow a prescribed formula or checklist we would not need smart entrepreneurs and leaders to grow and build our businesses for many years to come my tips above are just the top  that i personally consider and the tip of the iceberg for this debate i am curious what other factors you

a web site containing photos of beautiful hardwood furniture the consider h willett company of louisville kentucky when have you ever made a better investmentfrom a tag on a willett furniture piece i am a kentucky transplant and what i know about willett furniture is based on what local people have told me the consider h willett furniture company was located in louisville kentucky and i believe made furniture from the late s into the s the furniture was at the peak of popularity from the late s into the early and mid s deep cherry furniture never seems to go out of fashion in the southeast a lot of willett furniture was sold in central kentucky and it sold quite well in the comparatively wealthy bluegrass region at central kentucky auctions the name willett is well recognized and the pieces probably command higher prices than in states further north where the furniture is not as well known and there is less of a following the furniture was never cheap it was manufactured furniture rather than handmade but the pieces were always very carefully crafted and were made of solid hardwoods most often cherry but sometimes in maple as well a piece of say cherry furniture from willett was made of solid cherry inside and outno veneers plywood particle board or any other cheap material even in interior places like drawer pieces they were also famous for their handrubbed finishes particularly on cherry which often gave a glasslike polished but almost threedimensional transparent depth to the wood rather than appearing as a finish on the top of the wood unlike many of the finishes now appearing on newlymade cherry furniture many pieces have a pressed metal medallion on them identifying them as willett and what particular design line they are from for example my buffet drop leaf table and chairs are from the wildwood line which if the pieces coming up for sale are any indication was by far the most popular and became the trademark collection some of the maple pieces apparently were also tagged the golden beryl marking was often used on the maple pieces the trademark cherry line featured what is often referred to as a rope motif which was a spiral carving that appeared on dropleaf table legs as trim on the sides of buffets chests and vanities and even on horizontal pieces on poster beds dining chairs and benches the vanity illustrated in the photo below illustrates the many different ways in which the spiral rope motif appeared on some furniture pieces i am convinced that early on this was basically the only design willett used for their cherry furniture pieces and these pieces are generally tagged as wildwood wildwood pieces with drawers buffets dressers and similar often have a metal plate with the wildwood name attached to the inside of one of the drawers some of the pieces also have the willett name stamped with red ink as illustrated here my dropleaf table has a large willett wildwood marking stamped with red ink on the underside of the center of the top chairs often bear no marking at all upholstered chairs probably had a paper tag stapled underneath but these tags were usually removed when the chair fabric was changed later on into the late s the company added other collections with some different styling themes these moved away from the rope motif but the rope motif furniture was still being manufactured and that furniture ultimately became the wildwood collection but the confusing part is that some of the pieces that do not have the same trim details as those that used the rope turnings still were labeled wildwood and some even have the metal wildwood tag see photos of markings below in cherry the other collections included elswick marblehead transitional transeast and countryside there were a smaller number of collections in maple the golden beryl brownleigh and the lancaster county collection are mentioned in advertisements there are fewer pieces of willett furniture now coming up for sale in these other designs in part because they never reached the popularity of the original rope motif design but also because these other collections were manufactured for a much shorter period of time late in the history of the company for example an ad below introduces the new transitional collection in a  better homes and gardens by  the company was out of business in contrast the company was producing the rope motif design with the wildwood logo basically from the start  to the point in time when the company was liquidated also given the relative numbers of pieces now up for auction the maple furniture was never anywhere near as popular as the cherry pieces but the labeling becomes even more complex rebecca beatty tells me that her newlyacquired pewter cabinet photo below despite not having the rope design trim and having a different style of door panel i call it the swaytop design than the rope motif pieces have still is labeled willett wildwood my guess is that this piece was made sometime between  and  apparently it was only rather late in the company history that the wildwood name became one specific collection with the rope motif ladies from wellto do kentucky families and throughout the south in the s and s loved to buy willett pieces to blend in with antique and family pieces passed down through the generations and the cherry pieces were the logical choice kentucky women and for that matter many women in the south have long favored dark cherry furniture in traditional styles even when it was out of favor in other parts of the country and so that often constituted much of their business the pieces today arent ultra expensive but prices appear to be rising a few years ago i purchased the large sideboardbuffet with the rope motif at a local antiques dealer for  when i got it home and could look at the condition and construction quality i concluded that i had gotten quite a bargain rebecca beatty tells me she saw the same buffet at the louisville antiques mall in excellent original condition the asking price was  in october  i completed a deal with a lady in fort wayne indiana for the drop leaf table with the rope legs  side chairs and two arm chairs for  the table and chairs are also in excellent condition and the finish is so close to the finish on the buffet it could have come out of the factory on the same day this lady also had a china cabinet that is wider than the tall hutch which is also cherry and marked willett its design in a photo below does not have the rope motif but is consistent with one of the other collections just before this i went to the local auction house where the drop leaf table also in excellent condition was bid to  and  roseback side chairs went for  each they also sold the rope motif tall hutch which was bid to  what is interesting is that the auctioneer estimated the drop leaf table to bring  and each chair to bring  he was off by a factor of almost  swains furniture in southern illinois a company that sells on ebay has a wildwood cherry rope motif set consisting of the drop leaf table  side chairs two arm chairs the tall hutch and the buffet identical to mine that they would be willing to sell for  tho as of the last auction there have been no takers at this price the pieces appear to be in good but not excellent condition another ebay seller in new england recently had a very beautiful pristine arch window cherry corner cupboard marked willett wildwood this sold on ebay for  the cherry ropeleg dropleaf tables must have been very popular with buyers and apparently more of these were made than any other willett item a dropleaf dining room table should bring between  and perhaps even moreat a sale depending on whether the finish is original or not and the overall condition of the table willett was a master finisher of cherry and a considerable portion of the value of any willett piece is in this original finish if the finish is not original the value would be in the lower end of this range perhaps  an original finish table in nearpristine condition should be worth at least  regardless of the piece having the original finish represents perhaps   maybe more of the value of the piece small nicks and scratches on the original finish do not seriously detract from value but a nonoriginal finish does the fact that many antique dealers buy willett pieces at estate sales tells something about what is happening with respect to collector interest i have seen willett cherry finished in a lighter cherry finish that is more golden rather than deep red i am not certain if this was a factory finish however my drop leaf table and the one on swains has a  inch leaf and a cut in the middle of the table to accept the leaf the leaf i have for mine is still in the original willett cardboard box with a large willett logo on it the table auctioned locally had a one piece center and no leaf but otherwise are identical in size and in design these tables without he cut for the leaf have also been regularly auctioned on ebay so far i have seen or heard of six or seven different chair designs as illustrated in the photos below and i am interested in learning if there are others as well the back designs differ considerably most of them are of modest size with fairly low backs some of the chair designs have the rope motifothers do not the chairs at the local auction were the so called rose chairs with a large carved rose an the top of the back my chairs look more contemporary and have no carving or rope trim but the center slat is in the shape of a vase or urn the arm chairs have curved arms with a spiral the backs on the swain chairs appear to be more of a lyre shapewith a decorative hole cut in the middle of the center slat i would describe this as a decorative lyre back i am confident that all of these chair designs are genuine willett see photos below there are at least  chair designs that feature the rope motif one has the rope pattern on the top horizontal slat another design features a small padded back with a horizontal slat featuring the rope motif below still another design features the rope motif on the legs these chairs are illustrated in the photos below these were undoubtedly the chairs designed to go with the drop leaf and other pieces with the rope motif but interestingly most of the buyers appear to have chosen one of the other chair designs as they are more often seen at sales apparently buyers having chosen the table would then choose from a number of different chair designs to suit their particular preferences i am wondering if there are still other chair designs out there that were sold with the drop leaf table a photo below shows a chair design with a mixture of windsor and early american influences and the owner claimed that these chairs were also manufactured by willett another writer tells me that she also has willett chairs of a very similar design these may be part of the marblehead collection as illustrated in the brochure below sue hayes writes i bought a table does not accept an extra leaf a sideboardbuffet without the rope inserts and a piece that was described by the sellers as a jackson press it has the rope inserts on each side and doors toward the bottom with drawers above i also bought a serving cart and a wall mirror that has willett wildwood cherry on the back there was a printed card in one of the buffet drawers that had consider h willett inc louisville  kentucky on it it described a little of their manufacturing process and the care that should be given to the furniture it ended with the question when have you ever made a better investment i have been able to verify that the table and all of the chairs are indeed stamped willett and the name of the grouping is countryside  and from the new owner of the coffee table pictured below i recently purchased a willett cherry double size poster bed in colorado through a classified ad i liked the quality and workmanship and looked for the brand when i was on ebay one day i am the one that purchased the drop leaf coffee table from cairnes that you have on your website also i was very close to bidding on the corner cabinet commenti suspect that the coffee table the windsorearly american chairs and the oval drop leaf table are all from the countryside collection which was a different collection from the furniture that used the spiral rope motif while the pieces cant be classified as antiques they still are very fine and functional pieces of furniture and worthy of passing through the generations the furniture seems to be acquiring its own collectorfollowingpeople who are not concerned that it isnt old enough to be considered antique and who simply value the furniture for its beauty and construction quality a little willett history i am indebted to charles hudson of nicholasville kentucky who has provided some details about the history of the willett furniture company in kentucky based on clippings from louisville courier journal newspapers during the era from the august   issue consider h willett and his brother wr willett were in the lumber business when in  consider h founded the willett furniture co they were at the time of this writing the largest maker of cherry and maple furniture in the us the article gives a profit for the year  of  dollars by  standards this would have been a very successful company in terms of size earnings and profit in  they bought a plant in new albany ind for the manufacture of kitchen cabinets these were done in birch charles says he has only talked to one person who had these and he doubts if there are very many left intact apparently the kitchen cabinet business was less successful than the furniture business charles indicates to me that the firm got into serious financial difficulty in about  and between  and  the company changed hands in an effort to save the firm assets of the willett firm were auctioned in june  and the firm ceased operation at that time charles indicates that the furniture manufacturing equipment was simply sold off to bidders at the auction and that the detailed production drawings for each furniture piece were also auctioned off he believes that the drawings ended up in the hands of a furniture manufacturer somewhere in the eastern united states but so far as anyone knows no other manufacturer has attempted to continue to produce any of the pieces at least as of the year  the old willett factory is still standing it is on the corner of th and kentucky in louisville the willett name was still legible on the side of the brick charles also says the tag that came on our buffet says that it is my old kentucky home group this is the one with all the roped legs and turnings on the sides the  book lists three groupings of cherry my old kentucky homedining roomsallie ward group living room  and the kentuckiana group  bed room the maple is not named in groupings in the dining room grouping there are four styles of chairs i suspect what brought willett down was a combination of several factorslike many familyrun businesses there might not have been another generation committed to keeping the business operational and as the company changed hands new owners may not have fully appreciated what was involved though manufactured the furniture pieces required careful craftsmanship with lots of skilled hand work by what must have been becoming a very wellpaid workforce perhaps the careful craftsmanship materials  finish became less and less competitive pricewise with cheaper furniture constructed less carefully often in other countries with cheaper labor costs and of lesser materials and this could have led to a decline in sales finally by the late s the trend was definitely away from heavy dark traditional furniture as many people were tossing traditional furniture in favor of simple new contemporary designs with blonde finishes time wise the early s was certainly a low point in interest in traditional furniture with a lot of detail somehow the attempts to contemporize the furniture by eliminating details never quite worked with customers see photos of transitional and the somewhat orientallooking transeast line below the company still really wanted to make traditional furniture like they had in the past the late designs came off as neither traditional nor contemporary but some place in between perhaps the pieces were too modern looking for the traditional buyers but not contemporary enough for those who were purchasing new furniture in the late s and early s another clue is that the ads for willett furniture that are showing up at auction are almost always from the late s as the bhg ad introducing the transitional line i think this says something previously the traditional furniture may have been so popular that the companys major problem probably was keeping up with the demand especially given the complicated multistep finishing process that required skilled labor word of mouth worked better than any print advertizing campaign by the late s sales of the traditional pieces were declininghence all the new almost contemporary designs that appeared in the late s but the company also found it necessary to advertize in national magazines in an effort to boost sales something they had hardly done in the s and early s i had the following note from margaret willett ernest a relative of consider h willett  from the book abraham willett of onondaga county new york by albert james willett jr on p  the willett furniture company was eventually sold out of the family but continued under the willett name until at least  it went out of business in the s earlier on the same page the author said that it was a going concern in  consider heath willett jr died in  sincerely margaret willett ernest  im still trying to determine if the person who died in  was indeed the founder or perhaps instead a son who could have died in world war ii and if anyone has any more information on this i would appreciate hearing from them from owners of willett golden beryl maple pieces chuck holm in green bay wisconsin writes greetings david  i just discovered your website and am so thrilled to find other collectors of willett i am of the other family  i have golden beryl maple i grew up with this furniture and was always told of its quality i have redone my family room to look just like the living room of my childhood  with all the  maple i have the long drop dining room table hutch corner cabinet coffee table dropleaf end table and have just found a wonderful little writing desk my dining table and end table are in mint condition  not a single scratch i have a clock shop in green bay wisconsin we sell restoreafinish products by howard  i love them  better than old english scratch cover i have many collector cars and have a professional buffer and i took this to the top of the tables  they came out beautiful  a mirror finish  hard to believe for  year old pieces the coffee table was another story  really in bad shape  was in the basement for kids to play on with their toys i had to refinish it  but spent many hours using red oak stain and sprayed coats of hand rubbed lacquer to get it to look like the original finish it isnt easy anyway i would appreciate any information or leads on the golden beryl maple  i saw two s willett catalogs go on ebay last year  was that you who got them i was hoping that someone would have the same information on the maple as you have on the cherry i would love to communicate with you more on the willett  it has been a hobby of mine for many years to search it out in the antique malls auctions etc it would be fun to share stories with others and thanks for your wonderful website chuck holm green bay wisconsin connie conley noyes writes  i recently discovered that the beautiful table set my husbands grandmother gave us was made by willett i searched the internet for information on this furniture brand and your informative page came up the set has a total of  chairs grandmother still has the two that she calls captain chairs as she is using them the set is made of solid maple with golden beryl stamped under the extra leaves and the chairs when it is all put together it makes a very large table to accommodate several people however long legged people complain about there being too many table legs they cant comfortably fit their legs underneath the total counted is ten legs i cant find any stamping that will provide information on the style i will take a photo of this furniture and once the film is developed forward you the picture via email i am writing to thank you for the help you have provided me with the background of this furniture company i intend to clean and polish it by the directions mentioned in your web page thank you very much for them i was concerned about some nicks it had been stored in the attic of a house in illinois that my husbands grandparents lived in it was very exciting to learn that it was crafted in kentucky my paternal line comes from that fine state for several generations jackie whitney writes  i recently purchased a dining set at a resale shop with the consider h willett label it is a drop leaf table with  chairs one with arms i was concerned with the fact that there is a cigarette burn on the top should i try and remove it or just leave it i think it has its original finish all the pieces have labels and are numbered i am sending pictures feel free to display them on your site thank you for your time the pictures of the dining set are in the photos below i reply there are antique furniture restorers who specialize in dealing with small problems such as nicks scratches and cigarette burns i do not view these small problems as significantly detracting from the value of the piece if the finish is original and overall is in good condition if you do decide to have a repair made what you want is someone who can make a small repair to just the immediate area of the cigarette burn without altering the finish on the rest of the piece check your phone directory for furniture repair people particularly people who specialize in repair of antique furniture and see what type of repair they might suggest remember that as much as  of the value of your furniture is in the original finish so you will want whatever repairs are made to not affect the finish on the rest of the piece even if the spot from the burn cannot be completely eliminated i had a nice phone visit with barry goodall who is one of the dealers who buys and sells willett furniture at the louisville antiques mall httpwwwlouisvilleantiquesmallcom he reinforced a couple of points with me  with willett furniture condition largely determines value and having the original finish in nearly unblemished condition makes a piece much more valuable than having a nonoriginal finish even a nonoriginal finish in good condition  maple pieces are worth considerably less than cherry pieces of similar condition there is less maple out there but there are far fewer buyers looking for maple pieces a dropleaf table in maple might be worth  retail whereas the same table in cherry would likely bring  retail barry is always interested in buying and selling willett furniture or just visiting with people about willett furniture he has a number of the old willett dealer catalogs and can identify many of the pieces with respect to what collection they belong and he can be reached at   cherry collections i know of the following cherry collections built by willett each differs in some details wildwood this collection was built for a very long time and as a result the pieces are among the most readily available the most distinguishing feature is the rope or spiral rather than turned design that appears on table legs as trim on buffets dressers and as a feature on beds and horizontal chair slats its the design most commonly thought of as willett the drawers in this design features brass handles with backplates and the doors have panels with a single curved arch on the top marblehead the rope motif in this collection is absent and the door panels are square rather than cathedral im still trying to determine for certain if the fingerboard trim appears on marblehead buffets where the rope trim would appear on the wildwood collection legs on tables are ordinary not spiralturnings elswick the large breakfront in the photo below was identified as being part of the elswick collection the design is similar to the transitional line with rectangular panels in the doors one difference is the queene anne foot on the buffet whereas the transitional buffet had a short turned leg with a taper there are handles with backer plates on the drawers interestingly a grooved fingerboardlike piece appears in place of the rope trim on the buffet transitional this is the collection illustrated in the bhg ad above the legs are a simple variable radius turning and round pulls are used on both drawers and pulls transeast a recently had a call from a man in louisville who owns transeast pieces and the photos are now on the web site the design is similar to the transitional with different somewhat orientallooking brass pulls and trim countryside i have no information on design features of this collection in the photos below there are two mystery designs that are likely from one of the above collections the table and jackson press owned by sue hayes features a leg and trim design that is somewhat like the rope leg but is different too this is sometimes referred to as button trim further the jackson press has a rectangular flat rather than a raisedpanel door the other design features what i call the swayback door panel the top of the panel is curved but like the swayback of a horse i suspect all of the pieces featuring this design belong to another of the above collections but which one i dont now know please email me if you know anything about this obviously all of the pieces that have the door panels with the double sway maple collections i know of the following maple collections see photos below golden beryl lancaster county brownleigh no photos yet a sales brochure here is part of a sales brochure from the marblehead collection identifying various pieces more willett ads here are some pdf files of willett ads to download sent to me by jim morrow jim writesin november  my wife and i were in the market to purchase furniture for our apartment which we had rented furnished with rental furniture our tastes were different but after looking around we both agreed that we liked the willett transitional cherry we purchased living room dining room and bed room pieces which i still have in my possession only one piece that we purchased has been disposed of in over  years i was in the military and we made numerous moves over the years both during and after my retirement aside from short moves of    miles it has been shipped to puerto rico england and back and from east to west coast and back and is still in great shape with only minor scuff marks and dings none of it has ever been refinished i consider it a real tribute to the manufacturer that it has held up so well and to the movers for the care they showed in handling it in  we downsized from a large home to an apartment and had to dispose of some furniture we disposed of willett piece no  a  x  coffee table  bench which came with three cushions so that it could be used as a coffee table without the cushions or a cushioned bench for seating disposal was through an auction house the bench without the cushions went for  the cherry wood in the piece was worth more than that and it would have still been an excellent piece of cherry furniture with very little work after willett went out of business we were forced to get our cherry furniture from harden furniture and pennsylvania house but the willett has always had a special place in our home part  ad part  ad part  ad part  ad part  ad part  ad part  ad part  ad caring for your willett furniture i am getting questions on how to care for willett furniture in particular how to deal with chips and scratches appreciation is extended to sue hayes of dickson tennessee who also supplied me with a copy of the original care tag from a piece of her willett furniture below are the actual care instructions from the company when the furniture was delivered the first paragraph talks a bit about the manufacturing process that resulted in the famous willett finish which is a handrubbed finish perhaps most interesting is the admonition to use a paste wax rather than an oilbased polish undoubtedly a paste wax was used in the final stages of finishing at the manufacturing plant the problem with paste waxes is that they can build up over timeand collect grime leaving a sticky residue that must eventually be removed a lemon oil polish or similar furniture cleaner will remove this buildup and i have not observed any harm to the underlying finish the factory finish being  years old has had lots of time to harden and cure and the prime condition of many willett pieces attests to the longtern durability of the finish even for those who failed to heed all the advice in the above tag remember that willett was a master furniture finisher and the envy of many other manufacturers in this regard thus a considerable share of the value of your willett piece is in the original finish which would be difficult for a refinisher to duplicate furniture that is  years or more old should show some evidence that it did not just come out of a furniture store this means that small nicks scratches and other wear marks accumulated over time do not detract from value at least not in any significant way as a general rule the older the piece of furniture the more wear marks will have been accumulated many furniture manufacturers today are trying for the look that their recently manufactured pieces are not new but instead have been passed down through the generations often times furniture accumulates grime oil and wax that gives the wood a dingy appearance i would suggest using a good quality oilbased furniture cleaner applied with a soft cloth as a starting point for removing this grime i have had good luck with a furniture cleaner from holloway house i found right at the grocery store if you have particularly toughto remove grime try a product called desolveit available at lowesagain apply a little to a soft cloth once you have used the furniture cleaner a light coat of a liquid lemon oil applied with a soft cloth may be all that is needed if scratches are still visible try a light coat of the old english furniture polish that has the brown dye in it yup the same product your mother used is still readily available it works quite well on a lot of scratches in terms of hiding them if you have larger nicks and scratches i like to work those over with a product from minwax called wood sheen in one of the darker colors this comes in various colors though i tend to favor what they call colonial walnut which seems to work well on most darker woods i think there is a mahogany color that might work well on cherry furniture as well this is a tung oil based colored gellike product just put a little on a soft cloth and rub it on the scratch or chip and the area around it let it dry for an hour or so and buff out the area if the chipped area is not dark enough you can apply more coats allowing  hours drying time between each coat this goes right over the old finishits possible to refinish larger areas with this product too for circles left by glasses try rubbing out the area with a cloth that has some silver polish on itthen polish with lemon oil ive also had good luck with the product they sell in the automotive parts places for polishing alloy wheels its a very fine polishing compound some people swear by toothpaste too the willett finish tends to spot and dissolve with alcohol these types of spots can often be buffed so that they are less noticeable with any of these products followed by a coat of lemon oil professional furniture restorers sometimes use a few drops of alcohol on a soft cloth and lots of rubbing to melt some of the original finish into the damage spots but this is not a technique for amateur to attempt none of these techniques remove any of the original finish i would consider refinishing only if an entire section was peeling or otherwise in very bad condition and even there i would think twice before refinishing the entire piece once the wood is free of grime i wouldnt discourage anyone from following the manufacturers recommendation to apply a light coat of a top quality paste wax buffing out with a soft cloth and dont worry if you cant get a completely likenew look if that is the look you wanted you probably should have purchased new furniture part of the charm of owning older furniture is that the pieces have picked up some nicks and scratches over the yearsa finish that you cant buy in new furniture its only when the condition of the finish severely detracts from the beauty of the piece that this is any big deal a note from bernard z lee consider h willett company and its kitchen cabinet operation in new albany was bought by a houston texas investor named irvin d kaplan in the early s it was his intention to continue the operation of both companies however operating costs at the furniture company had gotten out of hand and the company was losing money in an effort to cure the problem negotiations were begun with the union seeking some concessions and cost reductions those efforts were getting no where and a decision was taken to liquidate the plan included the termination of manufacturing by completing whatever was in process but starting no new product that procedure took some weeks during which time the union continued negotiating but it was too late the plant and its operations had for all practical effects been shut down assuming a successful arrangement with the union could have been reached the cost of restarting manufacture was prohibitive and the liquidation was completed this is of a cherry wood night tableend
