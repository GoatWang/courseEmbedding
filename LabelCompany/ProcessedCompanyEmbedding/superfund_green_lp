units in the fund the offering of fund units can only be made by the prospectus which contains important information regarding certain risks associated with the fund and should be read carefully and retained by anyone considering an investment in the fund the units have not been approved or disapproved by the securities and exchange commission the commodity futures trading commission or any state securities commission nor has the securities and exchange commission the commodity futures trading commission or any state securities commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or this brochure managed futures can generally be defined as a globally diversified basket of futures contracts which are listed on worldwide exchanges futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes risk factors there can be no assurance that the investment objective of series a or series b of superfund green lp will be achieved investing in series a or series b of superfund green lp is speculative and investors must be prepared to lose all or a substantial amount of their investment both series a and series b of superfund green lp are highly leveraged which may potentially provide higher returns but also increase the overall risk and volatility of the investment costs and expenses of managed futures funds are significantly higher than mutual funds and other investment vehicles investors in both series a and series b of superfund green lp will realize taxable gains and losses in the year in which they occur and proper consideration should be given to the tax implications of an investment the profitability of funds that use trading systems that only analyze technical market data and not any economic factors external to market prices may be negatively affected when sustained price trends fail to develop superfund capital management the general partner of the fund has total trading authority over each series the use of a single advisor could mean lack of diversification and consequently higher risk the fund s charges are substantial and must be offset by trading gains and or gold investment profits and interest income in order to avoid depletion of each series assets there is no secondary market for the units and none is expected to develop you may redeem your units only as of a monthend transfers of units are subject to limitations there is no guarantee that these methods will be successful dear investor as an alternative investment strategy managed futures have attracted much attention in recent years why managed futures offer the potential for high absolute returns and their performance is historically independent of traditional portfolio components such as stocks bonds commodities and other alternative investment strategies discipline is the key to longterm investment success investing is a complex and often emotional topic for most investors as soon as greed for increased profits gains the upper hand healthy common sense disappears whether you are an individual investor or institutional fund manager therefore at christian baha superfund we have crystallized our investment discipline into an automated systematic approach to markets our system ensures that human emotions will not interfere with our approach to trading markets clear rules for market diversification trend analysis and risk management are applied consistently our fully automated trading systems perpetually screen about  financial and commodity markets around the world for investment possibilities the broad diversification of the traded markets improves the potential to find strong trends we attain this diversity not only by investing in stocks bonds or currencies but also by trading daily necessities such as energy metals and various agricultural products sincerely christian baha founder  what are futures how do the goods we buy on a daily basis make their way onto the supermarket shelves how are their prices determined one way is through global commodity futures exchanges these are important financial centers which provide buyers and sellers with a competitive marketplace and a forum to control price and risk at the same time a futures contract is a financial agreement to buy or sell a certain product for a fixed price at a predetermined date in the future in this way farmers can sell their wheat months before they even harvest it at a fixed price regardless of bad weather or crop disease the buyer bears the initial risk but is rewarded if the futures price comes in under the contract price for the commodity as the futures contract delivery date approaches the distance between the contract price and the final price will lessen an investment strategy in managed futures generally should be planned for a minimum of at least five years the growth of the managed futures industry in billion usd  through  source barclayhedge alternative investment database barclay hedge ltd time period   while managed futures offer such potential to profit this type of investment is highly volatile and speculative thus an investor must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of an investment what are managed futures managed futures are becoming an increasingly significant asset class distinct from stocks bonds and other alternative investment strategies managed futures can generally be defined as a globally diversified basket of futures contracts which are listed on worldwide exchanges managed futures funds have the ability to go both long and short and thus have the potential to profit in rising or falling markets moreover managed futures funds historically have had a low correlation to stocks bonds and other investments and therefore have the potential to improve returns and lower the overall volatility of a portfolio at the end of  institutional and private investors had approximately  billion invested in this asset class benefits of managed futures why investors are drawn to managed futures high performance potential the potential for high performance over a longterm investment period correlation the historically low correlation of managed futures performance to other asset classes including stocks and bonds portfolio diversification managed futures provide access to multiple markets enhanced portfolio efficiency managed futures when added to a traditional portfolio of equities and bonds have the potential to reduce volatility and enhance returns for the entire portfolio high performance potential potential to outperform traditional indices managed futures have the ability to go both long and short and thus have the potential to profit in rising or falling markets they have the potential over a longterm period to outperform traditional indices the graph below illustrates the performance of the cisdm cta equal weighted index vs the sp  total return index the msci world index and the barclays us aggregate bond index over the past  years the cumulative return on an initial investment would have been significantly higher for managed futures than for these other asset classes

superfund in january  he launched a company that developed and marketed financial software applications to institutions in austria from this platform he launched teletrader software ag which is currently a publicly held company offering financial software products to institutions and which has been listed on the austrian stock exchange since march in march  mr baha founded the first member of what is now the superfund group of companies launched one of the world s first retail managed futures funds and continued to develop the superfund trend following trading systems by  the proprietary software and trading systems were further refined resulting in a fully automated approach to trading during the past decade the superfund trading systems have been further developed tested and continually improved using  years of historical data the trading systems monitor and trade about  futures markets in eight core areas entry trading stoploss position exit oct nov dec jan feb eesuperfund trading chart as shown in the chart to the left the superfund trading systems limit losses by using stoploss orders the investment decisions are not dependent on fundamental data the trading systems constantly monitor all associated micro and macro risk factors and systematically determine buy and sell orders through technical analysis should there be a major trend reversal the program reacts immediately to adjust to the new environment in this manner the trading systems attempt to minimize losses and increase profit potential superfund strategy superfund usa llc and additional selling agents have offered an sec registered managed futures fund to private investors since november  superfund green lp  series a and series b the two series of the fund follow a similar investment strategy but vary according to level of risk and reward with series b having a risk and reward level that is approximately  times greater than that of series a market diversification superfund funds use proprietary trading systems that strive to produce minimal correlation to traditional investments futures contracts are traded in about  different financial and commodity markets around the world fundamental to the superfund trading style are low correlation between the different instruments and high liquidity for order execution technical trading systems positions are initiated using a proprietary technical algorithm that works to detect price trends in advance many systematic trend following systems employ technical indicators such as moving averages or bollinger bands to identify trading conditions the key to using such indicators successfully lies in the way they are interrelated and applied in combination trend following the superfund trading strategy is based on short medium and longterm trend following key to the past success of superfund funds is the ability to limit drawdowns by the daily maintenance of stop orders if a trend reverses loss is theoretically limited if a trend continues profits are theoretically protected in this way the superfund trading strategy seeks to optimize winning trades money management risk management plays a vital role in the superfund investment strategy consistent money management is the most important element of the superfund trading strategy trading risk is controlled by strictly limiting the size of individual trading positions and cutting losses early the total risk is continuously screened and drawdowns are limited by daily maintenance of stop orders in this way if a trend reverses losses are theoretically limited while if a trend continues profits are theoretically protected financial futures stock indices currencies bonds interest rates commodity futures metals energy grains agricultural markets eetraded markets the chart is only an indication of the variety of markets traded or that may be traded by superfund and is not indicative of relative allocations among these markets the actual allocations among these markets change over time due to liquidity volatility and risk considerations the profitability of series a or series b of superfund green lp could be materially diminished during periods when factors external to the market itself have an important impact on market prices during such periods superfund trading system could establish positions on the wrong side of the price movements caused by such external factors  correlation a relationship between two variables many investors are drawn to managed futures because of the low correlation to other major asset classes including managed futures as part of a diversified portfolio is seen as a risk management tool that can help investors not only when the stock market suffers losses but also when other portfolio components suffer losses the graphs below compare managed futures to the sp  during the  worst and  best months for stock performance from  through managed futures  vs  worst months of the

highly liquid financial instruments traded in about  financial and commodity markets around the globe by broadly diversifying across many global markets managed futures have the potential to simultaneously profit from price changes in stock bond currency and interest rates as well as from many commodity markets with historically low correlation to traditional asset classes a managed futures fund allows investors to participate in many different asset classes with one single investment portfolio diversification ease of global diversification managed futures are often used by investors as a way to diversify a portfolio from reliance on traditional stocks and bonds since managed futures typically trade in a wide variety of futures markets on many global exchanges they can

often used by investors to complement a portfolio of stocks and bonds and to help balance overall returns professor harry markowitz pioneered the concept of the modern portfolio theory over  years ago a cornerstone of professor markowitz s nobel prizewinning research was the efficient frontier of investments where he proved that adding a mix of diverse asset classes into an investment portfolio
