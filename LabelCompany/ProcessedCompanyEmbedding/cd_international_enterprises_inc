to shareholders from its chairman and chief executive officer dr james wang which reads as follows dear fellow shareholders with the completion and filing of our full year fiscal  audited financials we have taken the majority of steps necessary to regain compliance with our regulatory reporting requirements  we anticipate the filing of the remaining quarterly financial statements to be made in the coming weeks to finally complete that process and set the stage for a new chapter in our companys history for the past several years we have been working diligently to transition the company from an owner of manufacturing operations in china to a service based organization that sources and distributes industrial commodities internationally and provides management corporate consulting services  in this way we believe we are well positioned to leverage our managerial footprint in the us china and the americas while avoiding the need for significant capital expenditures   in order to complete that transition we exited all of our remaining manufacturing business in china beginning in  and ending with the discontinuing of our magnesium production operations in   as these operations had been consistently losing money since the global financial crisis in  management decided to exit all of these operations to focus on business services and other less capital intensive business opportunities with the completion of that transition we are currently structured into two business segments  our mineral trading segment sources and distributes industrial commodities to china and our consulting segment provides business consulting services to companies that operate or are seeking business opportunities primarily in china and the americas  in our consulting segment we provide a suite of consulting services to clients who conduct business in china or seek to conduct business within china we generate revenues by providing services in the areas of capital structure strategic partnerships mergers acquisitions translation services managing and coordinating the process of obtaining necessary government approvals and licenses in china as well as marketing and sales support we tailor our suite of services to meet the specific needs of each individual client a significant component of our competitive advantage lies in the quality of our personnel members of our team possess a strong working knowledge of the unique characteristics of business operations in the americas and china our function is to provide the necessary resources for chinese entities to invest in the americas and entities from the americas to invest in china our mineral trading segment is operated under our wholly owned us subsidiary cdii minerals inc which was incorporated in  cdii minerals is strategically positioned throughout several countries in south america and has developed the foundation and relationship network to expand rapidly  over the past several years we have successfully purchased iron ore tin ore and copper concentrate in ecuador bolivia and chile and exported to china currently we are working to expand our trading business in south america and are also evaluating other business opportunities with local companies to expand our south american presence in order to fulfill a niche market and add value through facilitating smooth international transactions we have strategically positioned our company as an intermediary between our suppliers in south america and our buyers in china  through a unique understanding of local business practices in each country cdii minerals arranges all required logistics and processing from the point of production through its final destination including the documentation and permits necessary to export and import the material as we move through the coming years we are excited to now have the company in a position to leverage our core competencies unburdened by the capital intensive legacy manufacturing operations in china  we have established a substantial business network in china and the americas and our team is now actively seeking to monetize that network on several fronts first our team has identified several acquisition candidates to accelerate revenue growth and build a solid base for the future  management is working diligently to complete at least one such acquisition prior to the end of calendar  second through working to bridge large chinese investments into certain projects in the americas we believe we have the opportunity to realize multiple potential homeruns to impact future revenue and earnings and third the network we have established in latin america has us poised to achieve substantial growth when mineral and industrial commodities markets rebound in the coming years  our diverse presence throughout latin america gives our partners and clients a unique advantage in commercial transactions we manage through our local expertise and business networks in each country in closing i would like to thank each and every shareholder for their support  we believe we have navigated through a tremendously challenging period for cd international over the past several years and we are now
