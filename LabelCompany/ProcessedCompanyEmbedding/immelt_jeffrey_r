earnings call with us today are our chairman and ceo jeff immelt our next chairman and ceo john flannery and ge vice chairman and cfo jeff bornstein before we start i would like to remind you that our earnings release presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our website at wwwgecominvestor please note that some of the statements we are making today are forwardlooking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today as described in our sec filings and on our website those elements can change as the world changes and now i’ll turn the call over to jeff immelt jeff immelt thanks matt ge had a solid quarter in a volatile world let me give you a few themes that describe the environment us is stable on a slow growth rate global growth is accelerating and resource markets remain challenging out topline results are solid in the second quarter our organic results were orders up  revenue up  margins expanded by  basis points and industrial profit grew by  at the half orders were up  revenues up  margins expanded by  basis points and industrial profit grew by  at the half we reduced structural cost by  million ahead of plan we generated  billion of cash in the quarter in line with our expectations in the quarter we made progress on our portfolio strategy july we closed ge baker hughes this move significantly strengthens our position in the sector this is a more competitive business and positioned for growth we closed lm a critical vertical integration move for wind business lm is already improving growth and margins we remain on track to close the sale of water in third quarter and industrial solutions by year end and we see good strategic and operational synergy with alstom overall we have no change to our  framework john will update you on his views for  and beyond later in the year our orders have been strong up  yeartodate and  in the quarter we saw strength in both equipment and service we grew backlog by  billion we continue to see pricing pressure in oil and gas we have slow industry with excess capacity let me give you a few order highlights that we consider most noteworthy aviation was up  really an amazing performance at the paris air show we announced  billion of commitments  times our nearest competitor oil and gas equipment orders grew by  this includes one of the few big project deals in the industry with eni in mozambique renewables were up  behind some big global deals we’re gaining share in europe we took orders for  h turbines in the second quarter with  in backlog global orders were up  and represented  of our total nine of  regions experienced growth with china up  india  and europe up  transportation signed an loi worth  million for locomotives in egypt digital orders were up close to  at the half meridium orders were up  and servicemax orders grew by  healthcare created a collaboration with partners for artificial intelligence solution and in service aviation spares grew by  military grew by  and power received a  billion service commitment for power plants in algeria there is no doubt that we’re outperforming competition in many markets and gaining share this is in time is building our install base for the future with this order rate and backlog we feel great about the  to  organic growth for the year organic revenue was up  and margins were up  basis points in the quarter yeartodate organic revenues up  and margins were up  basis points service revenues up  yeartodate so here are some key revenue highlights global revenue was up  with growth in nine of  regions europe grew by  china by  india by  and menat by  for the half we had organic service growth in all segments we’re gaining share with our products leap has an unprecedented advantage in the market we believe that ge has greater than  share in the gas turbine market and the market for h in wind we’re gaining share in europe for the first time healthcare closed a number of big enterprise deals for both healthcare solutions and life sciences our new cell therapy business grew by  and our mammo business where we’ve launched new products grew by  digital revenue growth was  and we see this accelerating through the year let me give you some perspectives on our margin performance as i said earlier our structural cost is  million yeartodate with strong performance in the business and corporate we expect to beat our  billion goal we had a  million of nonrepeat items that impacted our oil and gas and power businesses jeff will review these in the segment reviews we grew equipment in few areas that are dilutive in the cm rate in the shortterm but open up service growth in long term these include the h and leap products and the power balance plan this was expected and reflected in our margin goals for the year in the second half we’re targeting  basis points of improvement to generate  basis points for the year this kind of second half expansion is typical for ge we see sustained revenue growth and structural cost out helping us to achieve this goal in all we expect to hit the ebit target we’ve discussed in the past for cash cfoa was  billion in the quarter  billion from capital and a  billion from industrial cfoa in line with expectations here are some of the main drivers from industrial cfoa net income was actually below last year due to increased restructuring cost not covered by gains working capital performance was very good up a  billion from a year ago and a  million improvement in the quarter we saw improvement in receivables inventory and progress which was partially offset by lower payables contract assets were a drag but better than a year ago the second half cfoa profile will be a lot like last year we expect higher earnings we expect to reduce working capital by about  billion in the second half last year this was actually more it was  billion contract assets will grow at about the same level and we will benefit from timing of other our items we ended the quarter with  billion of cash on the balance sheet in line with expectations and we should be within the  billion to  billion goal for industrial cfoa now over to jeff jeff bornstein thanks jeff starting with consolidated results revenues were  billion down  in the quarter industrial revenues of  billion were also down  as you can see on the right side of the page the industrial segment was down  on a reported basis but up  organically driven principally by the appliances disposition industrial operating plus verticals eps was  down  versus the prior year driven by substantial appliance gain in the second quarter of last year we had  of restructuring with no gains in the quarter versus  of net gains after restructuring last year operating eps was  in the quarter down from  in the second quarter of  this incorporates the other continuing ge capital activity including excess debt and headquarter runoff costs that i’ll cover on the ge capital page continuing eps of  includes the impact of nonoperating pension and net eps of  includes discontinued operations the total disc ops impact was a charge of  million in the quarter driven by ge capital exit plan item ge tax rate was  in the quarter we still expect the ongoing operations of the business to have a mid teens tax rate for the year however the water disposition will be a lowtax transaction and will bring the overall tax rate for our industrial to around  for the third quarter and about that for the total year the ge capital tax rate was favorable reflecting a tax benefit on a pretax continuing loss we had a better cash quarter cfoa was  billion including  billion dividend from ge capital and industrial cfoa was  billion in the quarter it was up  billion from the first quarter and up substantially from the second quarter of last year at the half industrial cfoa is  million usage we expect substantial improvement in cash in second half driven by higher earnings continued working capital improvement on higher shipment partly offset by contract assets for the year we are guiding to the bottom end of the  billion to  billion range on cfoa driven by pressure principally in power and oil and gas john and i are reviewing our capital allocation plan for the year dividend remains our priority we are relooking the  billion to  billion range on cash use for buyback based on the timing of disposition yeartodate we bought back  billion of shares on the right side are the segment results as i mentioned the industrial segment revenues were down  on a reported basis and up  organically for the half the industrial segment revenues were up  organically industrial segment op profit was down  reported and down  organically and industrial op profit which includes corporate operating cost was down  reported and up  organically the demonstrated industrial op profit and industrial plus vertical eps yearoveryear is driven by the effects of restructuring the appliance gain and associated tax impacts of appliance through the half industrial op profit of  billion is up  reported and up  organically on an eps basis we’ve earned  of eps which is  excluding the first half naked restructuring given our outlook on oil and gas and power we are trending to the bottom end of the range of  to  eps for the year next on industrial and other items for the quarter as i said we had  of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate charges were little more than  million on a pretax basis this was slightly less than expected driven by lower cost to execute projects and shortterm timing delays on projects we will likely execute here in the third quarter corporate power renewables healthcare and oil and gas had the largest investments in the quarter restructuring charges totaled about  million and bd charges were approximately  million mostly related to baker hughes news the lm wind acquisition water diposition as well as the industrial solutions disposition and the digital transaction there were no gains in the quarter for the year we expect about  of restructuring to be offset by  of gains from the water and industrial solutions dispositions we’re targeting a third quarter close for the water transaction and the fourth quarter close for industrial solutions the industrial solutions transaction may push to early  but our plan is to do  of restructuring this year we’ll update you on deal timing as we get closer next i’ll cover the segments starting with power our recorded orders of  billion down  in the quarter excluding the large halcyon steam order in the second quarter of last year orders actually grew  equipment orders were down  but up  ex the halcyon order gas power system was up  on higher h turbine order of nine versus five last year and six ha units booked in mexico our first in the account the h backlog totaled  units hrsg orders grew a  to  versus  a year ago offsetting gps was steam power down  with no repeat of that halcyon order which totaled about  million equipment backlog grew  yearoveryear service orders were down  primarily driven by lower agps in the quarter of  versus  last year and the larger mix of light agps versus full scope and by lower outages which were down  this was partially offset by growth in installations and other upgrades service backlog grew  yearoveryear power revenues were up  to  billion equipment revenues were up  driven primarily by gas power systems up  on higher scope balance of plant and higher hrsg ship of  versus  last year this was partially offset by lower gas turbine shipment of  versus  service revenues grew  our distributor power services up  offset by flat power service power service is flat on lower outages and fewer and lighter scope agps  versus  offset by higher other upgrades which were up  operating profit in the quarter was down  on higher equipment versus services including higher balance of plant volume at low margin fewer agps and lower variable cost productivity which was partly offset by structural base cost down  lower vcp in the quarter was impacted by about  million of liquidated damages with delivery delays and fuel mod cost of about  million that we don’t expect to repeat going forward the business is finding opportunities for growth we took nine h turbine orders in the quarter we also booked the largest services deal in the history of the business the  billion algeria deal with sonelgaz that included  agps this showed up in backlog not orders in the quarter however we’re planning for a down market this year we expect the power market to see demand for about  gigawatts of power this year down about  consistent with what we said in march we’re also planning for a down market in  we expect to ship a  to  gas turbines in the year no change in that outlook we believe that we have a technology advantage relative to competitors and we’re gaining share having said that the market is very competitive and overcapacity and new product introductions will continue for services we expect  now to just to be down about  driven by fclass major outages which we think will be down about  as a result of lower utilization lower capacity payment particularly north america and extended intervals between outages this is softer than we expected coming into the year we are targeting total upgrades to grow and agps to total between  and  for the year however we have got a risk of  to  driven by timing of large second half agp deals that are yet to be agreed to the first half the business is up  on revenues and higher by  on operating profit with margin rates down  basis points power has taken out around  million of structural base costs to date and we are continuing to work additional actions on cost for the year next is renewables orders in the quarter were  billion up  reported and down  organic onshore wind orders of  billion were down  driven by lower repower orders and services onshore equipment orders were higher by  on strong international winds the number of units ordered was  versus  last year down  but the megawatts grew  on larger machines hydro orders of  million were up  and lm at  million of water orders in the quarter revenues were  billion up  up  organic onshore revenue grew  and hydro grew  onshore was driven by the repowering product that we introduced last year wind turbines shipped totaled  versus  last year down  but the megawatts shipped were  operating profit of  million was up  driven by repower volume better product cost and foreign exchange partly offset by price margin rates improved  basis points the wind market continues to be very competitive product cost out is absolutely imperative and the team has made progress on the  megawatt platform and need to execute the same on the same  megawatt turbine as we begin to deliver that machine lm will be critical to drive cost and differentiation going forward this business is on track with doubledigit growth and improved margin rates for the total year next on aviation the market continues to be robust global passenger rpks grew  yeartodate through may with strong growth on both domestic and international routes airfreight volumes have been very strong as well growing up over  may yeartodate and load factors globally are above  orders in the quarter totaled  billion up  equipment orders grew  and services grew  within equipment orders commercial engine orders grew  to  billion on higher leap ge and gex order these orders did not conclude any of the paris air show announcements we made military equipment orders of  million were down  driven by no repeat of an order last year for  t helicopter engine service orders grew  as i mentioned with commercial services higher by  on strong spears of  to  million a day and strong military services growth of  backlog finished the quarter up  to  billion revenues in the quarter were flat at  billion equipment revenue was down  driven by commercial down  and military down  commercial engine shipments were lower by  on pure legacy engines partly offset by higher leap volume the business shipped  leap engines in the quarter service revenues grew  on higher commercial spares up  and good military performance including our military spares operating profit of  billion was up  primarily driven by higher service volume and base cost productivity which more than offset the negative leap margin margins were  basis points higher in the quarter at the paris air show we announced  billion in orders and commitments including new engine commitments   billion and services up  billion none of these announcements were booked in orders of the second quarter in additive we announced the development of the world’s largest laser powder machine targeted to the aerospace segment we also announced a partnership with stryker r to provide machines material and services for the global supply chain operation the leap engine continues to perform to spec with  aircraft flying today the business is on track to ship  to  leap engines this year the business is executed well in the first half as leap shipments accelerate in the second half we expect the margins to be pressured and still expect total year margin rate to be roughly flat with  next on oil and gas we closed the combination of our legacy oil and gas business with legacy baker hughes in july rd the new company’s listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol bhge in september lorenzo and his team will give you an update on the outlook of the new company and the progress on integration and synergy today we will discuss only the results of ge’s legacy oil and gas business and not the results of legacy baker hughes business the oil and gas environment remains challenging our legacy business sees some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitment oil prices remain volatile and as a result our customers remain cautious as we’ve said previously we expect shorter cycle activity to increase in the second half of the year so far these improvements are tending below our expectations orders in the quarter of  billion grew  versus last year and grew  organically the equipment booktobill ratio was to for the first time in the better part of two years equipment orders totaled  billion up  every business segment grew subsea was higher by a  on orders in brazil and the eni mozambique coral project turbomachinery was up  also driven by the eni coral scope and service orders grew  on strength of the middle east we had terminations in the quarter totaling  million driven predominantly by one project scheduled to deliver beyond  service orders were  billion down  on softer markets driven by turbomachinery down  surface down  subsea down  partially offset by strong performance by digital solutions which grew  total backlog ended the quarter at  billion down  versus last year revenues of  billion were down  versus last year equipment revenue was down  driven by subsea down  which more than offset growth in surface up  and turbomachinery up  service revenues were flat yearoveryear operating profit of a  million in the quarter was down  performance was driven by unfavorable price and negative variable cost productivity that more than offset sourcing and structural cost out on variable cost productivity i put the impacts in two categories first we had two big onetime items rework on a nonrecurring issue related to a single contract totaling about  million and a writedown obsolete inventory for about  million second lower volume impacted both overhead absorption and supply chain benefit we also had  million of integration costs in the business in the quarter as the market recovery’s been slower and more volatile than we planned performance of the business in the second quarter was below expectation customers are delaying purchasing for both larger projects and shorter cycle opex activity given the slower market activity we expect that numbers in the second for legacy ge oil  gas to be lower than previously anticipated but improve from the first half the business is veryfocused on the synergy pipeline with the integration in order to offset as much of the market pressures possible beginning with third quarter results bhge will release its own financial statements and hold a separate earnings call we will consolidate baker hughes ge into our financial statements less than  minority interest next on healthcare orders of  billion grew   organically on an organic basis the us was up  europe was up  and the emerging markets grew  driven china up  asean up  latin america grew  the middle east actually declined  organically in the quarter on a product basis healthcare systems orders grew   organically driven by ultrasound up  and imaging products higher by  mammography and ct were particularly strong on the new product launches life care solutions was flat driven by the impact of healthcare reform uncertainty in the us market our life sciences business grew orders  organically with core imaging up  and bioprocess up  revenues in the quarter of  billion grew  organically healthcare systems grew revenues  organically and life sciences grew by  organically operating profit was up  in the quarter to  million driven by volume and productivity partially offset by price and programs for product cost reduction margins improved  basis points in quarter we expect the second half performance to be similar to the first half with low to mid single digit revenue growth with stronger operating profit growth the business is executing well and we will continue to simplify structure to drive lower product cost on transportation north american carload volume continues to improve off a low base carload volume grew  in the quarter driven by intermodal higher by  and commodity carloads up  commodity carload growth was driven by export coal up  and agriculture up  partially offset by petroleum down  despite improving trends since mid overcapacity remains in parked locos around  and very little investment appetite from us customers orders in the quarter of  million were higher by  on easy comparison equipment orders of  million doubles on international demand for  locos service orders of  million grew  a good growth in loco parts and mining revenues of  billion were down  with equipment down  and services flat we shipped  locals in the quarter versus  a year ago with international shipments up  partly offsetting north america which was down  operating profit in the quarter was down  on lower volume partly offset by cost actions the north american locomotive market will continue to be challenging in  and  we expect  loco shipments to be lower by about  with operating profit down double digits since we’ve guided the business is focused on growing internationally the business recently announced a  million win in egypt for a  locos plus service we expect this to book as an order in the third quarter executing on resizing the business to market has been ongoing and we continue to evaluate additional actions as needed next on energy connections and lighting orders for the segment totaled  billion with energy connection orders of  billion and current orders of  million the energy connections orders were down  reported and down  organic driven by grid down  on no repeatable large egypt order and power conversion down  offset by  growth in the industrial solutions revenues ex appliances were reported down  but up  organic energy connection revenues were higher by  organic on strength in grid and industrial solutions partly offset by power conversion lightning revenues were down  with current down  and legacy down  as a result of the market exits and restructuring we’ve been doing over the past year operating profit in the quarter was  million up over  ex appliance energy connection nearly doubled profits to  million on grid and industrial solutions performance and productivity partly offset by power conversion on weak volume lighting earned  million versus a loss last year as announced energy connections will be consolidated with power in the third quarter which we believe will create significant opportunity for future structural cost out we’ll provide recast date once we finalize it in the third quarter finally i’ll cover ge capital the verticals earned  million in the quarter up  from the prior year driven primarily by higher base earnings gecas energy finance and industrial finance all had strong quarters and they delivered a solid first half of the year they execute ahead of the plan on their  guidance in the second quarter the verticals funded  billion of onbook volume and enabled approximately  billion of industrial orders overall portfolio quality remains stable other continuing operations generated  million loss in the quarter driven by  million of excess interest expense a  million of preferred dividend  million of restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and  million of headquarters runoff expense other continuing was  million better than last year driven by lower excess interest and lower headquarter cost discontinued operations generated a  million loss from trailing costs and exit plan related items overall ge capital reported a net loss of  million  better than last year ge capital paid  billion in cash dividends during the quarter bringing the yeartodate total to  billion and ended the quarter with a  billion of assets including  billion in liquidity down  billion from the first quarter looking ahead during the second half of the year we expect lower asset sale and as a reminder we will conduct our annual impairment review with gecas in the third quarter in the fourth quarter we will perform our annual cash flow test of our runoff insurance business we recently have had adverse claims experience in a portion of our longterm care portfolio and we will assess the adequacy of our premium returns we will update you in the fourth quarter lastly in other continuing operations for the second half of the year we continue to expect incremental tax benefit associated with recovering a portion of the exit plan tax cost we incurred with that i’ll turn it over to john john flannery thanks jeff i just wanted to give you a quick update on our transition process as you know my official start date is august st and we’d indicated earlier that i’d be doing a full review of the company and be back to investors in the fall with my views we are on track with this process i am in the middle of a series of deep dives into each of the businesses looking at everything you would expect what is the market outlook where can we grow where can we improve margins how is the cash conversion what returns are we getting on investment for example next week we will be visiting our power and aviation businesses we are also taking a hard look at our corporate spending going through a zero base budget exercise on all of our functions and making sure  of our ge store outlays are accretive to the overall results of the company in addition to the business reviews i want to repeat the process i used in healthcare to really get out and listen to what people are thinking good and bad about the company i always start with customers and employees but it’s also important to get the view of our government partners and especially our investors as i was out with matt cribbins last week and we saw about  different analysts and portfolio managers and we will be doing more of that over the next couple of months there is a lot of positive feedback from these listening sessions but also plenty of suggestions on ways we can improve this is all leading to a report out in november our main focus then will be translating the business assessments into our thoughts on cost out and capital allocation choices as well as reframing our look at  and beyond i’m really excited to get started officially on august st and look forward to our ongoing dialogue so jeff back to you to wrap jeff immelt thanks john overall we have no change to the framework but there are puts and takes in each area we see the key elements of earnings to be on track  to  organic growth and  basis points of margin enhancement we have pressure in power and oil and gas but we’ll outperform structural cost out we’ve set a target of  billion for industrial ebit and we expect to hit it even with those headwinds jeff discussed the impact of additional pressure from the resource sector could have on the eps range earlier we expect to hit  billion to  billion of free cash flow plus dispositions we still expect to have solid industrial cfoa between the  billion to  billion again somewhat dependent on the resource sector our dispositions are taking longer than expected but we have to close both in the year i expect john to take a fresh look at capital allocation but ge will always have a strong commitment to the dividend let’s take a bigger picture view of the company we have created a very strong position in power healthcare transport and resources big industrial segments we don’t like the current on a gas cycle but our business is significantly improved and will prosper as the cycle recovers we are gaining share in most of our markets with  billion of backlog we have a leadership position in the industrial internet and additive manufacturing two growth areas and drivers of industrial productivity and in volatile global economy our industrial ebit plus the earnings from our ge capital verticals should be about  billion and again generate between  billion and  billion in the free cash flow plus disposition so a pretty good performance in the volatile environment i know john flannery can improve on this john is off to a great start and i look forward to working with him matt now over to you for some questions matt cribbins thank you with that let’s open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from julian mitchell from credit suisse julian mitchell my question would really be on the cfoa for the year coming in at the lower end of the  billion to  billion guidance sounds like that’s mostly power and oil and gas so i wondered if you could give us some transparency around what is the cash conversion or free cash flow margin like in those two businesses in  and when you think about their cash flow performance this year how much do you think it’s weighed down by shortterm onetime factors in other words how quickly do you think it can spring back to an acceptable level of cash flow in those two businesses jeff bornstein yes julian so we expect the power business to deliver a positive cfoa in the year for sure as well as oil and gas and we actually oil and gas to have  relative to the environment they are operating in and how do we see their second half a reasonably good performance around cfoa for the year for oil and gas so the power business is going to be something like  to  conversion in the year other businesses will be higher healthcare will be closer to  aviation will be quite good but i would guess that power is going to be somewhere between  to  conversion for the year jeff immelt i would also add julian we’re doing  billion of cash related to restructuring a lot of that’s in the power sector none of us expect that to repeat in  so that’s a natural tailwind let’s say in terms of cfoa in  jeff bornstein so why don’t i walk from the first half to the second half a little bit in terms of kind how we’re thinking about it there is no doubt we have a big second half to deliver on cash and that’s similar to where we were last year relative to the first half there is really three big drivers one we’ve got higher earnings in line with our volume our costout profile and gains versus restructuring in the first half we had a  headwind in the second half with the gains we’ll offset that  headwind and have   offset in earnings we’ll have significantly better working capital performance although i think we feel pretty good about the second quarter we generated  million in cfoa in the second quarter from working capital and that was almost  billion better than where we were in the second quarter of last quarter i think importantly within that there was a couple hundred million of inventory improvement which i don’t think we’ve ever realized in the second quarter of any year in recent history as we look to the second half the working capital will get better largely driven by inventory a bit by payables and we’ll have some receivables improvement and that’s consistent where we were last year so working capital last year we improved in the second half better than  billion we’re not anticipating  billion but looking more at just under  billion improvement this year so we think we’ve executed before we can execute again in a similar way and lastly on contract assets we still expect contract assets to be a cash usage in the second half but not nearly the rate that we saw in the first half and we expect it will look very similar to the change in contract assets in the second half of last year which was about  billion or  billion so if you look at second half cash flow versus  we delivered  billion of cfoa in the second half of last year we need to do about  billion more this year which is primarily a function of earnings and we expect working capital to be about  billion better in the second half so the total improvement for the year of about  billion and that’s less than the  billion of working capital improvement we had in the second half of last year as i say contract asset has been a little bit of drag in the second half but in line with where we were in the second half of last year and i’d say lastly other operating all the other elements of cash flow will be better in the second half than the first half and will be better substantially versus  so that’s kind of how we think about going from the first half to the second half jeff immelt and also say jeff in  we ran the place with a couple of  billion less working capital we’re into the same thing in  but i think the team  there is a lot of juice in this left and i think we have every expectation that we’re going to be able to continue to reduce the amount of working capital that’s needed to run ge in the near future operator thank you our next question comes from andrew kaplowitz from citi andrew kaplowitz so could you give us a little more color on what you are seeing in power you mentioned trending toward the bottom of your eps range for the company i think despite a lower tax rate and power specifically is services overall just a tougher market than you thought you talked about the delays you are seeing in services but how much of the power weakness would you say is execution related and how much lowhanging fruit does russell have to improve delivery timing and overall execution of the business jeff bornstein so i guess i’ll start others can way in i would say generally i think the units market on the equipment side is more or less what we thought it would be we said  we saw  gigawatt market down  in that context we said we thought we’d take orders for  to  units in the year we still think that holds we’ve got about  units during the first half we said we thought we’d ship  to  we think that’s still a reasonable expectation and we talked about the gas turbine business the units business turning around profitability from the launch last year to this year and we still expect that holds true i think on the service front i think it definitely is softer than we thought when you look at outage volumes we thought outages were going to be down mid singledigits right now it looks like particularly in the gas base and on the bigger fclass outages we’re running about  down yearoveryear that’s partly driven by utilization it’s partly lower capacity payments it’s partly extending intervals between outages but that feels softer so the transactional business which is  plus percent of the business that feels softer than where we came into the year but i’ll put it little bit in perspective i think having said that to the first half revenues in the business were up  operating profit was  there is definitely some execution there i talked about  plus million of lds and a fuel mod that we had to do we don’t expect those to continue the  million of lds were really around prelaunch h unit where we took a little bit of risk on schedule and commission and not having been through the process and it took us a bit longer to get there we feel like we’re absolutely on track on the balance of the h commitment so we don’t expect the lds to continue and then when you think about total year we still think about the power business being up mid single digits on revenue and up roughly high to low double digits on earnings i just think that in the backlog of everything we have got in front of us here that it does feel softer the business still thinks they are going to do  to  agps in the year but i think the mix of light agps versus full scope agps is a higher  the mix of light is heavier than we probably anticipated coming into the year and then i talked about in that estimate on agps we have some risk we have got some really big deals in the second half that could put  or  of those units of risk i’m not telling you the business doesn’t think they are going to deliver them i’m just highlighting for you there could be a risk there so definitely service is softer than maybe we came into the year with i think the units business is more or less as expected and it’s gas outrages on the service side lower steam and boiler work on the outage side in services but overall if we can get to a year that’s kind of up mid single digits on revenue and high single digits to low double digits on op profit everything else being equal not too bad jeff immelt and i would add to that andrew as you put the energy connections business together with the power business you’re going to look at a funnel of maybe another  billion of structural costs you can take out of the combined business rolling into  so i think to add to jeff there is probably close  million that shouldn’t repeat that we should have done better in the quarter i think the profile for the year is still going to look attractive for the segment and i think the team has a nice cost  is developing a good cost plan going into  that i think should create a buffer against the market jeff bornstein there is both an opportunity and necessity to restructure the cost structure of this business given the market that we are operating in and i expected that the business on their structural cost commitments is going to over perform in  and as jeff just talked about we are building a plan around something close to a  of structural cost out of  operator next we have jeffrey sprague from vertical research partners jeffrey sprague jeff immelt good luck and thanks for all your thoughts and insights over the year much appreciated jeff immelt jeff you and i have done this a long time i’m going to miss you and i look forward to having a beer with you as a citizen someday as civilian jeffrey sprague i’d like to do that definitely just on cash flow i guess maybe perhaps for jeff bornstein the first half obviously came in short of what you thought you thought you would kind of equal last year at roughly  million i wonder if you could also decompose what the source of that may be roughly  million shortfall was and just your comment on share repo are you linking the conclusion or execution of these divestitures to your share repurchase plan or what variable is really driving the reevaluation of the repo thank you jeff bornstein so i think what i said on the call maybe i misspoke on the call what i meant to say on the call was we expected the cfoa in the second quarter would be substantially better sequentially from the first and substantially better than the second quarter of last year i didn’t mean to say that we would be flat yearoveryear i think generally speaking at  billion  billion of cfoa we felt pretty good about that would we have liked it been a bit higher sure but i thought the inventory performance was pretty good the receivables performance was pretty good payables were used in the quarter maybe a little higher than we expected but that’s partly driven by the costout that’s happening and the inventory improvement so i think at a  billion that was reasonable performance and it puts us pretty close to where we were at the half you were right we’re down  year to date yearoveryear but that was included in the context of how i kind walked you from how we think about going from the first half to the second half total year and with that means for working capital and other cash flow improvement we expect to see on repurchase i think our share buyback has always been predicated on dividends from ge capital and the disposition so no change in there i think that there is a risk that industrial solutions won’t happen in the year it’s hard for me to exactly handicap but i think there is at least an equal probability that will happen in the first quarter of  it will happen in the fourth quarter of this year as i mentioned earlier we feel pretty good about the fact that water will get to a closing here in the third quarter so having said all of that i think as part of john’s relook about what we’re doing i think john wants to go back and rethink about how we think about capital allocation in the company and embedded in that obviously is how we think about share buyback so we’re being open objective and john wants to take a look at it and really work through with the team what the right way forward is and what the right alternatives are jeff immelt i hate to be a broken record but there is  jeff there is  billion of cash associated with restructuring in  that’s probably a  million or  million more than  and that should mainly not repeat going into  so that’s in these numbers and i would just eco what jeffery said about capital allocation what john should do the only other context i’d give you though is that everybody here prioritizes the dividend in a very high  at very high level and i just don’t want anybody to ever be confused about that in the context ge what we do how we do and whoever ceo is how we think about that as a context i was here the day we cut the dividend it was the worst day of my tenure as ceo and the dividend is really i think incredibly important for our investors and for the team jeff bornstein just one point of clarification on the restructuring cash so yes we’ll probably spend slightly more than  billion in cash on restructuring in  everything else being equal i’m trying to avoid giving the  guidance here before john’s gone through framework but we would expect to spend substantially less than that in  but it won’t be zero there will be projects we do in the third and fourth quarter that allow cash that spills over operator thank you next we have deane dray from rbc capital markets deane dray for jeff congrats and best wishes on your last earnings call and we are expecting to hear good reports about improvements in your golf game a question for john so given the management transition and now the midnovember timing for the reset and the new vision for the company how can you minimize the effects of ge being in somewhat of a state of limbo until then for want of a better word john flannery listen we are going through a process that we’ve laid out for you guys it’s a substantial process in a large company that takes a commensurate amount of time i’d say jeff and jeff have laid out a framework for the year already so there should be no change in thinking around that and then we’re spending a lot of time internally with the team so i would say there is no risk of limbo inside the team i actually start august st but there’s a lot of interaction already so i’m not worried about internal paralysis if you will and you have our outlook for the year so i look forward to the november  a robust discussion in november about the company and not worried that we’re going to be dead in the water in the meantime jeff immelt and i think the teams are still executing against their aip plans their ltip plans there is a ton of operational focus inside the company that investors can count on while john’s going through his kind of an over to the top review jeff bornstein i would just  if you don’t mind john i would just add it’s an enormous company it’s complex we want to reground rebaseline everything we do in this company how we do it the value of the ge store how it creates value in our franchise that’s a big big body work as well as understanding portfolio and john getting deep on and developing his own views about what we’re going to invest against what we’re going to not invest against et cetera so i understand the point completely deane i just think that’s a meaningful body of work and i think when john gets up in front of investors and shares his views we want that to be as absolutely as well informed as possible so i just think it takes that amount of time but i understand your point between now and then there’ll be a lot of people speculating on how john might come out of it operator thank you next we have andrew obin from bank of america merrill lynch andrew obin yes good morning jeff thanks for all the work over the years look forward to work with your successor thank you very much just a question on power the outlook for  just sort of talking about lower and thinking about siemens’ commentary is it cyclical or is something structural going on in terms of outlook for power jeff immelt i think andrew if you look at a micro study like iea which or epe ph study of the industry things like that these would show slow but steady increases in the evolution around natural gas really for the next  years right in terms of additions to capacity and things like that and you can triangulate that against whatever your assumptions might be on accelerating penetration of solar reduction of nuclear there is a whole series of things over the next five years or  years or  years but i think what’s clear is with the ongoing outlook for the cost of natural gas gas turbans and gas power generation are going to be one of the staples of the future of the industry now does that mean  gigawatts instead of  gigawatts in the shortterm i don’t think any of are that smart you’ve got places like saudi arabia that used to be the biggest gas turbine market that have been slower over the last couple of years they’re going to need capacity there is  what does china do visàvis their environmental issue there is probably five markets that matter that would make it more on the upside but i actually think there is a fit for the gas market going forward that being said i don’t think there is benefit to jeff or john or to russell now to be overly bullish about the nearterm kind of dynamics around the industry but at the same time i think somewhere in the ish area is pretty much where i would think about the industry going forward and then outrages that jeff went through this is going to be a function of kind of renewable mix it’s going to be a function of hot summer cold winters price of coal price of gas and bunch of other things but i think there is reasons to believe that that number stabilizes as time goes on jeff bornstein andrew i think that when we get up in november we will share our view of where we think the power business is going for  and to some degree beyond that we think the power market this year for gas turbine can be  gigawatts that’s down roughly  it might be down again next year i think so far the business is competitively been in a good place we’ve seen a little bit of price but we are definitely outperforming competition on both price orders and share when john is deep in the business and develop the view with russell on where this is going we will share that in november jeff immelt i think you are sitting though jeff in a year where equipment means ph is going to be  the power equipment is going to be  or something it’s going to be high let’s put it that way that doesn’t spell disaster i don’t think operator thank you and our final question comes from chris glynn from oppenheimer chris glynn i just had a question on the contract accounting longterm service agreements wondering if there is an update on the accounting change impact next year and also if there is any view to somehow monetizing the ltsas in a way that’s different from the past jeff bornstein so a couple of things one is i don’t have an update for you today on the  accounting change we are working it rigorously when we have an update as to the impact to   and a relook at what we think the impact might be in  we will share that with you right now we are going through first quarter actuals and auditing those and making sure we’ve got the processes in place to deal with all the changes so i don’t have any change in guidance for you on that i don’t have an update other than we are going through the mechanics in the process it’s pretty complicated stuff particularly around ltsas on monetization listen i’m  particularly where there has an interest in putting upgrades or other investment into a contract if there are capital markets solutions to help customers do that and were pricing for that as opposed to us essentially pricing it i’m wide open on that those structures are not simple but we continue to explore what those might be we have done a little bit of it we have done some of it for sure but mostly focused around how we think about upgrade and the variable component where it’s utilization based it’s very difficult to think about doing something around that but if you’ve got fixed payments embedded like for an upgrade that is something that we can think about doing the last thing i’d tell you just  in the quarter nobody asked but our cmrs or ltsa gains in the quarter were  million they were  million in the second quarter of last year so they are down  million yearoveryear matt cribbins okay thank you and just a reminder that the replay of today’s call will be available this afternoon on our investor website and jeff to wrap up your last call jeff immelt great matt so the first time i did this all we did was fax a press release and that’s been replaced  subsequent times by this incredible work so it shows you i’ve been doing this a long time or how much times have changed i would like to publically thank the ge

the final installment of our twopart interview general electric chairman and ceo jeff immelt explains what’s driving the company’s evolution how he leads and why he’s different from jack welch video jeff immelt formally took the helm of general electric in september  there’s no question the world has changed dramatically in the  years since but what about the company in this interview with mckinsey’s rik kirkland immelt explains how the industrial giant has evolved selling major lines of business investing in data and analytics and becoming in immelt’s words only as broad as it is deep at the same time he reveals how he has changed as a leader and why he believes the commandandcontrol style of his predecessor jack welch wouldn’t work today an edited transcript of immelt’s comments follows interview transcript we were  percent inside the united states when i became ceo today we’re just massively more global and we have to be strong in these industries we have to be able to get  or  percent market share in china in our healthcare business i would contend it’s hard to be focused on getting  percent market share in your healthcare business and still worry about a media enterprise in the united states at the same time those two tasks were maybe this far apart in the s holds fingers apart and are this far apart in the s holds arms far apart this notion of being only as broad as you are deep is the way you have to think about how you run a company today read more about leadership interview thomson reuters on making information useful interview heidrick  struggles on the changing nature of leadership interview dangote group on the africa opportunity evolving a corporate giant if you look at some of the things we’ve done over the past let’s say five or ten years what we try to do is reflect on both where we think markets are going and also on what we think our core competency is and my assessment of the world is that we’re really in this period of slow growth and volatility there’s just not a lot of tailwind you have to make your own tailwind and as a result depth matters in other words if you look back on the ’s it wasn’t that anybody did anything wrong but you had so much tailwind you could be broader than you were deep what we’ve tried to do is narrow our focus as a company to be only those things that have significant core competency so that’s led us into being a global infrastructure leader we think we’re playing to the company’s strengths and at the same time we’re playing to those things that the world needs—that have some robustness and some buoyancy that’s led us to be more global it’s led us to be more technical it’s led us to exit media shrink financial services and be in those things that can play in what we call the ge store technology globalization and those things that we think are core to the company we’re a narrower company—we’re still huge—but we’re a narrower company and we’re a deeper company and we’re playing into this global infrastructure need which maybe doesn’t have a robust tailwind every day but over the long term i think we’re playing into those things that the world needs the ge store globalization is uniquely a bigcompany game in other words when i go to china when a new ge team goes to china they have  people who are ge employees in china we have  in europe so you never travel alone it’s a “one company” strategy and so we’re very clear we call all of that the ge store the store of capability now i think nbc is a good business was a great business high margin the people who ran it are great but they never shopped at the store they never wanted to be in the store they never brought much to the store basically we have the portfolio that fits the store and that’s how we think about the horizontal capability for the company leadership with less control you never go through a process of leading anything particularly in the time period we’ve been in without learning a lot and changing a little bit and what i’ve now seen in terms of the job itself i would say the ceo of a company like ge has to be all about change it has to be all about picking what’s next getting the company focused making the company accountable i think that was true then and it’s true today i would say that’s critical the most important thing that happens with tenure is you just become more humble i’m a better risk manager a better learner a better questioner there’s just no way you can ever enter the job with enough humility you never lose your sense of optimism you’re just more reflective on everything that happens the world’s just so doggone different today than it was   or  years ago i would say no matter what you’re running you control fewer things and so you need to be more resilient jack was a great ceo but he really controlled his world it was a centralized kind of commandandcontrol company those days are over i’m in the riskmanagement business governments are more active the world is more difficult you’re not in the control business today you’re in the riskreward business article actions share this article on linkedin share this article on twitter share this article on

follow jenamcgregor follow addedvalueth general electric chairman and chief executive jeffrey immelt will step down from the top job this summer pat sullivanap general electric said monday that its longtime chief executive jeffrey r immelt would retire at the end of this year closing out a year run at the helm of the industrial giant which included a vast overhaul of the conglomerates portfolio but also an underperforming stock price that has trailed well below market indexes and competitors general electric is the only remaining member of the original dow jones industrial average created in  by charles dow and running ge remains one of the most highwattage jobs in corporate america in the past its very makeup — electric lightbulbs appliances nbc — gave ge a touch point to hundreds of millions of americans and consumers worldwide because of its size and ability to generate cash the us economy and the millions of pensioners savers and investors have depended on the success of the general electric stock price and dividend — whether they knew it or not on immelts watch ge has been the dows worst performing stock among companies that havent gone bankrupt or left the group of bluechip stocks immelt’s inability to move that stock price — it fell by more than a quarter during his tenure — was thought by many to be his undoing why the change two words stock price said ivan feinseth chief investment officer at tigress financial partners “there is no question the board and shareholders have given jeff immelt a long time he was ceo for almost  years in one of the biggest upmarkets cycles in history and the stock has underperformed immelt  will be succeeded on aug  by john flannery the current president and chief executive of the companys healthcare business and will remain chairman until the end of the year the company said that the announcements were part of a succession plan that had been in place since  and that now was an “ideal time for change” as the company has completed its “pivot” away from financial services and the move of its headquarters from fairfield conn to boston in an interview immelt put it this way the average tenure of a ceo is eight years this is twice that thats plenty the company appears to be trying to turn a new page with wall street jack brennan former ceo of vanguard who is the lead independent director on ges board said in an interview that whats been led by jeff is what john will build upon john brings a set of financial skills and a mindset around returns and returns on investment that is very strong he said the companys announcement comes amid recent pressure from the activist investor nelson peltzs trian fund management which had pushed ge to cut costs and change up the executive compensation bonus plan trian fund had no comment on the leadership change before mondays news the companys shares have fallen  percent since jan  while the standard  poors stock index had climbed  percent during immelts tenure ges total return with dividends included was about  percent while the sp  during the same period returned nearly  percent with dividends included immelt has been closely watched from even before he took over he and two other ge executives robert nardelli and jim mcnerney were forced to undergo a very public “bake off” to succeed the largerthanlife jack welch immelt ultimately earned the job making him only the th chairman in ges yearhistory nardelli left to run home depot then chrysler mcnerney had successful subsequent careers with m and until recently boeing the company is widely considered a farm system for future executives of major us corporations welch was known for his singular mission increasing the stock price he and a cadre of similar executives during the s and s were known for their devotion to maximizing shareholder value many us corporate executives in the decades following world war ii strayed from that religion with the result helping to spur the advent of takeovers buyouts and other financial devices designed to increase corporate bottom lines general electric stock jumped  percent on the news of immelt’s departure monday morning signalling wall street’s positive reception to the change “his managerial decisions resulted in investing in projects that did not maximize shareholder value” said david kass a professor of finance at the university of maryland “did he choose the right portfolio of projects to maximize shareholder value i question whether he did” others see immelt’s tenure in a favorable light “jeff immelt is unfairly criticized for not doing enough for ge shareholders” said michael farr an investor and president of farr miller  washington a washington dc firm “in fact he provided an excellent transition from the jack welch magical donowrong leadership and a highly leveraged balance sheet to a more conservative firm able to weather and endure many observers believe immelt was dealt a difficult hand the timing of his arrival to the job could not have been worse he took over as ceo just days before the  terrorist attacks the surprise attacks brought american business and airline travel to a halt with farreaching impact on ge’s jet engine business moreover says william blair analyst nicholas heymann immelt had to rebuild  billion in loss reserves in the company’s reinsurance business an early hole that forced him to curtail capital spending and reinvestment in growth early in his tenure then there was the  financial crisis in which ge capital  one of the company’s biggest moneymakers by that time accounting for roughly half its net income  turned into a liability heymann said real estate investments prompted immelt to get caught at the wrong place at the wrong time exacerbating the tough conditions hed inherited he worked through a lot of challenges he said he never had a chance to have the wind at his back when the road was flat in many ways financial services has been the biggest negative dynamic on the company immelt said at one point ge went hat in hand to investor warren buffett who lent the company  billion in the depths of the crisis on terms that were very beneficial to berkshire hathaway general electric paid the money back in  including a  million bonus plus accrued and unpaid dividends ges competitors faced the same sort of head winds and honeywell run by a former ge executive david cote has thrived immelt has made dramatic changes to ges business not only through completing  billion in asset sales for ge capital over the past two years but in taking on big acquisitions and divesting out of businesses such as ge appliances nbc universal and ge plastics immelt said the companys industrial businesses  as diverse as locomotives complex highly technical health care devices oil fields services and turbine manufacturing  have done phenomenally well over the last  years he leaves a solid company with an honorable ethical reputation farr said he worked hard and did well he gets very high marks from me” flannery  has been at ge since  and led the acquisition of alstom the largest industrial acquisition in the company’s history during his tenure leading ge healthcare the company said he has increased organic revenue by  percent its fair to say none of us are happy with the price right now and want to move that up flannery said ultimately his success will be viewed on his ability to appease shareholders and put the stock price back on an upward arc something immelt was simply unable to do “you can’t say it was greedy obnoxious impatient shareholders feinseth said they gave him  years” read also jack welch bashes trump for crappy management practices like on leadership follow us on facebook and twitter and subscribe to our

on physical products from the manufacturing divisions credit fred r conradthe new york times to train its future leaders general electric has rising young stars study and visit an array of different organizations from google to west pointwhat can managers at the yearold industrial giant learn from google a corporate mindset that prizes “constant entrepreneurship” says jeffrey r immelt ge’s chairman and chief executive during an interview at his corporate headquarters in fairfield connand what wisdom is on tap at the united states military academy “adaptability” and “resiliency” amid uncertainty says mr immelt — skills as vital to surviving in business as they are on the battlefieldstrategies are useful he says but only if they can quickly adjust to nasty realworld surprises “in the words of the great philosopher mike tyson” mr immelt says smiling “everybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth” advertisement continue reading the main story perhaps no company outside of the banking sector was hit as hard by the financial crisis as ge certainly none that seemed healthy before the economic tailspin its big finance arm ge capital long a cash machine that bolstered the mother ship’s bottom line became an albatross threatening to pull down the entire enterprise ge cut its dividend for the first time since the great depression lost its triplea credit rating and hastily arranged a  billion investment from the billionaire warren e buffett continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story having skirted disaster ge is recovering gradually these days its finance unit is on the mend with the size of its debts and troubled loans trending downward mind you middling recoveries are a relative matter at ge after all the company remains a colossus on track to deliver profits of more than  billion on sales of about  billion this year but investors are used to getting more from ge which earned  billion on revenue of  billion in so ge has revamped its strategy in the wake of the financial crisis its heritage of industrial innovation reaches back to thomas edison and the incandescent light bulb and with that legacy in mind ge is going back to basics the company mr immelt insists must rely more on making physical products and less on financial engineering — a path that he insists is also necessary for the american economy as a wholemr immelt candidly admits that ge was seduced by ge capital’s financial promise — the lure of rapidfire moneymaking unencumbered by the longrange planning costs and headaches that go into producing heavyduty material goods other industrial corporations were enthralled with finance of course but none as much as ge which became the nation’s largest nonbank financial companythe big buildup of ge capital occurred during the tenure of mr immelt’s famous predecessor jack welch but while mr immelt who took over in  spun off the unit’s insurance business he also bulked up on commercial real estate and other loans in  ge even bought a subprime lender in california wmc mortgage which it shed in  for a  billion lossin the buoyant years before the credit crisis the company’s finance arm contributed nearly half of ge’s overall profits when mr immelt had qualms about the unit’s risks he sought outside opinions including ordering up a study by the consulting firm mckinsey  company in sixty days later the consulting team he says told ge that money from nations with a trade surplus like china and sovereign wealth funds among other investors would provide enough liquidity in the financial system to fuel lending and leverage for the foreseeable future mckinsey declined to comment on the studymr immelt and his advisers had plenty of company in missing the gathering storm“but clearly” mr immelt concedes “ge capital was too big in the context of ge” going back to the early s he explains anticipated returns — not so much market expertise — guided investment decisions if a deal looked like a money spinner he says it got the nod “and you don’t have to build a factory” he adds advertisement continue reading the main story today the financial unit is becoming smaller and focusing on fields where ge believes it has a competitive advantage those specialty areas include industries in which ge has a strong manufacturing presence like power generation aviation and healthcare equipment and lending to midsize industrial companies unless a deal is in a business where ge has distinctive skills mr immelt says he won’t let ge capital dive in“we’re not going to do it whether there are supernormal returns or not” he sayshe’s most animated talking about heavyweight products that take patience and piles of cash to develop weigh tons and last for years — nextgeneration jet engines power turbines locomotives nuclear plants watertreatment systems medicalimaging equipment solar panels and windmills mr immelt notes for example that the cost of a goodsized solarpanel plant about  million is more than twice the total investment in google in the six years before it went public in the costs and complexities of such businesses he adds make it hard for just any company to compete these are markets he says that have “big moats they’re tough to get in”the bigmoat businesses can also be quite lucrative mr immelt points to ge’s jetengine business as an example saying that it has higher profit margins and returns on capital than the leading banks “it doesn’t happen every quarter or every year” he says “but over a  or year time period the businesses that are hard to do had the best returns so the arithmetic works over time”technologybased manufacturing of all sorts mr immelt says has to be a central part of reinvigorating the economy in speeches and position papers mr immelt a member of the white house’s economic recovery advisory board has called for doubling manufacturing employment in america to  percent of the work force which he concedes is an “aspirational” goalmaking progress he adds will require significantly improving the nation’s prowess as an exporter ge by the way happens to be america’s secondlargest exporter after boeing so mr immelt’s views about what changes would benefit the economy would probably help ge as well“many bought into the idea that america could go from a technologybased exportoriented powerhouse to a servicesled consumptionbased economy — and somehow still expect to prosper” mr immelt said in a typical speech last year before the detroit economic club “that idea was flat wrong” he added “our economy tilted instead toward the quicker profits of financial services”mr immelt is backing his words with actions — plans announced over the last  months include the creation of more than  jobs in manufacturing production and research in the united states they include new factory jobs in kentucky ohio new york alabama and mississippi for making products including energythrifty washers and dryers fluorescent light bulbs sodium batteries environmental coatings and jet engines and the company is opening a research center in michigan for advanced manufacturing technologies advertisement continue reading the main story “the underlying dna of ge going back a century has been to invest for growth in its technology base” says noel tichy a professor at the university of michigan business school who once ran ge’s management school in crotonville ny “so by increasing r d spending and with investments in manufacturing jeff immelt is going ‘back to the future’ at ge”about  miles from corporate headquarters inside a gleaming new plant that is the result of a  million threeyear investment ge’s backtobasics strategy is on displaythe spotless factory in batesville miss spans  square

with a ge logo and dark pants production is organized around the concept of “highperformance work teams” typically six to  workersit’s a bottomup approach that shuns hierarchy and places most of the responsibility for continuous improvement on the teams an egalitarian ethos is reflected in the job titles the boss jeanne edwards is the “plant leader” line workers are called “production associates” there are no supervisors here only “leaders” and “coaches” there aren’t many of those anyway — all but  workers are hourly employees and production associates start at about  a yearthe team approach seems to be working workers and coaches steadily look for ways to tweak the production process for greater efficiency since production began last year the manufacturing “cycle time” — from cutting

must first take a reading math and problemsolving test administered by the state employment agency candidates who do well are then invited for interviews at the plant and are evaluated in team settings for example they are placed in groups of four and told to assemble a lego helicopter in  minutes advertisement continue reading the main story “we want to see how they interact how they work together” says terry collins the plant’s human resources leader “we don’t give a heck about making the helicopter”the workers hired so far come from varied backgrounds some from more regimented factory settings recruits from traditional factories says ms edwards the plant leader “often tend to have some trouble at first”audra harris  left a job as a machine operator at a commercial roofing manufacturer to come to the ge plant in her first months ms harris says she initially found the team approach “very challenging” but adapted quickly “here you get to make a lot of decisions” she sayssteve lentz  who had worked in a printing factory and a bottling factory before joining ge says the large investment in a hightech facility proved that the company had a longterm commitment “i figured i could wrap up my career here” he says “at other places you don’t know when the shoe will drop”jeffrey parker  was hired last year a college graduate he had never set foot in a manufacturing plant before and had worked as a mortgage broker for countrywide financialhe says his perception of manufacturing work was laborers tethered to machines doing boring repetitive tasks in grimy

says should be guided by “a point of view about what’s going on in the world and you invest around that point of view”one big trend that corporations must embrace he notes is the “reordering of the global economy” in a talk to students at the stanford business school this year mr immelt observed that when he was a young executive moving up the ranks at ge in the s developed nations accounted for  percent of worldwide economic growth in the coming decade he told the students emerging markets are expected to deliver  percent of global growthunder mr immelt ge has sharply expanded its overseas sales to  billion last year from  billion in  but the company has fallen short of some of its ambitious goals for even higher growth especially in markets like india and china to accelerate the growth abroad mr immelt last month reassigned john g rice a vice chairman to hong kong where he will oversee sales marketing and operations outside the united states advertisement continue reading the main story mr immelt has expressed frustration about the difficulties of doing business in china especially in industries that beijing has marked as priorities to the nation’s economic development in a meeting with a group of italian business executives in rome in july he told the group according to the financial times “i really worry about china i am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win or any of us to be successful”ge has said the remarks were taken out of context and do not represent the company’s viewand mr immelt now offers a more subtle assessment saying that china is too large and complex to approach in a cookiecutter way “i defy anybody to say they have a onechina strategy” he says “i defy anyone”in some markets in china he says ge will be guided solely by whether chinese rivals are weak or strong but in industries like solar and wind power that are a focus of beijing’s fiveyear economic plans for example competitive tactics need to be finetuned to adapt to state policy“is it a strategic industry or one that is going to be allowed to commercialize on its own” mr immelt saysthe approach to china he says isn’t so different from the approach used in foreign markets where ge has been for decades and prospered “is france a completely open market to ge no of course not” mr immelt observes “i think we’re more discerning about china because it’s china and they’re big and they’re more concerning but the best global companies are ones that are nuanced”being nuanced in foreign markets he says is a skill that “i think we’re pretty good at”mr immelt also sees himself as the champion of what he calls “largescale entrepreneurship” at ge by that he means identifying longterm market shifts — “what’s next” he says — and then marshaling the company’s research manufacturing and marketing resources to capitalize on the opportunity he firmly believes that corporate size when focused can be a crucial advantage in the hightech industrial markets where ge competes“it’s about using the scale of ge the majesty of the company to drive growth and change” he saysmr immelt’s leadership style according to colleagues and advisers is a blend of analysis encouragement cajoling and sometimes orders by decree he grew up in cincinnati where his father joseph once managed ge’s aircraft engine business he attended dartmouth college majored in applied mathematics was elected president of his fraternity and played tackle on the football team advertisement continue reading the main story next came a short stint at procter  gamble nearby sat another aspiring business leader steven a ballmer now chief executive of microsoft mr ballmer recalls mr immelt as bright energetic and engaging company during afterwork dinners and barhopping after little contact for years mr ballmer says the two have “really reconnected” in the last decade after they both became chief executives of leading american corporations getting together for dinners and rounds of golf sharing thoughts on leadership and managementmr ballmer observes that they both took over from revered successful leaders — mr welch at ge and bill gates at microsoft — just after the stock market had peaked and that investors have had lingering doubts about the outlook for both companies despite solid results in most years“even if you’re doing a good job it doesn’t always get reported that way” mr ballmer notesafter p g mr immelt went to harvard business school for an mba a math whiz his favorite subject was finance but when he graduated in  he turned down a job offer from morgan stanley opting for an industrial company — and the one where his father had built a career — over wall street at ge he began climbing the ranksrelaxed and affable he is routinely described as “comfortable in his own skin” in his autobiography mr welch wrote that he selected mr immelt as his successor because “i felt jeff had the perfect blend of intelligence and edge and epitomized the trait that’s so important to me — he was really comfortable in his own skin”the ge campaign to promote energyefficient products begun in  and called ecomagination is a model of mr immelt’s efforts to push largescale change it began because he believed that energy efficiency and alternative energy sources were growth markets and that ge should capitalize on those trendsto find new ideas mr immelt spends much of his time traveling and talking to customers industry partners government officials and analystsmr immelt according to beth comstock senior vice president and chief marketing officer at ge is constantly scouting for opportunity “he says ‘hey i think there’s something here’ ” ms comstock says “let’s see what we can do” when he gets excited teams are dispatched to assess markets products and research and technology trends typically in a few weeks or less advertisement continue reading the main story when the campaign began some inside and outside of ge dismissed it as a marketing gimmick and internal employee surveys found little enthusiasm for it “ecomagination had a favorability rating of like one when it started maybe two me and beth” mr immelt recalls amused “so it was like two against  the first day”but momentum built gradually especially as more ge products delivered energy savings and market acceptance today products that qualify for the ecomagination label total  billion in sales one example ge not only sells a hybrid locomotive but also is building a battery plant in upstate new york that will employ  workers its production is intended for fuelefficient locomotives and backup power supplies for data centers and telecommunications switching stations ge hopes to make industrial batteries a  billionayear business“that was totally jeff immelt” says mark little who oversees ge’s research efforts and led the locomotive effort “the kinds of things that cut across business units — or have no natural home in a business — are not natural acts for us and he makes sure they happen”occasionally mr immelt just issues an order after a trip to brazil in january he became convinced that the country was rapidly advancing in technology and that ge should place a research lab there when he returned to the united states he told mr little as mr immelt recalls “hey dude you’re going to put a global research center in brazil pick a good place” last month ge announced it would build a research center in rio de janeiroleadership by fiat when done in moderation mr immelt says can drive change and set a course “i think that if you run a big company you’ve got to four or five times a year just say ‘hey team look here’s where we’re going’ ” he says “if you do it  times nobody wants to work for you if you do it zero times you have anarchy”despite the financial crisis and recession mr immelt has kept investing for the long haul research and development spending increased last year to  billion and will be still higher this year “it would have been easy to say times are tough and we’ll pull back on research spending and longrange projects but he didn’t do any of that” says vijay govindarajan a professor at the tuck school of business at dartmouth and a former consultant to ge “jeff immelt really held onto his technologyledinnovation agenda”ge’s management traditions emphasize patience and its leaders typically have long tenures mr welch was at the helm for two decades and mr immelt  has been in charge for nearly a decade a winter or two of discontent is not cause for dismissal but the stock price which closed at  on friday is less than half its level when mr immelt took over in  the stock has barely budged in the last year as ge slowly climbs back from the financial crisisthere is no indication of a restive board yet shareholders are waiting to see better days from the battered stock of ge long the bluest of blue chip companies under mr immelt the company has pared its offerings — the plastics business was sold off the majority stake in nbc universal is being sold to comcast and of course ge capital has been whittled down advertisement continue reading the main story the nearterm prospects for ge’s stock seem to depend if not on financial engineering then at least on financial moves that might lift the dividend back toward its precrisis levels the nbc sale to comcast could bring  billion in cash and negotiating with mr buffett to buy back his  billion in preferred stock which pays a  percent dividend could free up  million in yearly fees those steps could clear the way to raising the dividend and making the stock fetching again for investors“that’s the fulcrum for ge stock until the economy strengthens and the industrial business really gets rolling again” says nicholas heymann an analyst for sterne agee  leachmr immelt observes that ge’s stock which climbed above  in  before the crisis kicked in has mirrored how investors have viewed financial services over the last decade that’s a perception mr immelt hopes to change as he reemphasizes ge’s manufacturing prowess and reins in the financial operation“as we come out of the recession we’re going to see if the moves to streamline the portfolio will pay off” says steven winoker an analyst for sanford c bernstein  company “we haven’t seen positive results yet”for his part mr immelt is an optimist “we’re going to be one of the companies that comes out of the crisis stronger than we went in” he says “i think that is something that is ultimately going to be good for employees and investors” continue reading the main story

familiar with those conversations in an interview mr brennan — a former chief executive of vanguard a large mutual fund firm — said “i talk to investors all the time and given my background i get a lot of unsolicited advice”investors’ calls for change increased noticeably two years ago when nelson peltz an activist shareholder and his investment firm trian bought a  billion stake making it one

predecessor who served for two decades and oversaw an era of tremendous global expansion that emphasis on financial businesses continued for years under mr immelt — until the  crisissuddenly finance

share this article on linkedin share this article on twitter share this article on facebook email this article download this article in this first installment of our twopart interview general electric chairman and ceo jeff immelt explains why industrial companies are now in the information business—whether they like it or not video five years ago us corporate giant general electric had to decide how to respond to the digitization of the industrial sector build or buy as chairman and chief executive officer jeff immelt reveals in this interview with mckinsey’s rik kirkland ge decided to build and has since added thousands of staff and embraced data and analytics as the driving force transforming its operations globally it’s a bold push driven by immelt’s belief that the storied company founded  years ago in schenectady new york must shape its own future in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape an edited transcript of his comments follows interview transcript digitizing in the industrial space we think about this as digitization of the industrial world we as a company didn’t go to bed one night and say “we can’t be an industrial company anymore we need to be more like oracle we need to be more like microsoft” it happened more on an evolutionary basis really based on the industries we’re in and the technology we serve you think about a jet engine today or a locomotive or an mri scanner a new jet engine might have a hundred sensors on it these sensors have the capability to take continuous data about the heat of an engine fuel consumption the wear of the blades the environment it’s taking off in—a series of things and one flight between new york city and chicago produces a terabyte of data so industrial companies are in the information business whether they want to be or not this is going to happen in the industrial space now add to that a series of decisions every company needs to make “do i outsource all of that do i do it myself do i change my business model accordingly” the decision we’ve made is that we just want to be all in we want to treat analytics like it’s as core to the company over the next  years as material science has been over the past  years we can hire the talent we can evolve our business model accordingly we need to treat our service agreements to share outcomes with our customers the same way an it company might approach that in the future so in order to do that we have to add technology we have to add people we have to change our business models we have to be willing to do all those things but the point i’d make to people is if you think about today  percent or  percent of the sp  valuation is consumer internet stocks that didn’t exist  or  years ago the consumer companies got none of that when you look at retailers banks consumerproduct companies they got none of that if you look out  or  years and say that same value is going to be created in the industrial internet do you as an industrial company want to sit there and say “i don’t want any of that i’m going to let a newco or some other company get all that” is that really what you’ve relegated yourself to so i think all these things led us to say “let’s build it let’s see if we can be good at it we may be wrong we don’t think so but we may be wrong but let’s not sit back and just say ‘look that’s somebody else’s job’ or ‘we’re not good enough to do it’ or ‘we can’t change’” we’re unwilling to take that as a fait accompli building versus buying we went through a process of “make versus buy” “in versus out” we basically said “look do we want to make a big acquisition in analytics or it” and we analyzed a bunch of different cases and said “we don’t have the foundation inside the company to do a big acquisition do we want to partner or do we want to do it ourselves” we have lots of good software partners but basically we said “we need to do this ourselves let’s err on the side of seeing if we could approach it in that way” that was  so we brought people in from the outside we built a center in california we started populating our businesses roll forward we started doing applications with customers we started building it into our service business things like that i could give you a bunch of different analogies but in the case of our locomotive customers they have a phrase called “velocity” every ceo of a railroad could tell you their velocity the velocity tends to be let’s say between  and  miles per hour this tends to be the average miles per hour that a locomotive travels in a day— doesn’t seem very good and the difference between  and  for let’s say norfolk southern is worth  million in annual profit that’s huge for a company like that that’s one mile per hour so that’s all about scheduling better it’s all about less downtime it’s all about not having broken wheels being able to get through chicago faster that’s all analytics being a platform company and an app company inside in the company we’re about  billion in revenue—this is from software analytical applications things like that we’ve built up a population of applications we’re approaching  million of productivity a year now what we’re trying to do is push that back inside the company we’re selling it but we want to get our own internal company on the same basis on the same platform using the same skills—what we call the “digital thread” we want the digital thread to go from engineering all the way through our installed base we’ve made the decision that we’re going to try to be both a platform company and an application company so we have a platform called predix and we’re building applications on top of that we’re probably the only industrial company that’s actually trying to do its own and we’re opening up our platform to our customers we’re saying to our customers “look if you want to write apps applications on predix you’re free to do it” i always think risk first like most ceos i basically say to investors “look if all we did is we got more productivity higher service sales applications you guys are going to love this if we end up having the platform that works it’s a whole new company you know so you get that for free” but that’s why i circle back and would say to any ceo industrial or nonindustrial that where we are right now is going to be the most important thing that you’re going to work on at least in this era and you give up your latitude at your own peril hiring the right people we have probably hired since we started this a couple thousand data scientists and people like that that’s going to continue to grow and multiply what we’ve found is we’ve got to hire new product managers different kinds of commercial people it’s going to be in the thousands so what you’re going to do is you’re going to blend them with the ge team and then we’re going to recruit differently when we go to college campuses we’re going to look for different skills we’re going to put them in different training programs it’s a combination of we’ve got to bring our culture along but that’s not enough we’ve got to bring thousands of people in from the outside that’s the only way we’re going to get there fast enough this is something i got wrong i thought it was all about technology i thought if we hired a couple thousand technology people if we upgraded our software things like that that was it i was wrong product managers have to be different salespeople have to be different onsite support has to be different we’ve had to drill and change a lot about the company and i just think it’s infecting everything we do it’s infecting our own it it’s infecting our own manufacturing plants it’s infected everything we’re doing i think in a positive way changing company culture when you think about internal change—culture people leadership development—again here’s a time where multiple things happened at the same time we started our digital initiative maybe five or six years ago we’ve also as a company—and i don’t think ge’s unique—lived through the financial crisis and we’re an old company we live in highly regulated industries what we found was our culture was too complicated to get the work done the way we needed to get our work done both in terms of how we were trying to digitize and how we were trying to survive in terms of a more highly regulated world and just think about our footprint and the complexity of running a global operation even since i was ceo ge has gone from  percent inside the united states to  percent outside the united states so what we’ve tried to do inside the company is really just drive what we call a “culture of simplification” fewer layers fewer processes fewer decision points we’ve adapted the lean tools in what i would call a silicon valley approach what we call “fast works” we’ve embraced some of the silicon valley tools in terms of putting everything on the clock bringing commercial intensity into the company the way i describe that is like most big companies we’re willing to take all kinds of market risk so that we don’t have to take internal risk right we try to say “look let’s actually be aggressive in the markets and let’s count on our own execution to risk reduce inside the company” and broadly getting to digitization we’re democratizing information inside the company getting it tools that were contemporary in a mobile setting and we call these things the culture of simplification my notion is we’re in a permanently complex world and this historical organization chart with lots of processes is a thing of the past we’ve basically unplugged anything that was annual the notion is that in the digital age sitting down once a year to do anything is weird it’s just bizarre so whether it’s doing business reviews or strategic planning it’s in a much more continuous way we still give a lot of feedback we still do a lot of analysis of how you’re performing but we make it much more contemporary and much more degree so somebody can get interactions with their boss on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis and the data you get is being collected by your peers the people who work for you in a

family job september  was horrific but ive been through enough crises before that i had my own pattern as to how to collect facts what a leader should do how to communicate with people how to set up operating mechanisms to work our way through it jeffrey r immelt work leader people id be lying if i didnt say there were days when i went back and said i wish id done this i should have done that i handled this the wrong way but its always in the motivation of getting better ive never once looked in the mirror and said oh boy cant do this one jeffrey r immelt mirror motivation wish i love working with customers sales has really influenced everything i do it has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense of urgency and listening to people jeffrey r immelt love listening sales many bought into the idea that america could go from a technologybased exportoriented powerhouse to a servicesled consumptionbased economy  and somehow still expect to prosper that idea was flat wrong our economy tilted instead toward the quicker profits of financial services jeffrey r immelt financial america economy is france a completely open market to ge no of course not i

cincinnati ohio and my parents are really right wingers my dad watches like five or six hours of fox news every day and stuff like that jeffrey r immelt dad parents day i think we should have basically the same tax policy that germany japan the uk everybody else has which is a tax rate in the mids and no loopholes zero the us has the most antiquated tax system and that means some people

think of and i am like god that did everything that i wanted it to do jeffrey r immelt business god i am when i was a young guy when i first started with ge jack welch sent us all to japan because in those days japan was gonna crush us and we learned a lot about japan when we were there but over the subsequent  years the japanese companies all fell behind and the reason why they fell behind is because they didnt globalize jeffrey r immelt young why over every leader needs to clearly explain the top three things the organization is working on if you cant then youre not leading well jeffrey r immelt leader organization you there is no real magic to being a good leader but at the end of every week you have to spend your time around the things that are really important setting priorities

presidents council on jobs and competitiveness jeffrey r immelt me new chair business leaders should provide expertise in service of our country my predecessors at ge have done so as have leaders of many other great american companies jeffrey r immelt business great service as one of americas largest exporters ge remains committed to producing more products in the united states which is our home and largest market jeffrey r immelt home america more ge sells more than  percent of its products to the private sector where americas future must be built but government can help business invest in our shared future jeffrey r immelt business future government you can stay too long in a job thats for sure but by the same token in the  years i have been ceo of ge there have been four ceos of
