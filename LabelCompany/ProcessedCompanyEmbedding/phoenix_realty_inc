against a strict criteria the applicants are then run through a national criminal database as well as a national evictions database additionally applicants then have their income verified as well as a positive rental history or proof of homeownership for more specific criteria relating to how applicants are screened please contact our office today how long of a lease do you sign most lease terms normally last twelve months longer or shorter leases may be offered in an attempt to allow the lease term to expire in the spring and summer months when rental activity is at its highest this is typical of a lease that commences in a slower time of year can you put the money directly into my account phoenix realty and property management inc deposits all available rental funds into owner accounts via direct deposit by the th of every month how do i know you won’t spend my money on large repairs without my approval this is the greatest fear and a legitimate concern for most owners per our management agreement we contractually promise not to authorize repairs in excess of  without your approval ordinary maintenance and repairs of less than  are paid out of your account and you will see this in your monthly statement if we think a repair might exceed  we often do our best to contact you to discuss the nature of the repairs however if we are unable to reach you we may initiate repair work even if it is higher than  but less than  additionally as stated in the management agreement we may authorize a repair for over  only if one of the following cases is present  the health or safety of a tenant is an issue  the property will incur damage if immediate action is not taken  in instances where there is only one option to consider  we would only be acting in your the owners best interest who holds the tenant security deposit all security deposits are held in our deposit trust account until the end of the tenancy at the end of the tenancy phoenix realty and property management inc will inspect the property and determine the applicability of any security deposit funds itemizing any withdraws and returning to the tenant within the bounds of colorado law am i required to make my property available to section  per colorado law you are not required to make your property available to section  as a company policy phoenix realty and property management inc does not accept section  tenants can i use a home warranty company for repairs is that ok we prefer that the owners do not use a home warranty company to make repairs at their rental property we have had lots of problems with home warranties you don’t have control over who does the work and neither do we the home warranty provider contracts with local service companies to perform the actual inspections and repairs you don’t get to choose and scheduling repairs can sometimes be very difficult sometimes the service technician may also try to sell you unneeded services as well as require payment at time of service which is not a responsibility that should be placed on your tenant so what is a homeowner to do many consumer advocates would say it’s better to “selfinsure” — setting aside a reasonable sum each year to cover routine maintenance and finding reliable local contractors to do the work however if your appliances are relatively new and carry a manufacturer’s warranty we will do our best to honor the warranty but not at the expense of providing reasonable and reliable service to the tenant remember happy tenants mean less tenant turnover and lower costs how soon can you start managing my property we can start the process immediately contact us so we can find out more about you and your property and see if we would be a good match for your wants and expectations do you sell real estate too we most certainly do as previously mentioned all of our employees are licensed real estate brokers and realtors® if you are interested in buying or selling a property please

accredited buyer representatives and cbr certified buyer representatives licenses additional certifications or degrees like an mba jd cfa or cpa are a plus as they demonstrate competence in dealing with complex transactions  will they guarantee letting you out of a contract if the relationship isn’t workingin few cases the buyer and the real estate agent cannot coexist based on personality or philosophical differences in these rare events you should feel comfortable that your real estate agent will let you out of your contract immediately and allow you to pursue a relationship with another buyers agent in the area  what are your fees and how do you get paidin most cases real estate agent fees are paid by the seller of the home you as the home buyer will most likely not have to pay
