those statements in addition the information reported on this call speaks only as of today april   and therefore you’re advised that time sensitive information may no longer be accurate as of the time of any replay with that i’ll turn the call over to roe patterson president and ceo thomas monroe patterson thanks jack and welcome to those of you dialing in for today’s call we appreciate your interest in our company joining me today is alan krenek our chief financial officer today i’ll briefly recap first quarter results and give a current overview alan will then discuss our financial results in more detail i’ll then wrap things up with some final comments about what we’re currently anticipating for the second quarter and the reminder of  i won’t dive deep into our operating segments i think the information is readily available in our release and public filings this should allow more time for questions if necessary i would also like to announce that we’ll be suspending our monthly operating updates instead we’ll rely on our investor presentations and quarterly releases for operational updates turning to our company status and first quarter results as i’ve said in previous calls this industry downturn has been unprecedented both in terms of link and the decline in activity levels while this current period holds different characteristics from the mid s or the late s it has been equally devastating to our industry our extensive efforts to reduce cost limit capital spending preserve liquidity and scale our business to fit any level of customer activity have been proactive and successful however as the reduction in activity mounted like all service companies we were unable to get ahead of the decline no matter how proactive we tried to be i want to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts and sacrifices to help the company in this process these efforts are now beginning to have a meaningful impact the measures we have put in place and continue to add to extend our runway and should put us in a strong position upon a recovery we’re fortunate to have a young fleet of equipment that has been well maintained even the units we’ve enforced to cold stack are being maintained in a way that should keep our reactivation cost lower than most service providers as an example we’ve stacked over  hydraulic horsepower to date and we routinely operate these units so they’ll be in optimal condition when we need them we’ve remained one of the toughest competitors in all of our legacy markets by striving to be the service company with the lowest cost structure we’ve seen an increasing level of attrition within the ranks of our competitors as activity declines in contrast our utilization hasn’t experienced the same pace of decline and has even remained stable in some business lines this is why we believe we have gained market share in some segments this result is attributable to our outstanding local leaders and field employees the first quarter did not start as we had originally anticipated we had expectations that the growing inventory of maintenance and workover projects that were differed at the end of  would be completed in the first quarter even though these projects offer the lowest cost per barrel of all capex options available to our clients to different dips in wti prices below the  mark kept customers spending in decline this drop in oil prices compounded with some severe weather impact caused revenue to fall by  sequentially we also saw some frac projects in western oklahoma get delayed by some regulatory issues related to injection wells while we have no injection wells in this particular area we do provide frac services so we felt the impact of this project correspondence the good news is that we’ve started to see an improvement in production related activity in late march which has continued in april this increase has been seen mainly in our well servicing and fluid services segments it seems today’s prices have at least offered the possibility of financial returns to justify some maintenance activity we still believe there is a large inventory in differed maintenance and workover projects in all of our markets that should come back quickly if commodity prices continue to stabilize we’re pleased to have such a large portion of our fleet dedicated to these ongoing production businesses this allows us to stay steadily busy when customer stop spending money at the drill bit on frac work these improvements in utilization should flow quickly to the bottom line as we’ve substantially lowered our fixed cost preservation of liquidity has been and continuous to be one of our highest priorities we spent approximately  million on capex in the first quarter and half of that amount was rollover projects from the fourth quarter of  in our february call we mentioned capex of  million for  at this time we anticipate that our capex will be well below this original amount we continue to lower our field level cost and we have reduced headcount by approximately  from the peaks of  sga expenses are down by over  million per quarter from our peak levels in  we also reset payroll taxes in the first quarter of every year this year that impact resulted in about  basis points of margin decline for the first quarter this impact will diminish in the second quarter assuming further improvements in utilization and not including interest expense payments we still expect to get the company to cash flow breakeven by the end of  we continue to evaluate all options available for delevering including strategic combinations and debt restructuring while there is no new update on this front it is a top priority in our list of financial objectives with that i will turn the call over to alan alan krenek thanks roe this morning i will provide additional details on our first quarter income statement as well as discuss selected balance sheet and cash flow items as customary when making comparison comments will focus on sequential changes first i would like to cover a few components of our revenue and segment profit in our well servicing segment taylor rig manufacturing generated  million in revenue compared to  million in the fourth quarter taylor segment net operating margin was  compared to operating margin loss of  in the fourth quarter in the completion and remedial segment for the first quarter compared to the prior quarter  of the revenue was generated from pumping services compared to   from coil tubing compared to   from rental tools compared to  and  from other services in both quarters the reported net loss for the first quarter was  million or  per share excluding the impact of special items covered in the earnings release we reported an adjusted net loss of  million or a  per share this compares to a net loss of  million or a loss of  per share in the fourth quarter weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter were  million adjusted ebitda was a negative  million or  of revenue compared to a negative  million or  revenue in the fourth quarter ga expense in the first quarter was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the prior quarter the lower ga was due to significant cost saving initiatives including headcount reductions and lower incentive compensation bad debt expense was  in the first quarter please note that we have made significant progress on lowering our ga expense since the fourth quarter of  when it was  million we expect ga expense in the second quarter to be around  million as we benefit from additional cost reductions that were implemented in the first quarter we expect ga expense to be further reduced to around  million per quarter in the second half of this year from additional plan costsaving initiatives depreciation and amortization expense declined to  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter we expect that depreciation and amortization expense for the rest of the year to be around  million per quarter net interest expense was  million in the first quarter compared to  million in the prior quarter interest expense included a partial quarter’s worth of interest associated with the  million term note that was completed in late february on an asreported basis interest expense was  million this amount includes  million of deferred debt cost that were written off in conjunction with the reduction of our revolving credit facility from  million to  million we expect quarterly net interest expense to be  million on a goforward basis the operating tax benefit rate for the first quarter was  this does not include evaluation allowance of  million related to a temporary impairment of the company’s tax intervals we expect the operating tax benefit rate to be  for the full year of  our cash balance was  million at march  compared to  million at december  we had  million of restricted cash  million of this is from our term loan that will be made available in almost equal portions at the end of may and august as we satisfy certain postclosing conditions of our term loan in addition during the first quarter we used  million to cash collateralize a portion of our letters of credit as our borrowing base on our revolving credit facility had been reduced because of lower accounts receivable we expect that situation to correct itself in the nearterm and bring the  million back to unrestricted cash several other items to note in connection with the term loan we reimbursed on lenders for  million for their expenses and we incurred  million of expenses on our side net change in working capital in the first quarter was impacted by a larger than normal reductions in accounts payable including liabilities as the majority of our annual profit taxes are due in the first quarter we expect working capital changes to be somewhat neutral in the near term no amount was outstanding under our  million revolving credit facility at march  and we had  million of availability of which  million was subject to leverage covenants we had  million of letters of credit outstanding at march  playing at december st after we file our q early next week we expect to close on the additional  million delayed draw as per our term loan agreement our dso at the end of march was  down from  at the end of december our over days receivables represent  of our accounts receivable balance at march  we continue to experience good collection results despite the current operating environment total debt at march  was  billion of which  million was classified as current a new accounting standard update now requires that debt issuance cost to be presented as an offset to the curing value of our debt total debt at march  is comprised of the following term loan due in  of  million senior notes due in  of  million senior notes due in  of  million capital leases of  million and unamortized premium on the  senior notes of  this is offset by the term loan discount of  million and  million of unamortized debt issuance cost on the senior notes during the fourth quarter total capital expenditures were  million which included  million for expansion projects  million for sustaining and replacement projects and  million for other expansion spending included  for well servicing  for fluid services and  for the completion and remedial segment roe has already discussed our expectations for capital spending for  our main focus as we move through  will be to preserve our liquidity we have made significant progress on reducing cost throughout the organization we will look at further reducing infrastructure costs by evaluating less profitable operating locations and taking appropriate actions at this point i will return the call back over to roe thomas monroe patterson thanks alan the first quarter was impacted by steep dips in wti pricing and weather interruptions but it ended with some very positive signs in production related activity looking forward in the second quarter we expect oil prices to remain choppy but we also expect some improvements in our utilization levels better weather and longer daylight hours should contribute to this result our cost cutting initiatives are paying dividends and we’re starting to see the effects go through our financial statement if we continue to execute on our current strategy i believe we will attain our goals for cash flow by yearend i’m not forecasting the recovery or when it occurs or at what price obviously lower service costs present better financial returns for our customers in a lower commodity price environment so oil shouldn’t have to get to  a barrel before we see some improvements in activity as i’ve said before the gating item will be labor the longer our industry stays in this present condition the longer it will take service providers to respond to any increased demand because of the experienced personal in our industry has lost in addition activity levels won’t react until confidence and more importantly credit return in to the emp space it appears the second half of  is the soonest we could see this pattern shift once recovery does set in rates for our services could rise quickly as accrued equipment will be in short supply and it will take improved pricing to unstack any idle equipment this is why we are working hard to retain market share retain key employees and keep our equipments in great shape we expect to be in a very opportunistic position as activity levels rise that’s the end of our prepared remarks so i’ll turn the call over to questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of marshall adkins with raymond james please proceed with your question marshall adkins roe i know you’re not forecasting recovery but i am so i want to get a little more color on the status of your fleet and the ability to respond to an upturn in next year in  specifically i know you got a lot of stack horsepower and some stack workover rigs how much is it going to cost you to get that going again then maybe some commentary on the rest of the industry’s as well thomas monroe patterson okay well i will tell you what we’re doing we have a monthly program for every single piece of equipment at stack this includes our blenders hydration units all the pumps frack band you name it we start it we turn it we try to engage the horsepower as much as we can to put it under some stress so that we keep the equipment in the most optimal shape that we can put it in obviously if we are not hooked up anything and pressuring it up pumping on it’s hard to put a load on the equipment but we do the best we can to make sure it is in great operating condition we do that every single month there is a cost associated with that and all the stacked horsepower is out there in the rest of the country especially stuff that is buried in the back of these yards that’s not happening into that stuff so i’m glad it happened to our equipment and i’m glad we have been able to do it right now we think  we track piece of equipment and the cost we think to bring each piece of the equipment back up to what we’d call the perfect condition ready to deploy we still think that number is under about  on the dollar versus replacement cost it is about  for us right now versus what we think the replacement cost is which is about somewhere in the neighborhood of about  to  per horsepower so that’s what we have done with that particular equipment we feel like unstacking it won’t be the problem finding crews for it will be the problem marshall adkins so if kind of stay on that line of question for a minute we’ve heard from a lot of industry players that there is a meaningful deterioration their ability of the horsepower and specifically to come back online it sounds like at least your thought processes is it is going to cost lot to get your fleet you haven’t had really any attrition in your fleet but everyone else’s seems to be having attrition some in a huge way how do i reconcile the difference there indiscernible are you working it different way or what is the difference thomas monroe patterson well we have worked ours differently during the peak we did a lot of lower horsepower work which extended the life on our equipment that is number one number two we do have a very new fleet we bought a lot of horsepower in  and  so that’s stuff as we  as it come down was pretty new i wouldn’t say our attrition level is zero we have got some older pumps that probably never go back to work but it is pretty small amount of our overall fleet i would attribute the rest of the attrition with overall industry fleet to how much of that horsepower was already at the end of its useful life when it got stacked to begin with so the dollar amount to bring that stuff back to work is considerably more than  on the dollar versus replacement cost it’s probably running  to    of new cost at that point you are better off building a new pump not thinking all that money into an old pump so there is a huge portion of the  million or so horsepower that was out there that was already at the end of the useful life when we stacked it during  as an industry so i think that the portion that is probably people don’t recognize as quickly then you got some other fleets out there some of our competitors we have seen stack their equipments cannibalize their equipment  they may talk about a stack fleet that is ready to go back to work when you look at it it’s missing engines it is missing transmissions the fluids in all robbed of off it i mean you’re talking about some primary components they’re missing you’re talking about some big capex dollars to get that stuff back into usable shape well that’s not is going to be the fleet that our customer goes why really want that one i want that fleet that’s missing radiators and engines they are going to want the fleet that you can turn it on pretty quick and go back to work if they are going to pay to unstack some horsepower so i think if you can keep your fleet in that shape and i know some competitors that are doing just that they’re doing what we’re doing that horsepower comes back pretty quick but the attrition level across the industry is far greater than most people have given it credit there is a lot of horsepower that never come back to work because we chew through it for replacement components as any oems out there they are not selling a lot of replacement components so we are using up that stuff as an industry and a lot of that horsepower was at the end of its useful life when we stacked it at the end of ‘ anyway and through ‘ marshall adkins that’s great color one last one for me you mentioned the labor side is probably going to be constrained how do we know  it’s not like we have been hiring a bunch of people and i’ve heard the same thing from a lot of other players as well but i’m just curious how do we know that labor  it seems like people show up out of the woodwork when there is an upturn but everyone is in consensus it’s a little bit different i just want to know why that is or why do you think that is thomas monroe patterson i think the length of the downturn is probably going to be the biggest impact on our ability to try to get rehire is done some of the folks have been burned by the industry pretty good and they are not just going to come back they’ve got stable  if you look at the unemployment rates across the country especially in texas oklahoma and new mexico these people went and found other work so because the unemployment rates didn’t jackup as we laid them off and i think that stable income and other markets that aren’t as volatile as ours is probably pretty attractive for some some will come back the dollars will bring them back and they will come back we just think it is going to be a small number and we think that the rest of the workforce that we have to crew up this idle equipment with will be pretty green efficiencies will go down we’ll have a training period where we have to teach those new employees how to run the equipment and how to behave in our industry and not get hurt it’s a process it doesn’t happen overnight we’re talking months maybe even a year or more to be able to recruit a lot of this equipment it will be a huge gating item just trying to attract that labor back in to the market we throw enough money at it we’ll get some good people back but remember if we are going to throw money at it we are going to raise rates too because the factors ph can’t afford but to pay any higher wages without some of offset in rate marshall adkins great job roe thank you thomas monroe patterson thanks operator our next question comes from the line of jason wangler with wunderlich securities please proceed with your question jason wangler good morning thomas monroe patterson good morning jason jason wangler i was just curious on the taylor side looked like you had a nice bump there could you maybe just walk through what you’re seeing in on that end thomas monroe patterson you know most of the activity is nonoilfield related right now and it is basically manufacturing of water well rigs so that’s what you are seeing you’re not seeing any well servicing or rig activity jason wangler okay that’s helpful that’s kind of where i was curious about and then just on the  it seems like the production side is holding up a little bit better but on the completion side is it just still a focus from the emp companies just continually hitting on price is it competition coming in and you’re just cutting somehow even lower is it both just kind of where you are seeing those what seemed like continued pricing pressures despite the fact that you know we’re sitting where we are on the margin side thomas monroe patterson it’s just rig count less wells being drilled less work for these fracking companies that remain in the space so the number of bidders have less and less to bid on every single month every single week so they all get crowded into the same bidding space and that just keeps the lid on rates and makes it tighter and tighter and harder and harder to get that work there can only beat one winner i mean you can’t have three frack companies frack one well so we will only get one winner on each well and as the number of wells go down and decrease it just gets tougher and tougher to make a living in that business jason wangler well i guess maybe is it  are the ep i guess pushing i guess what i am asking are they sending out letters or are they coming after you guys and i need to cut it or is it i guess your competitors just continually cutting price i guess is what i’m curious on because i guess maybe it’s coming from both ends is all i’m just wondering about thomas monroe patterson no i don’t think pricing has come down much late in the last quarter or quarter and a half i think we’ve seen pricing pretty much bottom and the reason is because we are really very very close if not right at cash flow breakeven and in some cases some frackers have bid below what we think is cash flow breakeven so i think that prices just can’t go any lower customers always want lower prices so they are always asking but i haven’t seen a push any meaningful push letters or anything like that lately where they are asking for further discounts more than anything else they just don’t have anything to do they don’t have any work to do jason wangler that’s helpful thank you very much i’ll turn it back operator our next question comes from the line of matt marietta with stephens please proceed with your question chris denison hey guys this is chris denison on for matt marietta we are just wondering just talking about this inventory of maintenance workover projects could you just dive in a little more i mean what kind of opportunities are you seeing what’s maybe the magnitude that you would expect and how they play out if prices were to stabilize around current levels thomas monroe patterson well as the year wrapped up in  we saw more and more customers shut in wells that were say under  barrels a day and just not do the maintenance work if they had a pump go down or a rod part or some relatively minor maintenance item they just refused to fix it they just weren’t going to spend the money at sub  or sub  per barrel they just weren’t going to do it so they just said we’ll come back to it and i guess what we’ve seen is when prices have tipped up into the higher  range   above  customers have been more willing to go ahead and do some of that work we know that as we’ve heard and listened to customers talk about shutting in these wells and not doing that maintenance work that that inventory continues to grow or has grown so as we work that off if prices stabilize or go up from here it could mean for our utilization on the well servicing and fluid service side it could mean   basis points in utilization maybe more chris denison right understood and then on the oklahoma side i mean what do you guys see as the risk going forward here in relation to your frack projects and then any risk on the salt water disposal wells side thomas monroe patterson well we don’t have any swds in the area that’s kind of gotten all the scrutiny that’s fortunate but we do frack in that market for a couple of customers and right now the fracking is completely shut up it’s completely postponed we’ve got several wells to do in there if it ever comes back i think probably the solution is going to be injection of water in different zones rather than the zone that’s under the scrutiny so i think they will spread it out spread out the water into different zones and move it around rather than concentrating in one particular zone which is what they were doing before and that ought to alleviate a lot of the issues and the scrutiny on it i mean there is varying opinions out there whether you believe the science the injection wells are actually causing  inducing tremors and you can debate that all day but i think the solution will be some sort of compromise for water injection into different zones and that ought to happen sometime in the next six months or so chris denison right understood yeah i appreciate the color guys we’ll turn it back over thomas monroe patterson thanks operator our next question comes from the line of brian uhlmer with gmp securities please proceed with your question brian uhlmer very good morning gentlemen thomas monroe patterson good morning brian brian uhlmer i have a couple of easy ones for you you called out skim oil a few times in the pr what percent of your fluids business is related to those sales thomas monroe patterson yeah it’s not very much as a percentage but you have to realize that basically  brian uhlmer it’s all margins thomas monroe patterson it’s all margins so it typically had been running at about close to  million a quarter brian uhlmer okay thomas monroe patterson it was down in the first quarter brian uhlmer is that sort of at the spot rate in basin or is it generally discounts at that spot rate thomas monroe patterson it’s always a discount to post it always and discount can grow if pricing falls quickly the spread between skim oil price and posted can grow so it can come under some real pressure in a low price environment brian uhlmer right okay perfect also secondly a little more difficult question kind of walking through the imaginations of the  to  revenue decline sequentially can you walk us through where the majority of that decline is going to come through if we are above  here if the discussion would pretend us to believe that well servicing revenue should be at a minimum flat and potentially up this quarter so with almost all of that revenue decline become necessary from completion is that how to look at it thomas monroe patterson that’s correct that’s exactly how to look at it and look we’re giving you our best guess based on what we see right now we could get surprised and revenue could surprise to the upside we will see you just can’t throw the rig count decline or what you expect the rig count decline to be and layer it on top of what our revenue is going to be because so much more of our work is increasingly production related so if the rig count goes down which we expected to do our completions business will suffer and that’s what you see in our guidance what we are saying is we expect the increases in fluid services and well servicing to not quite offset the decreases we could see in the completion related segments brian uhlmer okay that makes sense now on the bright side if we go to marshall’s boom cycle in  can you walk us through the cash flows and your ability to ramp receivables as we go through that let’s just say you burn another  million bucks through the back the next three quarters and the cycle doesn’t pick up at all as we get into ‘ and pickup how do we finance those receivables and have you guys started looking at that and the methods to do that if you start to increase the revenue  to  in any given quarter thomas monroe patterson yeah i think we do in our models that we have developed for  we have been able to do it without having to have any additional borrowings other than utilizing the basically  million of our availability on the revolver when those receivables grow of course we have more availability so we would use that  million and we think we would have sufficient cash flow balance at the end of the year combined with the  million of availability on the revolver to expand a surge in revenues brian uhlmer and can you  sorry to keep going on that one but how does that revolver expand based on receivables is that already written into it and do you expect that you will be able to pretty easily expand if revenues do go up even greater clip that what the revolver could handle thomas monroe patterson well right now it’s pretty much set at the maximum amount once we take this  million of additional however as our intangible asset value grows then we have more availability under some of our indenture that would allow us to grow that revolver brian uhlmer okay right right not right now but as we grow the company it sounds great thanks guys i will turn it over thomas monroe patterson thanks brian operator our next question comes from the line of waqar syed with goldman sachs please proceed with your questions waqar syed thank you gentlemen in the cnr business how did the monthly revenues change did you see continuous decline throughout the quarter or was march better than february thomas monroe patterson about the same it weren’t really much changed it was higher in january and it declined slightly in february and stayed the same in march waqar syed okay and then you mentioned the pa activity had picked up some is that just temporary kind of pickup or do you think that continues into second quarter and perhaps later as well thomas monroe patterson i think that some of these regulatory bodies are paying close attention to the temporarily abandoned well bores and they are forcing some of our customers to go ahead and make a decision are you going to put it back on production or you going to go ahead and plugin abandon it and they’re just holding their feet to the fire a little bit better than they have in the past so that’s  the regulatory push has been probably the drive on that plug and abandon work i will say back to your previous question on cnr remaining flat remember that as the quarter unfolded and the rig count continued to fall we saw an increase in our rental  fishing tool revenue and an increase in coil ph and a couple of other parts of that segment that offset the decreases in frack so don’t think that frack was steady throughout the quarter it was actually coming down and these other segments were off setting it alan krenek and correspondingly the margin in march because what of what roe just said were significantly better than what it was in january and february in cnr waqar syed the margin was better because of the makeshift or because you were able to right size the company thomas monroe patterson combination of both but the makeshift in services helped quite a bit waqar syed okay then in terms of cost cuts obviously you have been pretty aggressive in those as the cycles kind of turns and we have fire activity hopefully  meaningfully next year how much of this cost cuts are cyclical in nature and how much are kind of secular that you can capture over the longterm thomas monroe patterson i think that  we’re probably  it’s a small amount that’s going to be cyclical we have to reinstate some of the comp and seen comp type related items that has been stripped as conditions improve and we start to compete for employees we’ll have to make sure that our incentives is equal to what we see in the competitor space but a lot of the infrastructure realignment we have done and the costcutting measures we have put in place we think there is pretty sticky and should be there for a while alan krenek back compared to fourth quarter of ‘ to first quarter of ‘ on the ga front there has been reduction in headcount of about  people i would say that we are not going to have to go back and rehire the majority of those people we may have to hire a few more but we’ll be able to retain those savings from those headcount reductions thomas monroe patterson that’s just ga alan krenek that’s just ga thomas monroe patterson the field employees obviously have to rehire as we redeploy equipments waqar syed are there any layers of management in the field as well that we may have taken out that probably won’t return or is just the ga costs the ones that are going to be more secular nature thomas monroe patterson no i think there’s some infrastructure and overhead on how we manage our business that we stripped out that will be pretty sticky it will be awhile before we see those layers return so we would have to see a considerable improvement in rig count before we would ever be in a position to need those back so we feel like fixed cost are going to be remind very low and we are going to be able to any improvement utilization should flow through to the bottomline quickly waqar syed and you mentioned did i hear clearly that the well servicing utilization was up  basis points so how are from about  in march to maybe closer to  to  is that what you said thomas monroe patterson no what i said was it could go up that much i was asked to try to quantify what the work over inventory and maintenance inventory projects are like and what that could do to our utilization rate so if those projects are reactivated and that maintenance is performed we could see somewhere  to  basis points improvement utilization may be more we will have to see how that goes but it could have that kind of impact on our utilization rates if customers choose to do that work waqar syed so where does the utilization stand today in march it was  for wealth service rates thomas monroe patterson it’s  in march waqar syed and do you have an update on where we stand today thomas monroe patterson it ought to be improving for april is what we said on the call waqar syed okay and then just one final question for me you mentioned that you will stop giving monthly guidance on monthly operational data updates why is that thomas monroe patterson well i think the markets to job right now greatest volatile these updates swing every month and you know they are not always good reflection of how the quarter is going right now and i think they have lost importance at this point in their value you notice the rows that spent and so at some point in time we feel that it is relevant to start doing it again we will start doing it again waqar syed sounds good thank you sir thomas monroe patterson thanks operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of john daniel with simmons  company please proceed with your question john daniel hey guys thomas monroe patterson hey john alan krenek hey john john daniel given the rebound in oil prices from the lowest reached q at what point do you think you’re going to start going back to the customers having that discussion on release pricing just given the unsustainable nature and what point do you think you actually get some relief thomas monroe patterson well i have said this a couple of different times that historically we need to see expected utilization rates kind of in each segment reach in the mids before you can get some pricing traction i don’t think this is going to be a similar recovery this time around john i think that utilization rates probably about  start to want those discussions this time because we are going to have to get some great help to pay improve wages so we start working employees are there we start getting more hours and we start needing to make some more hires for relieved crews to attract that labor and keep the current labor we are going to have to pay a little more and do that we are going to have to have price improvement and i think that is another thing substantially happen with a little bit of frenzy over accrued equipment because the customers needed or wanted it is going to get chewed up pretty quick it is going to get obligated very quickly and that ought to also bring about some quick pricing relief i think that utilization  effective utilization rates in the s probably starts to engage those discussions overpricing improvement john daniel okay you mentioned also you had a good discussion on the sort of the equipment attrition let’s assume that a frack company as major component parts from the unit that’s benefit with the demand horsepower begins to accelerate and that same company to try go out and replace those component parts and deploy that unit notwithstanding there’s a difference in quality between that repaired unit and new one how long does that process the overall process take to get that unit ready to go thomas monroe patterson probably  days from the time you order the component  depending on what the component is most of them are readily available right now so i’m going to say  to  days you can get what you need and get it installed and have the unit ready for work now that timeframe will shrink quickly if everybody tries to go through the same door at the same time john daniel okay fair enough well you also mentioned in the prepared remarks that you guys are looking at strategic combination at this point your buyers for larger wheels are which rather pursue regional talking opportunities and then on that same point if you were to look at the larger transaction you need to go to the debt restructuring process in order to accomplish a bigger deal thomas monroe patterson so the answer to the first question as there is no bias we would look at anything that made good sense obviously we are short on currency our equity is our best currency right now to make a transaction happen so we are limited with dry powder but we would be interested in anything that makes like i say good financial sense second question the answer is yes either the targets debt and ours both will have to be restructured one of the other i mean most of the targets that are big have enough depth that are kind of toxic at this point so we would have to have some sort of restructuring to make most of those transactions work and make sense john daniel okay thank you for your time thomas monroe patterson thanks john operator our next question comes from the line of josh large with suntrust please proceed with your question josh large hi guys good morning did you just provide q segment guidance thomas monroe patterson no alan krenek no josh large okay so it sounded like working capital is going to be minimum benefited all this year how should we think of capex and capital leases going this year you said it is less than  million now alan krenek as far as capital releases we are going to enter into very few based on that capital spending plan that roe talked about so what that means is the capital lease balance is going to be declining at a pretty good rate throughout the year which means the lease payments that can see the cash flow statement are going to go down accordingly josh large i guess previous guidance at  million of the  would be capital leases is  million still convert good run rate for that this year even though the  is not the  alan krenek maybe more like  yeah yeah it will go down accordingly it would take a big pop in activity for that to change yeah josh large okay great then if you could going to little bit more detail on well service margin improvement quarter over quarter i know a lot of restructuring was involved servicing was  except the primary beneficiary thomas monroe patterson yes alan krenek yeah and right sizing wages wages were tricky and i’ve said this before it was hard to go down on wages in well servicing because there was so many entrants into that business in  and ‘ as those competitors have kind of fallen through the cracks and left the market we have been able to right size wages a little easier but as those competitors are going out they fight hard by trying to raise wages and keep the best people in an effort to keep utilization high and so they put an artificial lift on wages and the work doesn’t justify those wages or the amount of work that doesn’t justify those wages but the competitive nature of the space did and we had to be competitive so as that’s falling out and work has come down and lot of those competitors have left the space we have been able to right size those wages i think that is the biggest driver there we’ve also done some considerable cost cutting initiatives i don’t want to take away from that and some restructuring on overhead how we manage those businesses that’s all been contributing factors to that but i think the biggest driver has been right sizing the wages over the last quarter and that’s a process that is ongoing we are continuing to do that today josh large okay could you give us sense of i guess how much of the rightsizing has been done already i think you said it is continuing to say should we continue to think that is going to be a pretty decent benefit going forward alan krenek i hate to put a percentage on it and try to quantify for you because it is moving target it is going to move with activity so as demand changes you know we will see that change if demand goes up and we see a tick in well servicing go up those wages could actually flatten out and maybe even go up if it stays around josh large okay great that was all i had thank you for your time alan krenek thank you operator our next question comes from the line of dan pickering with tph asset management please proceed with your question dan pickering good morning guys thomas monroe patterson hi dan dan pickering so just looking at the timing of incremental cash coming onto the balance sheet i mean clearly i think you guys feel like you got good running room here i heard i think bryan throw out a  million cash burn through the remainder of the year do you think that’s a reasonable level should it be less should it be more kind of what sort of breathing room do you think you’ve got before the cash becomes squeeze alan krenek yeah a couple of things i don’t think it’s going to be  million for the next three quarters so i think it’s important to note that when you look at the progression through the quarter  the first quarter you know we had a total of  million negative ebitda for the quarter well about  of that was generated in the first two months so we saw significant progress in the month of march on the cost savings standpoint as well as improved margins so i would say that we look  last earnings call we said that once we figure in the additional interest payments from the term loan that the cash burn would be about  million and we think that we did and that’s assuming the basically a zero ebitda generation and so roughly  in capex and then capital lease payments coming down to about  million about  million in capex and  million in capital lease payments and then some add backs for some noncash items coming back in now as we generate some positive ebitda then that gets lowered and i think roe said that basically by the end of the year and our definition of cash flow break even we should be pretty close dan pickering basically i think what here you are saying alan is as you got a window well into ‘ if not to the end of ‘ assuming some moderate improvement in the business you lost  or  million of ebitda in march i think it’s what you’re implying and that’s improving with cost cutting et cetera and so we ought to be the point where the end of ‘ feels like an okay place to be alan krenek if we see those improvements that you mentioned dan pickering okay great i just kind of wanted to confirm the numbers thank you alan krenek thank you thomas monroe patterson thanks dan operator our next question comes from the line of walt chancellor with macquarie please proceed with your question walt chancellor hi good morning i think you mentioned to bryan the ability to expand the revolver and recovery scenario under your dentures i mean what’s the magnitude of that how much did that revolver role about thomas monroe patterson we expand the current our ability to half the current revolver as receivables go up without tripping any kind of negative covenant that’s number one and then if we even see further improvement in ar which will affect our tangible asset value which we only have a certain percentage of that we can put secured indebtedness under the bond and dentures as that goes up as ar goes up we’ll have room to expand the revolver should we choose to walt chancellor so i guess what proportion alan krenek that’s not a nearterm event walt chancellor do you have a sense of the proportion of those increased receivables that could be applied alan krenek no i think at this point that that’s a pretty tough question to answer so i don’t know how to answer that thomas monroe patterson it’s quantifying of that right now is probably not something need to be good we just need to see grow ar what we need to do walt chancellor all right fair enough and then alan did you mention the share count in the quarter alan krenek yeah it was  million walt chancellor and how is it going to progress through the balance of the year alan krenek i think it should stay about the same walt chancellor okay thank you alan krenek thank you operator mr patterson we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments thomas monroe patterson okay well thanks everybody for calling in we’ll talk to you next quarter operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude
