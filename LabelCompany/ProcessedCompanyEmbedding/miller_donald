a great story will grow your business don will break down a major hollywood film showing you the tools screenwriters use to captivate an audience and captivating an audience is exactly what your brand needs to do the emphasis here is on clarity if your brand can tell a better story than your competition you’ll win in the marketplace this part framework will provide a filter for all your brand

captivate an audience you’ll use these tools to explain your ideas products and services for the rest of your life telling a clear story will give you a distinct advantage am – session two how successful brands use story to stay on top successful brands are already using the storybrand framework whether they’re a small company a billiondollar brand or even a political candidate the storybrand framework is the key to standing out against the competition how did domino’s pizza mount their comeback why did mitt romney lose the election to barack obama it will all become clear and you’ll take furious notes about all the ways you can apply the framework to your brand pm – lunch grab lunch with a fellow participant and be inspired by the work they are doing and their passion for their business turns out you’re not alone in trying to grow your company these are relationships you will likely keep for years to come pm – session three knowing your customer with work groups most brands position themselves as the hero in the story but this never works your brand is the guide to the hero and we explain why every human being feels like they are the hero in the story and successful brands affirm this identity in their customers and provide guidance so the hero can win the day this paradigm shift alone will change the way you talk about your products and services forevermore pm – session four what does your customer really want with work groups every customer wants something as it relates to your brand but it’s not what you think businesses tend to sell solutions to external problems but did you know customers tend to buy solutions to internal problems in other words customers are trying to resolve a frustration they’re feeling and you are going to be the brand that helps them resolve it in this session we will show you what customers are really looking for and once you start selling to that you’ll start seeing an uptick in engagement and revenue pm – done for the day grab fellow participants for a night on the town and continue building your new community of likeminded professionals tuesday am – session five becoming the guide in a story and in successful brand strategies companies position themselves as the guide communication expert nancy duarte points out that leaders should position themselves as yoda to luke skywalker or haymitch to katniss to position your company as a guide you need to do  magical things we’ll explain what they are and how to do them in this session and when you execute this strategy you’ll be amazed at how you suddenly become the “brand” customers have been looking for am – session six offering a plan too many companies rush into the room and try to sell their products but remember buying a product is a journey and it can be a scary one depending on what you’re selling and how expensive it is when you offer  of the  kinds of plans we outline in this session your customers will have much more confidence that you understand them and can help them resolve their problems these plans have been working for successful companies for years and they will work for you too pm – lunch pm – session seven creating your brandscript during session seven we take all that you’ve learned discussed interacted with and brainstormed for the last  days and create a brandscript for your brand you will use this brandscript in your email blasts on your website in your advertising and even while talking to people at parties because your brand now has a clear story people will understand you and word will start to spread pm – session eight implementing your brandscript extended session in the final session we critique your current marketing material we actually put many of the workshop attendees’ websites on an enormous television screen and talk about what needs to change after all you’ve learned over the last few days you’ll even be able to critique them yourself what should your website say what shouldn’t it say where are you confusing customers do they understand what your brand offers does what you offer resolve their internal conflict can the whole pitch be digested in just a few seconds or are you rambling on in this session we will also show you how to write the perfect sales letter using the storybrand framework this sales letter alone may pay for the cost of the entire workshop pm – workshop concludes the storybrand workshop includes  hours of lectures plenty of time for interaction with donald miller and your peers dozens of examples from hollywood films and dozens more examples from web print and television advertising each participant will also receive their own workbook containing more than a hundred pages of examples and inspiration from brands using

donald millerin donald millers early years he was vaguely familiar with a distant god but when he came to know jesus christ he pursued the christian life with great zeal within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty burned out and once again far away from god in this intimate soulsearching account miller describes his remarkable journey back to a culturally relevant infinitely loving godfor anyone wondering if the christian faith is still relevant in a postmodern culturefor anyone thirsting for a genuine encounter with a god who is realfor anyone yearning for a renewed sense of passion in  lifeblue like jazz is a fresh and original perspective on life love and redemption author bio▼▲ donald miller has helped more than  businesses clarify their marketing messages so their companies grow hes the ceo of storybrand the cohost of the building a storybrand podcast and the author of several books including the bestsellers blue like jazz and a million miles in a thousand years he lives in nashville tennessee with his wife betsy and their dogs lucy and june carter     publishers weekly▼▲ miller prayer and the art of volkswagen maintenance is a young writer speaker and campus ministry leader an earnest evangelical who nearly lost his faith he went on a spiritual journey found some progressive politics and most importantly discovered jesus relevance for everyday life this book in its own elliptical way tells the tale of that journey but the narrative is episodic rather than linear millers style evocative rather than rational and his analysis personally revealing rather than profoundly insightful as such it offers a postmodern riff on the classic evangelical presentation of the gospel complete with a concluding call to commitment written as a series of short essays on vaguely theological topics faith grace belief confession church and disguised theological topics magic romance shifts money it is at times plodding or simplistic how to go to church and not get angry pray and go to the church god shows you and sometimes falls into merely selfindulgent musing but more often miller is enjoyably clever and his story is telling and beautiful even poignant the story of the reverse confession booth is worth the price of the book the title is meant to be evocative and the subtitlenonreligious thoughts about christian spiritualityindicates millers distrust of the institutional church and his desire to appeal to those experimenting with other flavors of spirituality july  copyright  reed business

hannah v i thought that the book blue like jazz by donald miller was a great explanation of what the christian faith looked like from a brand new set of eyes as he went through his own life struggles explaining each incident in raw detail it was clear that this faith isnt just another cult or forced living but a new life entirely i used to not like god because god didnt resolve but that was before any of this happened my favorite aspect of this book was the way miller was able to connect with me as the reader and it didnt feel as though it was just another book about someones life being turned around it felt real earnest and alive just like jazz music i would recommend this book to anyone that thinks that becoming a christian will ruin their way of living or that being a christian isnt worth leaving their old life this is a clear example of how life can only get better when god is with you was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate the bookreader st paul mn age  gender male  stars out of  december   the bookreader st paul mn age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  blue like jazz both informs and challenges its reader to identify flaws in their faith this is done through strait forward analysis of christian actions including both flaws and strengths donald miller eloquently describes christianity through many personal stories these stories help to logically inform the reader what it truly means to be a christian how there are fake believers and addresses stereotypes placed on christians i would highly recommend this book for anyone who is a skeptical believer or who wants advice with how to deal with situations that are extremely challenging to faith miller allows the reader to come up with his or her own opinion on the topic he proposes this is extremely powerful in that it forces the reader to think donald millers book blue like jazz demonstrates the sincerity that is necessary in faith through personal stories and should be read by anyone who is searching for inspiration was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate bethel university student age  gender male  stars out of  this product is engaging may   bethel university student age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  donald miller a young writer who earlier in his life was beginning to lose his faith he went on a journey that shaped his faith he discovered changing politics met inspiring people and most importantly found jesus miller tells of his struggles that many christians can relate to through his thoughtprovoking encounters and experiences he squeezes in humor to help communicate difficult matters and reduce tension though the writing is written brilliantly the topics that are touched upon are broad topics such as church faith grace has so many ways that can be described its difficult to explain it just through experiences miller tries to find himself in god through his understanding of these terms but hard to do so without bringing in some theological discussion miller often brings up his view on the church his views of church are very real and almost critical some christians feel misrepresented millers perspective on some of his topics still seems unclear its as if he still cant conclude what church really is the book does a great job on emphasizing how faith relates to jazz this is the first donald miller book i have read though there are some downfalls i love his boldness and his honest opinions on christianity was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as

public speaker based out of portland oregon who focuses on christian spirituality as an explanation for beauty meaning and the human struggle he is also the author of searching for god knows what and a million miles in a thousand years miller writes there is something beautiful about a billion stars held steady by a god who knows what he is doing they hang there the stars like notes on a page of music freeform verse silent mysteries swirling in the blue like jazz and as i lay there it occurred to me that god is up there somewhere of course i had always known he was but this time i felt it i realized it the way a person realizes they are hungry or thirsty the knowledge of god seeped out of my brain and into my heart i imagined him looking down on this earth half angry because his beloved mankind had cheated on him had committed adultery and yet hopelessly in love with her drunk with love for her blue like jazz is the coming of age story of the author as he struggles with his own ideas of religion and the new world he encounters away at reed college this isnt your parents inspirational christian reading book either this is a visceral piece full of honesty and truth blue like jazz is

being open and honest with people who are seeking and searching in their lives and encouraging others to do the same i came to greatly appreciate his honest open approach he shared so many of his own personal hangups such as his dating relationships one thing i will take away from this book is that in order for us to succeed at relationships we must be open and honest he encouraged me not to be afraid of the outcome and stop trying to predict reactions of others so carefully this book also spoke to me in how he was so encouraged by what a friend said to him bob goff it reminded me how much a good friend or acquaintance can help to encourage or to enlighten us about ourselves good or bad and the power we can have to speak truth and hope into each others lives i would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship dating or marriage it helps you to take stock of where things are at and the relationships you are in i was provided this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate simply emmy bacolod city philippines age  gender female  stars out of  book review scary close by donald miller april   simply emmy bacolod city philippines age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for scary close dropping the act and acquiring a taste for true intimacy  ebook since i read blue like jazz ive started to like millers writings hes straightforward honest nofuss writing appeals to me he explained faith in a way like no one ever could i think in fact the next time im asked why i believe what i believe by philosophical people who wants to start an argument with me i will give him the book and let it explain then he can tell me his thoughts after that while the concepts he wrote in his book are simple yet they are profound and are often the most difficult to do i would agree with him when he wrote that often we exchange quantity instead of quality when it comes to relationships although he is a man i can relate to his kind of personality he also wrote about how we may manipulate our relationships and know when to lovingly walk away from it don talks about the different phases of his relationships with self and with others which i am certain reflects about us too i dare say that the journey is not dons but ours too only if we are honest enough to admit what i especially liked in this book is how don stressed the importance of accountability being willing to listen to people who care about you and your other relationships be teachable seek out ways to change yourself for the better this book is not about finding the right woman to marry or about marriage at all scary close is about finding authenticity in relationships relationship to self relationship to others because it is only when you are honest to who you really are can you finally be honest with others this book will encourage you to be more authentic when you are true all the true people in your life will show up was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate booklover  stars out of  i enjoyed the journey with miller to be scary close and be more transparent march   booklover quality  value  meets expectations  donald miller is probably one of those names that most people have heard about he has written blue like jazz and a million miles in a thousand years the thing i appreciate the most about miller is his honesty even if it makes him less popular among people hes not afraid to wrestle out his thoughts with others including his readers scary close is a book that is a bit challenging to people like myself who are introverts sometimes it takes a lot to be around people and to open up and be honest i enjoyed going on the journey with miller as he found how to balance life with an extrovert and the own problems that come with being an introvert honestly i could relate easily to his desire to rent a cabin and be away from people for an extended time just to write i think all introverts can relate to the always occurring problem of being with people and opening up and risking yourself with those who enjoy and long for the spotlight vs being alone in a room to recharge miller holds nothing back in this book even sharing some stories from his therapy sessions he talks about his childhood experiences at school and other issues that i think most people would hesitate to tell their close friend let alone a random reader however thats what i appreciated most the honesty transparency and vulnerability it revealed to me how much i long to be those things with certain people but it comes at the risk of ignoring what others will think of you miller reminds his readers that life isnt supposed to be about more and impressing others theres more to life and happiness than that  i received this book free from thomas nelson publishers in exchange for my honest opinion of this book was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate bookwomanjoan oak harbor wa age  gender female  stars out of  one mans torturous journey to intimacy march   bookwomanjoan oak harbor wa age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  miller found out that being authentic was scary he shares his experience of finding out that he was hiding his true self behind a reactionary construct of humor he began to understand why he had created the act in the first place he also realized that he had found at a young age that he could get respect from writing but he began to wonder what it would be like if he dropped the act and began to trust being himself miller takes us through his journey to intimacy to a deep sense of meaning he shares the retreat he went to the counselor he saw the books he read the guys he talked to and the woman who helped him his then future wife betsy he shares his breakthroughs and the insights he gained he recognizes the paradox of relationships individuals must be independent and free in order to be with each other intimacy means we are independently together  he was able to identify manipulation and control you cant control somebody and have intimacy with them at the same time  sometimes miller had to learn lessons that seemed obvious to me for example im convinced honest is the soil intimacy grows in  he does mention that women seem to have an easier time of it than men so perhaps men will identify with the torturous route miller took to honesty and intimacy he owes a great deal to betsy as she was stability through his journey even when he acted like a jerk this book is not pushy christian miller does share his christian experience but is also not embarrassed to say he hadnt attended church for over five years his thoughts will probably resonate with the younger generation who question the value of community worship and fellowship people who are discovering who they are might appreciate this book especially men it is very experience oriented as opposed to instructional miller just shares his own experiences lots of his own experiences i think i know more about him than i ever wanted to men may need the type of encouraging experience found in this book women might find themselves repeatedly saying well i already knew that was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate michele morin warren maine age  gender female  stars out of  intimacy  february   michele morin warren maine age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  going into a job interview i used to worry about overselling myself at some point i decided that i would rather lose out on a job opportunity than to suffer the indignity six months down the road of wondering if my boss was wishing she could find that stellar employee she had thought she was hiring ive tried to have the same mindset with my family thinking that it would be better to have them actually know me than to have them be impressed with me although i wouldnt complain if both could be true the fact that i attend a small church webbed through and through with relationships also requires a high degree of congruency the person i am when im sitting in the library teaching the bible had better be the same person who stands in the parking lot and hollers at her and sometimes other peoples children this connection with other people and this vulnerability of being fully known was missing from donald millers life as one of the eleven people in the universe who has not read blue like jazz i approached scary close with tabula rasa even so i found the tale of his meandering quest for intimacy and the memoirlike account of his courtship with his wife to be refreshing and redemptive because ultimately hooray he gets it donald miller spent his early adult years building a career based on an image that worked well for him but he was brought up short when a wise counselor asked how else will we connect with people unless we let them know us it is profoundly lonely to realize that all your friends love an image that you have projected the scary question always lurks what if they knew the real me miller helps his readers to see that most of us hide our truest selves beneath an outer ring or a character that we learn to play in order to win or to deserve love and acceptance in his case humor and intelligence made him feel powerful and professionally successful but his dating life was a death spiral of codependency and resentment letting go of his need to be impressive and to control every atom in the universe was necessary in order for miller to become the other healthy person in his relationship with betsy to expedite the process he decided to hang out with better people and soon found that he also wanted his work style to evolve from selfinvolved introvert to collaborative teamplayer as miller interacted with his fiances family he realized the same principle bears out in family life transparency within the family is a predictor of emotional health and happiness in children to this end scary close offers help for recognizing and ending manipulative behavior overcoming fear of intimacy and avoiding the loss that comes from careful living two concepts from scary close flashed like comets across my relational sky  all relationships are teleological ie going somewhere living alive and moving and becoming something married for nearly twentyfive years i dont want to find one day that weve begun to coast downhill in our relationship just because we have taken it for granted and stopped working at it  no human relationship will ultimately satisfy my heart and even intimacy with god will not yield ultimate fulfillment on this planet to expect otherwise is to deny the reality of our present condition of groaning within ourselves eagerly waiting for the adoption the redemption of our body romans  in the meantime however until that soulhealing is complete it is wonderful to walk beside another fallen creature in understanding and acceptance and to see in our children the fruit of having let them become scary close this book was provided by nelson books through booklookbloggers in exchange for my unbiased

cite this page about about us privacy terms donald miller quotes american  author born august     loading one of the things i associate with god is a sunrise how many sunrises have you missed over the years and god created that donald miller god sunrise you i think understanding your life as a story is a really terrific way of kind of knowing where you are and knowing who you are donald miller life understanding story life is a story you and i are telling stories they may suck but we are telling stories and we tell stories about the things that we want so you go through your bank account and those are things you have told stories about donald miller life want life is a if you have a beautiful story it has to have conflict if you dont have conflict it cant be a good story donald miller beautiful good conflict one of the things i love about our source text as christians the bible is that it teaches us not to avoid conflict and it teaches us that before the fall of man in paradise there was conflict god wants conflict to be a part of your life donald miller life love god every human being is searching for a deep sense of meaning and yet were all chasing success weve confused one for the other donald miller success deep human meaning is something we experience more than we attain its like finding a nice easy current in a river that carries you through life donald miller life experience river i started storyline after id accomplished all my goals and still wasnt happy id become a new york times bestselling author which was my goal from high school and yet i was less happy after accomplishing my goals than i was before donald miller happy goals goal most of us are waiting were waiting for something interesting to happen and i think were going to wait forever if we dont do something more interesting with our lives donald miller waiting wait think theres no authoritarian structure at reed college but the education is conservative so what you have is a lot of students who are very authentically looking for truth donald miller education truth looking i think thats the true litmus test for someone who has become closer to jesus their heart is more loving accepting childlike less believing that they have all the answers and more believing in him donald miller heart think true christians might say that you cant live a more meaningful life without jesus well thats absolutely not true you can you can enjoy a sunrise whether you know jesus or not donald miller life sunrise enjoy i think in the grand epic jesus is the hero of our stories and our stories as they were are subplots in a grand epic and our job is not to be the hero of any story our job is to be a saint in a story that he is telling donald miller hero job story sunday morning church service is not an enormous priority spending time with other believers is donald miller morning time service it confuses me that christian living is not simpler the gospel the very good news is simple donald miller good simple christian the most important thing that happens within christian spirituality is when a person falls in love with jesus donald miller love christian important people are lonely they want company and your book can provide them company and a little bit of hope and theres nothing wrong with that donald miller hope book lonely im not a pastor ive never been on staff at a church donald miller church never pastor we dont naturally want to take responsibility for our lives we want to give the responsibility to someone else we blame them when our lives arent good donald miller good responsibility want i think its very hard for us for christians to understand that its okay to read a book for instance on how to manage your time theres nothing wrong with that donald miller time book think the reason i like writing a memoir is because it isnt preachy donald miller writing reason memoir i tend to write first drafts that are incredibly cognitive very rational very boring they come off as justification like this is my idea and heres all the reasons that its right it doesnt make for very compelling reading donald miller reading boring first i love writing books  i really do if i could just quit everything and work on a book every day i would love that most donald miller love work day i used to write when i was in the mood or felt inspired anymore i write whether i feel inspired or not its a discipline so thats definitely different its part of maturing as a person and as a professional donald miller discipline professional without a positive male role model in your life it is extremely difficult to become a man who benefits his family and benefits society donald miller life positive family share this page cite this page citation find on amazon
