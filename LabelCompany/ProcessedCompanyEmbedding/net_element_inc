observed monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pnuemonia pjp should be considered in the differential diagnosis manage noninfectious pneumonitis by dose interruption until symptoms resolve follow with a dose reduction and consider the use of corticosteroids discontinue afinitor if toxicity recurs at grade  or for grade  cases for patients who require use of corticosteroids prophylaxis for pjp may be considered the development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose infections afinitor has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial fungal viral or protozoal infections including those with opportunistic pathogens localized and systemic infections including pneumonia mycobacterial infections other bacterial infections invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis candidiasis or pjp and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis b virus have occurred some of these infections have been severe eg leading to sepsis respiratory failure or hepatic failure or fatal physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with

years of age careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended laboratory tests and monitoring elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported renal function including measurement of blood urea nitrogen urinary protein or serum creatinine should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter particularly in patients who have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported blood glucose and lipids should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter more frequent monitoring is recommended when afinitor is coadministered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia management with appropriate medical therapy is recommended when possible optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on afinitor reductions in hemoglobin lymphocytes neutrophils and platelets have been reported monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to treatment and periodically thereafter drugdrug interactions avoid coadministration with strong cypapgp inhibitors eg ketoconazole itraconazole clarithromycin atazanavir nefazodone saquinavir telithromycin ritonavir indinavir nelfinavir voriconazole use caution and reduce the afinitor dose to  mg daily if coadministration with a moderate cypapgp inhibitor is required eg amprenavir fosamprenavir aprepitant erythromycin fluconazole verapamil diltiazem avoid coadministration with strong cypapgp inducers eg phenytoin carbamazepine rifampin rifabutin rifapentine phenobarbital however if coadministration is required consider doubling the daily dose of afinitor using increments of  mg or less hepatic impairment exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment for patients with severe hepatic impairment childpugh class c afinitor may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit
