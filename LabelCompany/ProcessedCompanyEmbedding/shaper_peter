publishing company that i started  years ago and it has grown and grown and we are now i suppose one of the leading children’s book publishers in this country  i started my publishing career at oxford university where i started a so called ‘funny’ magazine my magazine wasn’t particularly funny but i kept going and it got funnier and funnier and eventually we turned it into private eye magazine   i left private eye after about  years because i was so called managing director and i had almost nothing to do and i ended up working for a large publishing group as a chairman’s assistant and after a couple of years of doing that my wife rang up and said ‘i’ve got some news you’re going to be a father’ and i marched into my bosses room which was just through the door and said ‘john can i stop being your assistant and can i have something to do with children’ and he said ‘okay peter you will find we own a publishing company called mcdonald which has an educational publishing department get yourself a job’ and i did  i got promoted and promoted and eventually i met my boss and he said ‘what are you going to do next’ and then i had a real moment of terror and said ‘well i really want to start my own company’ and he said to me quite incredibly ‘ask me for the money’ and i did and i made a business plan and it involved borrowing £ and i took it to a friend and said ‘how’s this for a business plan’ and he said ‘well it’s only got one mistake  add a nought’  so i did and asked for £  i got it and i started usborne publishing  i want my books to be as edible as those bottles of sweets one used to see in old fashioned post offices i remember so well from my childhood  i want my books to be something you want to put in your mouth so my hope now is that i manage to hand over my company to my two children and we’re working quite hard on that my kids are sort of early forties very very clever young people who i admire and am extremely proud of and if it were possible to hand over successfully the ownership and possibly the running of the company to my kids i would be a very happy corpse  i’d be looking down with great pleasure show footer search mishcon de reya search the
