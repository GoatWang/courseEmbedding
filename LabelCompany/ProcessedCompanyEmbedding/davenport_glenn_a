october   in chattanooga tennessee during the first years of the great depression entrepreneur rody davenport jr and partner j glenn sherrill theorized that even in a severe economic upheaval people would patronize a restaurant that was kept spotlessly clean where they could get a good meal with courteous service at the lowest possible price the restaurants first customer french jenkins ordered six krystals and a cup of coffee all for the price of ¢ thus proving their theory true davenport had visited white castle restaurants taking notes of successful features before setting forth on his own venture davenport and sherrill set up the first krystal at the corner of th and cherry streets in chattanooga the first krystal was a modular building constructed in chicago and shipped to chattanooga for final installation the oldest krystal still in operation is located on cherokee boulevard in chattanoogas northshore district krystal is the seventh or eightholdest hamburger chain in

when mrs mary mcgee davenport saw a lawn ornament in the shape of a crystal ball while gazing at the lawn ornament mrs davenport commented that since davenport and sherrill felt cleanliness was a cornerstone of the concept they should name the restaurant crystal for clean as a crystal  yet with a k to add a little twist krystals restaurants through the years often sported a crystal ball on the

in healthcare foodservice demanded a retail mindset morrison head led the charge glenn davenport’s  years at morrison  joined morrison’s restaurants inc ’ served as managing director of  saudi arabia morrison  named president of morrison’s healthcare division  named ceo of morrison healthcare a separate corporation  awarded ifma’s silver plate award healthcare  remained ceo when compass group acquired morrison healthcare  retires after  years morrison management specialists will achieve sales in excess of  billion this year according to glenn davenport president and chief executive officer of the atlantabased division of compass group americas division that sales volume translates to  billion in managed volume he adds—making now a perfect time to “go out with a winning season” in his words davenport will retire august st at the relatively young age of  timing—not to mention hard work—has been central to his year career at morrison and he has never lost sight of his downhome roots no matter how highpowered his business acumen and responsibilities have grown he joined morrison’s parent company morrison’s restaurants inc in  and has held a variety of management positions throughout the organization in  he served as managing director of saudi arabia morrison fast track davenport returned to the us with the title of us regional vice president in  he was later promoted to senior vice president of the hospitality group and then became president of the healthcare division in  he was named chief executive officer after morrison healthcare became a separate corporation in march  and remained in that position through the compass group acquisition of morrison in  at that time having won the ifma silver plate  award in healthcare—and having made a threeyear commitment to compass—davenport began to think seriously about what he’d like to do with the rest of his life hearing this leader of industry recalling his audacious entrance upon the morrison scene provides a sense of how he’s come so far and where he might chose to direct his efforts in the future taking aim “when i was  years old i was going to college married and had a child on the way—i was poor hungry and needed money” he recalls “there was a man at church who always wore a threepiece suit and drove a cadillac i asked around and learned that he was john hill and he worked for morrison cafeterias i couldn’t figure how he made a lot of money working in the cafeteria in town but i thought i’d ask him for a job and perhaps become as successful as he evidently was” warming to his story davenport continues “one night he pulled up in the church parking lot and i went over to him and said ‘mr hill you’ve known my family all my life i’m looking for a job’ he said ‘it involves long hours hard work and i don’t think you can do it’ during the week the more i thought about what he’d said the madder i got “the next weekend i waited for him in the parking lot and when he got out of his car i said ‘if you can do it i can do it’ mr hill laughed and said he was hoping i was going to say that and i should be at his office downtown in the first national bank building monday morning i was surprised his office wasn’t in the morrison cafeteria but i soon found out he was president of the institutional division of morrison and those were the folks i interviewed with” davenport began as a management trainee in a morrison healthcare division storeroom at a time when the company operated  cafeterias and about  institutional accounts “the institutional division was the ‘stepchild’ since morrison cafeteria management thought that running foodservice in hospitals was a piece of cake” he explains when morrison bought ruby tuesday—a chain of about  or  locations—in  the division slipped to third place in management’s estimation behind morrison cafeterias and ruby tuesday and the time seemed right for an infusion of new ideas in the healthcare division davenport named president of the morrison healthcare division in  was full of plans and two years later boldly took morrison healthcare public “we had about  million in sales and about  employees—this year we have about ” davenport says “we were a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange for about five years prior to our acquisition by compass in april  when we went public everything we did affected our stock price therefore we grew up faster and worked better” today the senior dining division serves about  accounts with approximately  million in gross annual revenues while morrison healthcare division has about  locations and about  million in gross annual sales retail mindset when davenport began with the company hospital foodservice was a costplus business—the facility passed along expenses to the government or to insurance companies with the advent of diagnostic related groups drgs came a price freeze that impacted the way davenport’s company needed to do business in order to continue to grow “capitated fixed prices meant the priorities of our clients changed” he explains “prior to drgs it was management fee but today  to  of accounts are profitandloss therefore we have to have a retail mindset today you have to know what your costs are and be able to read a pl statement “plus you must have a customer mindset” he continues “after all we get hired to reduce the clients’ cost and to improve patient satisfaction” changing of the guard when davenport retires this summer scott maclellan founder of foodbuy now a purchasing arm of compass group will take over the helm he will report to rick postiglione ceo of contract foodservices at compass brothers michael and kevin svagdis will become president of morrison healthcare and morrison senior dining respectively davenport meanwhile will continue to work on a talk radio show he helped launch in january “i still want freedom over my schedule—that was my main reason for retirement” he adds” todays top story  under something more from foodservice director ideas and innovation play up items that fit restricted diets we started advertising our chicken wings as halal wings with assorted sauces our inspiration was to inform customers of an option that was available but not widely known by changing our approach to our marketing efforts we were able to exponentially increase participation in the consumption of our halal menu items managing your business when catering goes wrong while catering a wedding for a previous employer years ago rahul shrivastav—now director of catering at university of michigan—found himself in a panic when an elevator malfunction put salad service on hold “the wedding was in a very old building and the elevator had issues” he says “we had  plated salads in the freight elevator when it got stuck the dinner needed to start—they were doing their toasts” in a panic shrivastav hustled up a plan b his team would station a chef outside the ballroom and he’d plate new salads right there luckily the elevator was fixed in ideas and innovation the industry that never sleeps aside from black friday shoppers there may be no crowd of people more eager to get to their bounty than wedding guests headed for the passed appetizers while they’re surely thrilled for the bride and groom that feeling comes second to the thrill of landing that first shrimp skewer—especially after a long
