current structure which includes three unaffiliated investment company complexes currently the separate accounts invest start printed page in unaffiliated investment companies and changes due to investment performance style drift or management practice issues require substantial systems filing and printing resources which slows the process to make changes if necessary assuming contract owner

and efficiently to protect contract owners interests if the investment strategy management team or performance of one or more of the subadvisers does not meet expectations the replaced funds as

portfolios of penn series the investment objective and policies of each replacement fund will be the same as or substantially similar to the investment objective and policies of the corresponding replaced fund another benefit of the substitutions is that relieving the separate accounts of the administrative burdens of interfacing with three unaffiliated investment company complexes is expected

accordance with section  of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the total value of amounts held under a contract for a contract owner in all subaccounts of the separate account the “account value” or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the subaccounts accordingly there will be no financial impact on any contract owner the substitutions will generally be effected by having each of the subaccounts that invests in the replaced funds redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the substitutions and purchase shares of the respective replacement funds at the net asset value calculated on the same date  alternatively a replaced fund may redeem the interest “inkind” for example if it determines that a cash redemption might adversely affect its shareholders in that case the substitutions will be effected by the subaccount contributing all the securities it receives from the replaced fund for an amount of replacement fund shares equal to the fair market value of the securities contributed all inkind redemptions from a replaced fund of which any of the section  applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december   inkind purchases of shares of a replacement fund will be conducted as described in section vi of the application  the section  applicants state that the substitutions will be described in a supplement to the prospectuses for the contracts “supplements” filed with the commission and mailed to contract owners the supplements will provide contract owners with notice of the substitutions and describe the reasons for engaging in the substitutions the supplements will also inform contract owners with assets allocated to a subaccount investing in the replaced funds that no additional amount may be invested in the replaced start printed page funds on or after the date of the substitutions in addition the supplements will inform affected contract owners that they will have the opportunity to reallocate account value once as described below prior to the substitutions from each subaccount investing in a replaced fund and for  days after the substitutions from each subaccount investing in a replacement fund to subaccounts investing in other mutual funds available under the respective contracts without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year and without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitations other than any applicable limitations in place to deter potentially harmful excessive trading or limitations on the number of transfers to or from the fixed accounts available with the variable annuity contracts to the extent a contract owner has account value allocated to more than one subaccount investing in a replaced fund the contract owner will be permitted one reallocation from each subaccount if a contract owner reallocates on the same day from all affected subaccounts to which the contract owner has account value allocated they will have exhausted the number of permitted reallocations  within five days after a substitution penn mutual and pia will send their affected contract owners written confirmation that a substitution has occurred the prospectuses for the contracts as revised by the supplements will reflect the substitutions each contract owner will be provided with a prospectus for the replacement funds before the substitutions  penn mutual and pia assert that they will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including all legal accounting and brokerage expenses relating to the substitutions no costs will be borne by contract owners affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the substitutions nor will their rights or the obligations of the section  applicants under the contracts be altered in any way the substitutions will not cause the fees and charges under the contracts currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions the substitutions will have no adverse tax consequences on contract owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to contract owners further the substitutions will in no way alter any of the life insurance or annuity benefits available to contract owners under the contracts  the section  applicants believe that their request satisfies the standards for relief pursuant to section c of the  act as set forth below because the affected contract owners will have  account value allocated to a subaccount invested in a replacement fund with an investment objective and policies that are the same or substantially similar to the investment objective and policies of the replaced fund and  replacement funds whose current total annual expenses are equal to or lower than those of the replaced funds for their  fiscal year in addition the section  applicants represent that with respect to contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions penn mutual and pia as applicable will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter during the two years following the date of the proposed substitutions the subaccounts investing in the applicable replacement fund such that the sum of the replacements funds net operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit value for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the corresponding replaced funds net operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year  applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves the substitution the commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  the section  applicants assert that the purposes terms and conditions of the substitutions are consistent with the principles and purposes of section c and do not entail any of the abuses that section c is designed to prevent the section  applicants have reserved the right to make such a substitution under the contracts and this reserved right is disclosed in each contracts prospectus  the section  applicants argue that substitutions have been common where the substituted fund has investment objectives and policies that are similar to those of the eliminated fund and current expenses that are similar to or lower than those of the eliminated fund the section  applicants note that in all cases the investment objectives and policies of the replacement funds are sufficiently similar to those of the corresponding replaced funds that affected contract owners will have reasonable continuity in investment expectations accordingly the section  applicants conclude that the replacement funds are appropriate investment vehicles for those affected contract owners who have account value allocated to the replaced funds  the section  applicants argue that because of the foregoing representations and conditions the substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was intended to guard against and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the  act  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principal from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the  act and  the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the  act  accordingly the section  applicants are seeking relief to the extent necessary from section a for the inkind purchases and sales of replacement fund shares  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement funds by the separate accounts start printed page including the consideration to be paid and received as described in this application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the separate accounts are consistent with the policies of penn mutual and pia and the individual replacement funds finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  to the extent that the separate accounts inkind purchases of replacement fund shares are deemed to involve principal transactions between entities which are affiliates of affiliates the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each replacement fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching in addition although not applicable the section  applicants represent that the inkind transactions will conform with all of the conditions enumerated in rule a except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash  the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners account value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any subaccount contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions  even though they may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular penn mutual and pia or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds moreover although the transactions may not be entirely for cash the section  applicants assert that each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each replacement fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its registration statement and as required by rule c under the  act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions  the section  applicants also argue that the sale of shares of replacement funds for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed inkind transactions is consistent with the investment policy and restrictions of the replacement funds because  the shares are sold at their net asset value and  the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash to assure that the second of these conditions is met the adviser or subadviser as applicable of a replacement fund will undertake to examine the portfolio securities being offered to each replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction  the section  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act as stated in the findings and declaration of policy in section  of the  act and do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent conclusion for the reasons set forth in the application the

charge a daily administration charge is made against the net asset value of the subaccounts that will not exceed an effective annual rate of  a daily mortality and expense risk charge is made against

makes a withdrawal and a purchase payment was made in any of the eight contract years prior to the date of the withdrawal a sales charge may be deducted subject to certain exceptions noted below amounts withdrawn are attributed in sequence to prior purchase payments starting with the first purchase payment the table below shows the contingent deferred sales charge that may be deducted from withdrawals the charge is made only against amounts equal to purchase payments made by the contract owner and is not made against any gains attributable to such purchase payments or against amounts attributable to any purchase payment credits made to the contracts by penn mutual number of contract years since purchase paymentscontingent deferred sales charge  of purchase payment and later the contract owner may make certain withdrawals at any time without any sales charge being imposed at the end of the first contract year and once in each contract year thereafter the contract owner may

systematic basis as provided in the contracts withdrawals of up to  may also be made for medical reasons and for disability reasons without incurring a sales charge as provided in the contracts and described in the prospectus a withdrawal that is not subject to a deferred sales charge is referred to as a “free withdrawal”  the contracts contain a “freelook” provision as required under state law under the freelook provision the purchaser may return the contract within a certain number of days after purchase and receive the value of the contract on the date it was returned plus any premium taxes deducted from the purchase payment or in some states the purchase payment that was made to penn mutual the freelook period generally is ten days but may be for a longer period under the laws of some states and under different factual circumstances  the contracts have a credit enhancement feature each time a purchaser makes a purchase payment under the contract penn mutual will credit an additional amount to the contract from its general account assets “purchase payment enhancement” purchase payment enhancements will be allocated to subaccounts of the variable account iii and to the fixed accounts in the same proportion as purchase payments are allocated under the contract penn mutual will determine the amount of the purchase payment enhancement by multiplying the purchase payment by the applicable payment percentage set forth in the table below total purchase payments less total withdrawals made under the contractpurchase payment enhancement percentageless than  to  to  in addition if the initial purchase payment made under the contract is  or more penn mutual will credit a purchase payment enhancement to the contract in an amount equal to  of the initial purchase payment if more than one purchase payment is made during the first year of the contract the contract may receive an additional purchase payment enhancement at the time of each additional purchase payment based upon a purchase payment enhancement percentage rate applicable to all purchase payments made during the year such additional purchase payment enhancement will be determined as follows when an additional purchase payment is made penn mutual will determine the difference between i the sum of all prior purchase payments made during the year times the purchase payment percentage applied to the current purchase payment and ii the total purchase payment enhancement previously credited to the contract during the year the difference if any will be credited to the contract as an additional purchase payment enhancement  the contract provides that if it is returned to penn mutual pursuant to the freelook provision the contract owner will not receive a purchase payment enhancement and will not receive any investment gain or be charged any expense that would have been attributable to such purchase payment enhancement  the contract also provides that if the contract owner makes a withdrawal from the contract within twelve months of the crediting of a purchase payment enhancement and if the withdrawal is subject to a deferred sales charge under the terms of the contract the purchase payment enhancement will be recaptured by penn mutual and will not be paid to the contract owner  applicants seek exemption pursuant to section c from sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent deemed necessary to permit penn mutual to issue the contracts and to permit penn mutual and penn insurance to issue future contracts that provide for the recapture of certain purchase payment enhancements when the contract owner makes a withdrawal from the contract that is subject to a deferred sales charge within one year of the date a purchase payment and the related purchase payment enhancement were credited to the contract applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act grant the exemptions requested below with respect to the contracts and any future contracts applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  subsection i of selection  of the act provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company start printed page and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of the subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless “such contract is a redeemable security”  section a of the act defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants submit that the recapture by penn mutual of a purchase payment enhancement when a withdrawal is made from the contract within one year of the crediting by penn mutual of a purchase payment enhancement would not deprive the owner of his or her proportionate share of the assets of variable account iii the contract prospectus informs contract owners that any purchase payment enhancement credited to the contract within one year of the date of a full or partial withdrawal from the contract that is subject to a deferred sales charge will be deducted from the value of the contract applicants state that the contract and the prospectus make clear that any purchase payment enhancement credited to the contract in connection with a purchase payment made by the contract owners is conditioned on the purchase payment remaining in the contract for a period of at least one year unless the purchase payment may be withdrawn without payment of a deferred sales charge applicants assert that the contract does not provide a vested right to a purchase payment enhancement when the owner makes a withdrawal within one year of the credit unless the withdrawal is a free withdrawal because the purchase payment enhancement is conditional and not vested applicants maintain that the recapture of the purchase payment enhancement is simply the retrieval by penn mutual of its own assets  applicants state that the contracts provide for the conditional crediting of purchase payment enhancements during a oneyear period to provide penn mutual with some measure of protection against purchasers making purchase payments with the intent of gaining a purchase payment enhancement and then withdrawing purchase payments within a relatively short period of time they state that the contract is designed as a longterm investment vehicle and that it is intended to provide the owner with the opportunity for long term growth of assets and with income and assets for retirement applicants state that the contracts are also intended to provide penn mutual the issuer with the opportunity to recover over the long term the cost it incurs in issuing and administering the contracts applicants maintain that the conditional crediting of purchase payment enhancements during a oneyear period following a purchase payment is consistent with and a necessary part of the design of the contracts further the exemptions requested are limited in important respects recapture of a purchase payment enhancement will be made only if a withdrawal is made within one year of the crediting of the purchase payment enhancements in addition there will be no recapture if the withdrawal is not subject to a deferred sales charge  applicants submit that under the terms of the contracts as described in the prospectus the purchaser will receive his or her proportional share of variable account iii in accordance with the purpose and intent of sections ia and a of the act  section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c under the act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security applicants submit that the recapture of the purchase payment enhancement is not contrary to section c and rule c  applicants state that the recapture of the purchase payment enhancement described in the application does not involve either of the harms that rule c was intended to address namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or their redemption or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices they state that these harms were the result of backward pricing or the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day applicants contend that the proposed recapture of the purchase payment enhancement poses no such threat of dilution they state that to effect a recapture of a purchase payment enhancement penn mutual will redeem interests in subaccounts of variable account iii at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value of variable account iii the amount recaptured will equal the amount of the purchase payment enhancement that penn mutual paid out of its general account assets applicants state that although an owner will be entitled to retain any investment gain resulting from the purchase payment enhancement the owner will retain the gain based on current net asset value applicants submit that no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the purchase payment enhancement  applicants assert that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the purchase payment enhancement they state that there is no possibility that the recapture of such purchase payment enhancements will lead to speculative trading in interests created under the contract  applicants submit that because neither of the harms that rule c was meant to address is found in the recapture of the purchase payment enhancement section c of the act and rule c thereunder should not be applied to the recapture of purchase payment enhancements described in the application  applicants represent that any future contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts they submit that an order granting exemptive relief to future contracts would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of applicants resources conclusion applicants request an order pursuant to section c of the act for exemptions from sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent deemed start printed page necessary to permit penn mutual to issue the contracts and to permit penn mutual and penn insurance to issue future contracts which allow them to recapture purchase payment enhancements as described herein for the reasons stated in this application applicants submit that the requested exemptions meet the standards set out in section c namely that the exemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act start signature for the

would permit icmi as the investment adviser for the existing series of penn series to replace any subadviser or to employ a new subadviser without submitting such actions for the approval of

the manner contemplated by the manager of managers order is approved following the substitutions by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of that fund within the meaning of the  act  the purpose of the substitutions is to provide contractholders with improved investment options through enhanced investment performance and reduced expense ratios of investment options available under the

of the investment options offered through variable products as the investment manager of each of the new funds icmi will be in a position to oversee the operations of the new funds including the

that the investment objectives of each new fund will be the same as or substantially similar to the investment objectives of the corresponding fund that the new fund will replace the investment strategies and policies of the penn series limited maturity bond fund and the penn series index  fund will be substantially the same or substantially similar to the investment strategies and policies of the neuberger berman limited maturity bond portfolio and the fidelity investments index  portfolio the investment strategies and policies of the penn series mid cap value fund and the penn series mid cap growth fund may differ from the investment strategies and policies of neuberger berman partners fund and the american century capital appreciation portfolio respectively however the investment strategies and policies of these new funds will be sufficiently similar to their corresponding replaced funds so that the affected contractholders may continue to seek to achieve their investment objectives in the substituted funds  in substitution no  icmi will serve as investment adviser and neuberger berman investment management inc “neuberger berman” will continue daytoday portfolio management as subadviser to the new fund in substitutions nos   and  the new fund will following the substitutions be advised by investment advisory organizations different from the organizations that

will have on fees and expenses  following the date on which the notice of the application is published in the federal register but before the effective date penn mutual will send to affected

substitutions b the right of each affected contractholder under the vul and va contracts to transfer contract values among the various subaccounts and c the fact that any such transfer that involves a transfer from any of the replaced funds will not be subject to any administrative charge and will not count as one of the “free transfers” to which affected contractholders may otherwise be entitled  within five days after the effective date affected contractholders will be sent written confirmation “confirmation notice” of the substitution transactions the confirmation notice will a confirm that the substitutions were carried out b reiterate that each affected contractholder may make one transfer of all of the contract value or cash value under their variable products that is invested in any one of the subaccounts that were affected by the substitutions to any other subaccount available under their variable products without such transfer being subject to any administrative charge or being counted as one of the “free transfers” or one of the limited number of transfers to which affected contractholders may be entitled under their variable products and c state that penn mutual will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the variable products to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the effective date the confirmation notice will be accompanied by a thencurrent prospectus for the relevant variable product reflecting the inclusion of the new funds as well as an amended prospectus for the new funds  the inkind redemption proceeds will consist of the same securities that are currently held by the replaced funds redemptions inkind will be done in a manner consistent with the investment objectives policies and diversification requirements of the respective new funds further applicants represent that the inkind redemptions for each of the new funds will be reviewed by the subadviser responsible for making daytoday investment decisions for that portfolio to assure that the investment objective investment policies and diversification requirements set forth in the registration statement relating to the relevant new fund are satisfied in addition the inkind asset transfers will be valued in the manner that is consistent with the valuation procedures of both the replaced fund and the relevant new fund applications state that any inconsistencies in valuation procedures between the replaced fund and the relevant new fund will be reconciled so that the redeeming and purchasing values are the same in addition and consistent with rule a under the  act no brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the inkind transactions  the variable products expressly reserve to penn mutual the right subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of one openend investment company for shares of another openend investment company held by a separate account applicants legal analysis  section b of the  act provides that it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves such substitution section b further provides that the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is

substitutions and related transactions applicants assert that the purposes terms and conditions of the substitutions are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the  act applicants further assert that the substitutions will not result in the type of forced redemption that section b was designed to guard against  applicants maintain that the substitutions do

applicants will follow in the substitutions will give affected contractholders ample notice of the substitutions and any potential impact affected contractholders will have the opportunity to transfer their investments from one of the replaced funds in anticipation of the substitutions or from the new funds following the substitution in either case applicants represent that no administrative fee or transfer charge will be assessed in light of the fact that only four of the  investment options currently available to affected contractholders will be involved in the substitutions applicants believe
