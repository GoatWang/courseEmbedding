class readers test launch john greathouse handson startup advice for emerging entrepreneurs rss feed twitter quora linkedin facebook guerilla marketing brad feld style by john greathouse – july  posted in interview uncategorized this article originally appeared on forbes here serial entrepreneur venture investor and startup accelerator pioneer brad feld has notoriously mocked traditional marketing throughout his career rejecting the paintbynumbers approach to corporate communications deployed by most marketing executives brad has embraced unconventional guerilla marketing tactics to help establish his venture capital firm foundry group as a thought leader in earlystage tech investing “…companies should… focus on building amazing products if you have amazing products the marketing of those products is trivial if you have hitty products the marketing is impossible instead of focusing on marketing as an activity… integrate it into your products” brad feld managing director foundry group     if you havent already subscribed yet subscribe now for free weekly infochachkie articles according to brad “i would say my whole universe is probably categorized as guerilla marketing for a long time i had a line which was ‘whenever i hear the word marketing it makes me throw up a little bit in my mouth’” i recently spoke with brad about his approach to guerilla marketing and how he instills eclectic marketing tactics in foundry group’s portfolio companies you can watch my nine minute discussion with brad below or on youtube here httpyoutubegqjlnjxqno the catalyst for brad’s evolving view of marketing was this blog entry by chris moody in which he pointed out that much of foundry group’s thought leadership efforts are essentially a form of guerilla marketing chris is the ceo of gnip a foundry group portfolio company brad now considers thought leadership to be “a flavor of guerilla marketing it’s direct authentic nonpackaged creative around a particular set of ideas if you look at many of the companies we invest in sure they have traditional marketing activities but most of their growth and momentum comes from delighting their users i have shifted my mindset in terms of how companies should… focus on building amazing products if you have amazing products the marketing of those products is trivial if you have hitty products the marketing is impossible instead of focusing on marketing as an activity… integrate it into your products” when the entrepreneur is obsessed with the product and the company has organized all of its activities around that it’s very powerful” trada – guerilla marketing in action when i asked brad to describe one of his favorite guerilla marketing campaigns from within foundry group’s investment portfolio he cited trada brad proudly described how the company successfully used thought leadership marketing to seed a marketplace in which companies can outsource their seo campaigns to a legion of independent thirdparty “optimizers” the optimizers buy keywords and create ads on behalf of trada’s clients and then share the incremental revenue generated by such ads in particular brad was impressed that “trada…educated people on how sem works…and they were incredibly inclusive the founder niel robertson created something called crowdsortium and he reached out and invited anybody else who was working on crowdsourcing type businesses to be part of crowdsortium and that amplified the crowdsourcing phenomenon  within boulder they took part of their office and turned it into code space they basically said ‘anybody who is a developer come hang out here at trada and we’ll give you coffee and food and a desk and internet and you can plant here… and of course some of those people became optimizers think about things like code space as guerilla marketing because people are now talking about this great company trada which is providing space for developers which by the way they are desperate for” foundry group goes guerilla brad along with his partners have deployed guerilla marketing as a means of raising foundry group’s profile and communicating the firm’s casual and collaborative personality in addition to the partners’ tireless blogging they founded techstars one of north america’s premier startup accelerators one of the firm’s more infamous marketing stunts was their  music video entitled i’m a vc if you have ever dealt with pretentious investors you may pull a muscle laughing the video was produced as a means of marketing brad and jason’s book venture deals yet the wide coverage it received resulted in significant promotion of the firm its partners and the book “we get regularly asked… who’s our pr firm who does our marketing what kind of budget do we have for promotion we have never done a press release we write blogs we do music videos we show up we engage with people…we love our product we’re very focused on the users of our product which are entrepreneurs and… we translate into being very obsessed about our entrepreneurs’ products an image consultant would tell me ‘never do an interview right after you get out of the shower on skype because your hair is going to be flat… and you should have shaved this morning  that” write your own playbook successful guerilla marketing is predicated on executing unexpected and unusual tactics by not relying exclusively on conventional marketing tactics you no longer have to outspend your competition in order to garner attention and be perceived as a thought leader   “the marketing playbook from the pr firms is ‘be authentic’ come on just be you a company has a personality… make sure the personality fits the product but that personality is of the founders it can’t be manufactured and it shouldn’t be if you start to try and manufacture it it becomes laborious painful stiff and uninteresting you can be a multithousand person company and still have a personality the things that get so tiresome to watch… are   person startups who try so hard ‘we’re the market leader in blah’ well if you’re the market leader why doesn’t anyone know who you are if you have to tell me you’re the market leader are you really the market leader don’t tell me what you are just be it and show me” the next time someone at your company proposes a conventional marketing campaign do not reach for your antireflux medication instead follow brad’s lead and base your company’s marketing tactics on your company’s authentic personality john greathouse john greathouse is a partner at rincon venture partners a venture capital firm investing in early stage webbased businesses previously john cofounded revupnet a performancebased online marketing agency sold to coull during the prior twenty years he held senior executive positions with several successful startups spearheading transactions that generated more than  million of shareholder value including an ipo and a multihundredmilliondollar acquisition john is a cpa and holds an mba from the wharton school he is a member of the university of california at santa barbaras faculty where he teaches several entrepreneurial courses note all of my advice in this blog is that of a layman i am not a lawyer and i never played one on tv you should always assess the veracity of any thirdparty advice that might have farreaching implications be it

anderson really enjoyed this little piece off to look at the video and the foundry group john greathouse thanks jamie – brad is really entertaining  enlightening kelly schmandt just watched the foundry music vid good stuff brad hammers home some good points in your interview but especially the importance of a great product and the passion to engage customers that’s what is really all comes down to and a great reminder that all great things come from a solid foundation thanks john httptwittercomjohngreathouse john greathouse the video’s message is timeless i have been swarmed at entrepreneur events as an “investor” and its not a pretty sight product and passion are  of the equation – timing makes up most of the remaining  unless your space is really crowded you don’t usually need to scream to get people’s attention httpjournikposterouscom journik the number one rule of guerrilla marketing is  never fight your enemy when the enemy outnumbers you in marketing application this means that instead of marekting to millions of people attack small niche groups of fanbois otaku japanese term for “reclusive fanatic” and mania korean term for obsessive product zealots httptwittercomjohngreathouse john greathouse maybe another way of stating your point is “never fight your enemy where they outnumber you” startups will always be outnumbered but the key as you point out is to find niches where you can dominate and outnumber the big dumb company httpjournikposterouscom journik i love that find a niche where you outnumber them brilliant « « older post newer post »
