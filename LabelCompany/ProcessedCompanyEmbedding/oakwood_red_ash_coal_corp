labor rae ellen james associate solicitor michael j rutledge counsel for administrative litigation and legal advice washington dc for the director office of workers� compensation programs united states department of labor before dolder chief administrative appeals judge smith and hall administrative appeals judges per curiam claimant appeals without the assistance of counsel  and employer crossappeals the decision and order denying benefits bla of administrative law judge linda s chapman the administrative law judge rendered on a subsequent claim  filed pursuant to the black lung benefits act as amended  usc §§ supp the act after finding that employer was the properly designated responsible operator herein the administrative law judge credited claimant with  years of coal mine employment and adjudicated this claim filed on january   pursuant to  cfr parts  and  the administrative law judge found that the newly submitted evidence established a totally disabling respiratory impairment pursuant to  cfr §b thereby establishing a change in an applicable condition of entitlement pursuant to section  cfr §d reviewing the entire record however the administrative law judge found that the evidence was insufficient to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis pursuant to  cfr §a accordingly benefits were denied on appeal claimant generally challenges the administrative law judge�s weighing of the evidence and her denial of benefits employer responds urging affirmance of the denial of benefits and crossappeals contending that the administrative law judge erred in her designation of the responsible operator herein and erred in weighing the opinions of drs hippensteel and fino on the issue of the existence of pneumoconiosis  the director office of workers� compensation programs has filed a limited response asserting that substantial evidence exists to support employer�s designation as the properly designated responsible operator herein employer has filed a reply brief in support of its position in an appeal by a claimant proceeding without the assistance of counsel the board considers the issue raised to be whether the decision and order below is supported by substantial evidence hodges v bethenergy mines inc  blr   mcfall v jewell ridge coal co  blr   stark v director owcp  blr   we must affirm the administrative law judge�s decision and order if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by substantial evidence are rational and are consistent with applicable law   usc §b as incorporated by  usc §a o�keeffe v smith hichman  grylls associates inc  us   in order to establish entitlement to benefits under the act claimant must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment  usc §  cfr §§    where a miner files a claim for benefits more than one year after the final denial of a previous claim the subsequent claim must also be denied unless the administrative law judge finds that �one of the applicable conditions of entitlement    has changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final�  cfr §d white v new white coal co  blr    the �applicable conditions of entitlement� are �those conditions upon which the prior denial was based�  cfr §d claimant�s prior claim was dismissed because he failed to attend the hearing without good cause for his absence see  cfr §a  an order of dismissal has �the same effect as a decision and order disposing of the claim on its merits    �  cfr §a consequently the administrative law judge properly analyzed whether the newly submitted evidence established any element of entitlement decision and order at  see  cfr §§d a the administrative law judge found that the new evidence established total respiratory disability pursuant to section b thereby establishing a change in an applicable condition of entitlement pursuant to section  and these findings are affirmed as unchallenged on appeal see skrack v island creek coal co  blr    on march   amendments to the act affecting claims filed after january   that were pending on or after march   were enacted see pub l no  §  stat  codified at  usc §§c and l relevant to this claim the amendments reinstated section c of the act  usc §c which provides a rebuttable presumption that the miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis if fifteen or more years of underground coal mine employment or comparable surface mine employment and a totally disabling respiratory impairment see  cfr §b are established the administrative law judge concluded that claimant could not invoke the amended section c presumption because he failed to establish at least fifteen years of coal mine employment decision and order at  as there is no evidence and no allegation that claimant had fifteen years of coal mine employment  we affirm the administrative law judge�s finding that claimant did not invoke the amended section c presumption turning to the issue of the existence of pneumoconiosis at section a the administrative law judge considered three interpretations of two xrays taken on february   and july   and properly accorded greater weight to the interpretations rendered by physicians with the dual qualifications of b reader and boardcertified radiologist  see roberts v bethlehem mines corp  blr    sheckler v clinchfield coal co  blr    decision and order at  the administrative law judge determined that the february   xray did not establish the presence of pneumoconiosis as it was read as positive by dr forehand a b reader director�s exhibit  and as negative by dr wheeler a dually qualified physician see  cfr §a employer�s exhibit  decision and order at  the administrative law judge further found that the july   xray was interpreted as negative for pneumoconiosis without contradiction by dr fino a b reader employer�s exhibit  decision and order at  lastly the administrative law judge reviewed claimant�s hospitalization and treatment records for narrative xray reports and determined that there were no findings suggestive of pneumoconiosis decision and order at  director�s exhibits    claimant�s exhibit  after determining that all of the xrays in claimant�s earlier claim were interpreted as negative for pneumoconiosis and that the two new xrays and treatment record xrays were negative for pneumoconiosis the administrative law judge properly found that claimant failed to meet his burden of establishing the existence of clinical pneumoconiosis by xray evidence at section a see sterling smokeless coal co v akers  fd    blr   th cir  adkins v director owcp  fd   blr  th cir  decision and order at   as substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge�s findings pursuant to section a they are affirmed we also affirm the administrative law judge�s finding that claimant did not establish the existence of pneumoconiosis at section a  as the record contains no lung biopsy evidence and the presumptions at  cfr §§  and  are not applicable at section a the administrative law judge accurately summarized claimant�s hospitalization and treatment records the ct scan evidence the digital xray evidence and the newly submitted medical opinions of drs forehand fino and hippensteel relevant to the issue of pneumoconiosis  decision and order at  director�s exhibits      claimant�s exhibit  employer�s exhibits    while dr bailey included a few assessments of coal workers� pneumoconiosis in his most recent treatment notes the administrative law judge permissibly found that these notations were insufficient to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis as dr bailey failed to explain the basis for his diagnosis the xrays ordered by dr bailey did not include findings of pneumoconiosis and dr bailey did not indicate that claimant�s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd was related to coal dust exposure the administrative law judge properly concluded that the remaining hospitalization and treatment records do not establish the existence of pneumoconiosis as they did not include findings of pneumoconiosis or any pulmonary impairment related to coal dust exposure decision and order at  director�s exhibits    claimant�s exhibit  the administrative law judge also determined that dr hippensteel interpreted a digital xray dated july   as negative for pneumoconiosis director�s exhibit  and no doctor diagnosed pneumoconiosis on any of the ct scans of record decision and order at  director�s exhibits    claimant�s exhibit   the administrative law judge reviewed the three new medical opinions of record and determined that dr forehand examined claimant and diagnosed coal workers� pneumoconiosis based on a positive xray and an obstructive respiratory impairment due to cigarette smoking as well as coal mine dust and silica exposure based on claimant�s symptoms and occupational history of coal dust exposure a positive xray and a pulmonary function study director�s exhibit  drs fino and hippensteel both opined that claimant does not have coal workers� pneumoconiosis or any pulmonary or respiratory impairment attributable to coal dust exposure director�s exhibit  employer�s exhibits    the administrative law judge rationally discounted dr forehand�s diagnosis of clinical pneumoconiosis because it was based on the doctor�s positive interpretation of the february   xray which the administrative law judge determined was outweighed by the negative interpretation of a better qualified reader and because the administrative law judge found that the preponderance of the xray evidence was insufficient to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis see island creek coal co v compton  fd   blr  th cir  decision and order at  director�s exhibit  the administrative law judge also acted within her discretion in finding that dr forehand�s diagnosis of legal pneumoconiosis was unreasoned and entitled to diminished weight as he failed to explain how he was able to determine that coal dust exposure had a significant effect on claimant�s respiratory impairment even if the effects of breathing coal dust and smoking cigarettes are additive further dr forehand failed to explain his statement that claimant�s response to bronchodilators was due to the effects of cigarette smoke and coal mine dust exposure see milburn colliery co v hicks  fd   blr  th cir  clark v karstrobbins coal co  blr   en banc fields v island creek coal co  blr    director�s exhibit  decision and order at  as the administrative law judge found that the record in claimant�s earlier claim did not contain a reasoned diagnosis of pneumoconiosis and as substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge�s determination to discredit the newly submitted opinion of dr forehand the only physician to diagnose pneumoconiosis we affirm the administrative law judge�s finding that claimant has not met his burden to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence at section a claimant�s failure to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis pursuant to section a an essential element of entitlement precludes an award of benefits under  cfr part  see anderson  blr at  consequently we affirm the administrative law judge�s denial of benefits and need not address employer�s arguments on crossappeal accordingly the administrative law judge�s decision and order denying benefits is affirmed so ordered  nancy s dolder chief administrative appeals judge  roy p smith administrative appeals judge  betty jean hall administrative appeals judge endnotes  before the administrative law judge claimant was represented by m seth o�quinn a benefits counselor with stone mountain health services mr o�quinn has requested on behalf of claimant that the board review the claim in its entirety as he is not representing claimant on appeal claimant�s notice of appeal see shelton v claude v keen trucking co  blr  order  claimant�s initial claim filed on august   was dismissed by administrative law judge thomas burke after claimant or a representative failed to attend the formal hearing or respond to judge burke�s subsequent order to show cause why the claim should not be dismissed for failure to attend the hearing pursuant to  cfr §  employer concedes that its arguments on crossappeal need not be addressed if the board affirms the administrative law judge�s denial of benefits employer�s petition at   the board will apply the law of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit as the miner was last employed in the coal mining industry in virginia see shupe v director owcp  blr   en banc director�s exhibit   although  cfr § the regulation governing dismissals for cause was revised in  those revisions do not apply to claims that were filed before january   see  cfr §c because the former regulation remains applicable for purposes of discussing the dismissal of claimant�s  claim we have cited to the  version of the code of federal regulations  claimant alleged and the social security administration records reflect coal mine employment during the period between  and  consequently claimant cannot establish at least fifteen years of coal mine employment on this record director�s exhibits     a boardcertified radiologist is one who is certified as a radiologist or diagnostic roentgenologist by the american board of radiology inc or the american osteopathic association  cfr §aiic the terms �a reader� and �b reader� refer to physicians who have demonstrated designated levels of proficiency in classifying xrays according to the ilouc standards by successful completion of an examination established by the national institute of safety and health see  cfr §  a finding of either clinical pneumoconiosis or legal pneumoconiosis is sufficient to support a finding of pneumoconiosis pursuant to  cfr §a clinical pneumoconiosis is defined as �those diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconiosis ie the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment�  cfr §a legal pneumoconiosis is defined as �any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment this definition includes but is not limited to any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment�  cfr §a  the november   ct scan ordered by dr wolfe was read as showing the lung parenchyma and pleural surfaces as clear director�s exhibit  the march   ct scan was interpreted by dr coburn as normal id dr humphreys reported that the april   ct scan showed mild chronic nodular interstitial disease and old granulomatous disease cystic emphysematous changes and mild bronchiectasis id dr humphreys read the march   ct scan as showing �multiple areas of discrete consolidation throughout lung fields bilaterally with question of acute pneumonitis versus areas of parenchymal scarring� id dr mullins interpreted the february   ct scan as showing �no evidence of pulmonary embolus mediastinal lymphadenopathy of uncertain etiology and mild centrilobular and paraseptal
