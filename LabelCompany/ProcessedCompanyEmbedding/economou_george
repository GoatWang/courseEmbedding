pp download a sample pdf from this book here invaluable as they are these retrieved cavafy poems at moments seem a prologue to economous own so deeply has he assimilated in the course of decades of translation both the older poet and the store of greek classic poetry in which he also was invested but the very american wit and formal hijinks are economous own as are the grace for instance of an epithalamion that sappho might have sung—this isnt pastiche but a bringing of past into present as cavafy did and also of present into past this is the stance of irony which demands a double vision as its final gift this eloquent book treats us to a fractured narrative of the poets education in the irony that is and has been an essential armament of survival for those in both his benighted lands ––mark weiss   three cheers for continuations real or imagined for the various posthomerica even for the chimerical lollius and henrysons testament of cresseid economou’s steering of cavafys ta atelē to their unwritten télē ought to remind us that without wide sargasso sea jane eyre would still be a sad little nonstarter ––stavros deligiorgis    “george economou is one of those rare writers like the ancient ananios whom you wish you had invented even if he exists he can show how the world is finished in poetry as poetry is a way to unfinish words he can also set the angels straight by demonstrating that translation and poetry as halfsiblings are often more interbred than offspring of a common tongue cavafy should be pleased” ––yiorgos chouliaras  related books cp cavafy  complete

revolving stage of world literature the work of an ancient greek poet largely unknown and hitherto unread outside of a small circle of cognoscenti the poets extant poems and fragments as well as the record of their reception and preservation are presented in this oneofakind book of the sort that would have appealed to menippus of gadara and his followers a medley of verse and prose and a diversity of genres ranging from the epistolary novel to scholarly annotations and an index nominum ananios and his scholars and commentators perform their work at the edge of the real world and the margins of a thoroughly historicized and critically acute context ananios was born in  bc in the arcadian city of kleitor according to the third century ad author theonaeus who refers to a lost work by chamaemelon of patrae on the poets of achaia and arcadia in which the poets birth is said to have occurred during the nemean crown games following the th olympiad fortyone poems and fragments of his have survived along with twentyfive passages of verse attributed to him in quotations cited in various commentaries and literary works extending from the second century bc to the eleventh century ad the fragmentary nature of so much of his writing makes it impossible for us to speak with full confidence about the range of his subject matter though the ancient and byzantine attestations sparse
