attention but with high upfront fees and limited liquidity some say they’re not good for the client diana britton  jul   in the world of investing product departments are constantly putting new spins on old ideas confident there will always be investors looking for the next best thing that will provide outsized yield most of those new ideas are meant to make lots of money for the people who sell them less often they make money for the investors who buy them  in the wake of the implosion of many nontraded reits nontraded business development companies bdcs have emerged as a relatively new structure that is getting a lot of attention but with high upfront fees limited liquidity and sometimes a reliance on leverage to goose returns buyer beware “in my opinion brokers should not be selling private anything—private placement private reit private business development corporation—because it limits the flexibility it limits liquidity it limits transparency and it almost always means higher fees internal” said joshua brown vice president of investments at fusion analytics investment partners “the only reason nontraded bdcs get sold is because it’s product and it’s sexy and it’s a way for a broker to get a higher fee for the same dollars that they would put into a public version” according to tony chereso president and ceo of factright the frontend loads on bdcs are fairly similar to nontraded reits which are high  typically around  to  percent on top of that bdcs also typically have an incentive structure of two and twenty charging two percent of assets in management fees and  of capital gains based on performance “the downside is it’s a huge hurdle just to get back to even” because of the upfront fees brown said “do you know how hard it is to generate  percent in this day and age with flat stock markets and treasuries yielding  percent” nontraded bdcs are pitched as highyield vehicles brown said so that’s their sex appeal but they also exist in the public markets so why would you look for one outside of that is the yield going to be that much better probably not” new players in the market whenever a lot of new players jump on a trend and new assets are gathered losses often follow and lately bdcs—the nontraded variety—are gaining a lot of new traction and interest from advisors and product developers   “if they find that the trend is moving towards a new structure other than the nontraded reits i think you might see a groundswell in that direction by some people that are just taking advantage of clients looking for more nontraditional alternative investments that are maybe not subject to the same volatility that the stock market has” said gordon dunne managing director at the financial services network an osj of lpl financial according to factright bdcs have registered approximately  billion in total equity offerings in the first quarter of this year alone bdcs raised  million up from  million raised in the first quarter  according to data by robert a stanger  company shrewsbury njbased investmentbanking firm as of april there were four nontraded bdcs available for investment and another six funds in registration franklin square was the first to launch a nontraded bdc in  but many players new to the space have launched funds recently including cnl securities which uses kohlberg kravis roberts  co as subadvisor icon investment which uses apollo investment management as subadvisor and american realty capital all three firms have a background in nontraded reits these new players are hoping to leverage off of the success of franklin square chereso said franklin square now has  billion in aum and three bdcs the first of which was closed in may “i worry about firms that are in the real estate business then all of a sudden they’re in the business of doing what franklin square does” dunne said “do you really understand credit do you have the wherewithal internally do you have a relationship with firms that have a long track record of making loans to private companies i just hope that the bdc concept doesn’t get confused” dunne’s firm invested  million in franklin square’s first bdc fs investment corporation just as small inexperienced managers entered the reit space over the last decade dunne fears the same thing could happen in the bdc space “there have been quite a few firms that have gravitated to this investment structure” said chereso “some of them have some direct experience” such as on the publicly traded side of bdcs but if a firm’s core competency is in another area such as energy or real estate and they don’t understand credit or credit underwriting “that causes some concerns” chereso said many of these firms launching bdcs have strong financial positions and resources but the question is whether they have the depth of talent and capability to manage these strategies effectively he said   “my biggest concern is there are lots of folks that are jumping into the space particularly the sponsors who don’t have a lot if any experience in corporate credit in writing bdcs” michael forman ceo of franklin square the structure of bdcs bdcs provide financing to small and midsized businesses in recent years they’ve sought to capitalize on the relative lack of debt capital in these markets as banks restricted lending to build their capital reserves stanger says bdcs use a structure similar to nontraded reits in that capital is raised in a continuous private offering but bdcs are regulated under the  act that governs mutual funds the big difference is that they’re valued quarterly while nontraded reits are required to publish their valuations no later than  months after the conclusion of the offering see chart below comparing other aspects of bdcs and reits “i think there’s a lot of concern and skepticism with respect to the reits and they look at us as being different” said forman “i think we’ve kind of forced the reits to have to change their business model a little bit” but they are private vehicles so they don’t have the daily liquidity that comes with the public markets “when you have the opacity and you’re away from the public market your filing requirements are different you don’t have to disclose as much financial metrics as you would if you were public it gives you the opportunity to fudge numbers prolong taking of losses prolong taking of marks in the portfolio brown said tags alt investments real estate  comment hide comments comment  more information about text formats text format commentsplain text commentsallowed html
