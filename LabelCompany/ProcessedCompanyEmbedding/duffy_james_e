recommend this itemhellcat fury by robert taylor b truk the small atoll in the south pacific was the major anchorage for the japanese fleet comprising a magnificent harbor and four heavily defended airfields it was thought impregnable by the us forces as they fought their way up through the pacific but on  february  a violent twoday aerial assault by carrierborne aircraft of task force  exploded the myth in just two days the us navy flyers sunk over  tons of japanese naval shipping and destroyed an estimated  enemy aircraft totally eliminating all effectiveness of the japanese base light as the us navy losses were only  aircraft failed to return the battle for truk was ferocious the ground installations ships and airfield batteries put up intense antiaircraft fire against the attacking american aircraft while zeros did their best to repel the onslaught the air above the atoll became a maelstrom of flak tracer flying lead and shrapnel while below huge explosions rocked the ground as ammo and fuel dumps were hit fires raged and the acrid smoke of battle pervaded the entire area in this important new painting his first featuring the ff hellcat robert taylor brings to life the scenario that was crucial to admiral spruances forceful drive through the central pacific the once feared japanese base at truk is being reduced to a statistic of war hellcats of vf hurtle across the

ivan berryman pcrecommended item  from all items shown below we highly recommend this itemdestination tokyo by anthony saunders the daylight raid on tokyo led by lt col james h doolittle on sunday  april  has rightfully entered the history books as one of the most daring and courageous operations of the second world war on that day in mid ocean doolittle had launched his b mitchell bomber from the heaving spraysoaked flight deck of an aircraft carrier a deck too short to land on and flown on to bomb tokyo he knew there would be no return to the uss hornet either for him or the  heavily laden bs behind him for this was a feat never before attempted and for every crew member the mission was a oneway ticket yet under the leadership of jimmy doolittle they all dared to survive the mission for the  bombers was to bomb industrial targets in tokyo and surrounding areas to slow production of strategic war material then fly on to land in the part of southwest china that was still in the hands of friendly nationalist forces all being well the mission would be so unexpected it would plant the first seeds of doubt into enemy minds it worked â the japanese were forced to quickly divert hundreds of aircraft men and equipment away from offensive operations to the defence of their homeland there was however another reason behind the doolittles raid â to lift the morale of an american public devastated by the attack on pearl harbor four months earlier and the success of the mission provided the boost that was needed if any had doubted americas resolve in the face of uncertainty the courage determination and heroism displayed by lt col doolittle and his band of aviators restored their determination although it might take years and the price would be high america and her allies understood that the fight could and would be won commissioned to commemorate the th anniversary of the doolittle tokyo raid the painting portrays the dramatic moment that lt col jimmy doolittle lifts his b off the pitching deck of the uss hornet having timed his launch to perfection he climbs steeply away ready to adjust his compass bearing for a direct line to tokyo on the sodden deck behind him the crews of the remaining  aircraft whose engines are warmed ready and turning will quickly follow their commanding officer into the murky sky our reason for recommending this item
