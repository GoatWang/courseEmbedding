paper to univest dba “vanguard leasing” a little birdie told me that vanguard leasing is really univest  a publicly held company nasdaquvsp buying dirty paper i might add if you refer to my earlier post you’ll see that frontier leasing is selling its paper to avoid the courts finding out their dirtly little secrets or perhaps because it’s fluff they’ve already made all their money off of you lessees so they can now sell you to another abusive company and make the trail that much more complex so as not to be liable in the courts  more likely they’re close friends and they’re all involved in yet a new type of ponzi scheme to fleece main street out of its life savings  the new company is now beating the new lessees into submission  if you want to know more about univest and you’re someone who has been so rudely introduced to them give the “president” a call  i hear he’s doing his customer harassment himself – probably out of the cafeteria or maybe a starbucks  according to their annual report below it’s mr william s aichele – chairman ceo president of univest  or perhaps it’s mr hugh connelly president of vanguard leasing in the press release below vanguard leasing inc changes name to univest capital inc june univest national bank and trust co nasdaq uvsp today announced its nationwide equipment financing company vanguard leasing inc has changed its name to univest capital inc formed by univest national bank and trust co in  the equipment finance subsidiary has integrated univest products into its portfolio of product offerings for businesses and government

new business venture which univest established in may will continue to help us enhance the nontraditional side of the bank specializing in leasing small ticket items such as commercial and industrial
