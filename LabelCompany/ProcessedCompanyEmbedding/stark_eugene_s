to highest big a crabapple this is only the second year and while it had a couple of blooms i am not allowing it to set fruit yet the thing that classifies an apple as a crabapple vs an apple is the size of the fruit crabapples are less than  inches in diameter and this one just makes the cut off as it is just about  in diameter so it is big enough to eat fresh or use in pies cobblers and so on it is supposed to be exceptionally tasty so stay tuned till next year when it might give measmall crop was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate may   c d purchased over  years ago was
