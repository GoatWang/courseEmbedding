in more detail below overview universe sp  selection value stocks proprietary model ranks stocks by value criteria selects top  stocks every six months and holds each portfolio of  stocks for one year maximum of twenty value stocks momentum stocks proprietary model ranks stocks by momentum criteria selects top  stocks every six months and holds each portfolio of  stocks for one year maximum of twenty momentum stocks weighting value  percent momentum  percent detailed process the portfolio is constructed by selecting a basket of  value and  momentum stocks twice per year at each selection interval the model ranks sp  stocks excluding utilities adrs and all stocks not passing a basic earnings test based on predetermined value criteria and selects the top  next the model ranks the same universe based on specific momentum criteria and again selects the top  the model then invests  percent of the capital into equally sized positions of the  value stocks and allocates the remaining  percent into equally sized positions of the  momentum stocks the positions are then held for one year six months later the process is repeated and the model selects another  value and  momentum stocks that are also held for one year creating a laddered portfolio of up to  stocks note that it is possible for a stock to appear in both the value and momentum portfolios during selection and it is also possible to select the same value or momentum stock during consecutive sixmonth selection intervals thus while as many as  unique stocks may appear in the portfolio  value  momentum twice per year at any given time the portfolio is often comprised of fewer equity listings as a result of these overlaps after a stock is held for one year it is sold if it is not again ranked among the top  value or

inductive macro mount lucas blog inductive macro the speed of change – buying puts and calls june    mtlucasmacro value investing can be counterintuitive at times  acting against our own intuitions is not an easy thing to do it’s uncomfortable  we form our thoughts and reasons based on what we see and experience in the present and extrapolating our present situation into what the future holds is something we all do  predicting the trajectory of longterm trends that have already begun is not rocket science but investing requires you to be right about the trend as well as the timing of that trend bill gates wrote the following a while ago ‘we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten don’t let yourself be lulled into inaction’ it comes to mind as i think about some of the stocks we hold some of the stocks that are doing really well and the difference between a great company and a great investment there is a lesson in the drivers of value investing and how it interacts with momentum and more broadly on real visceral fears that are out there manifesting themselves in the politics of both the left and the right one way to think of value vs growth investing is as extrapolations of the current set of worries out to the future everyone remembers the blockbuster video example killed off by netflix and see that story writ large across big chunks of the rest of the economy and stock market disrupted businesses are everywhere – just this week hertz announced a bad set of numbers sequential declines in revenues and a bigger than expected loss the stock got hit hard on the other side the new ride sharing services uber and lyft raising money at high valuations as people extrapolate to a future of selfdriving on demand cars and no place for old school hertz amazon making it tough for big box retail is another example tech robots and ai are coming for jobs and business as we know it many instances of these seem perfectly valid and it’s easy to paint the picture the likes of amazon netflix and tesla are amazing businesses that have changed the world and achieved incredible things the issue we have is that they seem priced for ever greater levels of growth into perpetuity and don’t seem to take into account what we think is one of the key reasons value investing works – the people running the businesses are scared as well and where they can they fight back some will be unable to but not all take general motors and tesla general motors trades around a  pe and pays a dividend north of  and the last couple of years has about bn in income the numbers are a bit different for ford but the picture about the same that income is an enormous amount of firepower the people running these businesses are not stupid and i’ll bet are more worried about electric vehicles and driverless cars than you or i the market focuses on tesla and the incredible way it’s broken into the car market its gigafactory and its solar roof product they are extrapolating a future whereby tesla hits the big time with its k model  and kills off ford and gm – at these prices that’s what is implied relating it to option buying by buying tesla investors are effectively buying calls on this amazing future – things need to get to this new world quicker and it needs to be more amazing than it seems now they may be right but boy are those calls expensive here with gm and ford we see value investing as akin to buying puts on the speed and scale of this societal change and think that the extrapolation has gone too far – and doesn’t take into account the firepower of the businesses if the transformation doesn’t happen takes longer or investors decide to pull financing from the tesla project and they sure will need a lot of funding to build out the scale the stock price is banking on maybe things looks different and old detroit transforms itself that bn pays for a huge amount of rd to fight back – indeed when you look at it the first few firms to get an electric vehicle to market at a mass market price point have already done so they chevy volt the electric ford focus the nissan leaf gm is hiring  engineers in silicon valley to expand cruise automation the selfdriving car unit it spent some m on last year ford is doing similar investing bn in a selfdriving car firm in pittsburgh  gm is into the battery game as well opening battery factory in shanghai one can make the same case with walmart and amazon – walmart has some bn in operating income and an ecommerce business growing at  a year at its root walmart isn’t too far from being an amazon warehouse with a door and a checkout – it has a brand name incredible logistics and supply chains – and won’t go down without a fight all of this isn’t to say that tesla and amazon aren’t incredible companies pushing the world forward – they certainly are what they also do though is to bring others up with them galvanizing competitors into action capitalism in all its glory we think the markets are extrapolating the future too far in both directions – the new kings tesla and amazon and their ilk to the high side and older world names to the low side back to the bill gates quote investors are focused on the first part over estimating the next two years at the expense of how things will look in ten years the people in detroit and bentonville are focused on the second part and not being lulled into inaction buying old detroit at valuations like this is hard it goes against the story of change what you are doing by buying is really selling a put on the speed and scale of the change we’ve seen a movie like this before at the turn of the century new world growth expectations were out of hand and the growth premium over that five year period was enormous the following five years were reversed as value investing outperformed strongly the chart below has some details on it that’s how value investing works in cycles and it works because it’s uncomfortable   to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail march  march    mtlucasmacro this ft piece by gavyn davies is getting some attention he makes the case that the upturn in growth we are currently seeing is likely not a secular shift from possible stagnation but a welcome cyclical burst he references san francisco fed president williams recent paper concluding that the equilibrium real interest rate r is likely to remain much lower than in the past briefly r is derived by reflecting on an ex post realized output gap relative to the feds policy stance if the fed sets policy rates at what they think ex ante are very accommodative real interest rates relative to the estimate of neutral rates at that time and yet over the forecast horizon growth doesn’t respond they conclude that they haven’t been as easy as they thought they then mark down what the neutral rate must have been and then judge their current policy stance in relation to the new neutral rate the effect of this is that in the feds mind policy rates at  could go from being thought of as very easy to not that easy if growth didn’t respond  even though the principal author of secular stagnation larry summers is clear that it is a hypothesis this is lost on the commentariat who treat it as a gospel fact that we are doomed to live out as japan for the medium to long term but is it true is it relevant for the future how much weight should one put on the whole premise to our eye it’s an exercise in false precision these are the issues as we see them continue reading → the man who knew better february  february    mtlucasmacro roger alcaly wrote the following review of the man who knew the life and times of alan greenspan for the february   issue of the new york review of books alan greenspan served as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the most powerful financial position in the world for eighteen and a half years from early august 8 through the end of january  the second longest­serving fed chairman his tenure largely coincided with a period sometimes called the “great moderation” when economic growth was relatively steady inflation low recessions short and mild and serious crises defused without debilitating downturns under greenspan’s leadership the fed had an important and well­publicized part in containing threats to the financial system and economy such as the stock market crash of 8 the junk bond collapse a few years later the asian crisis of  with the deep fall in the value of asian currencies russia’s default in 8 and the bursting of the tech­ stock bubble at the beginning of the new millennium although it may have received more credit than it was due the fed’s successes earned greenspan widespread adulation including the financial times anointing him “guardian angel of the financial markets” and time saying he was chairman of “the committee to save the world” but despite—or because of—his achievements greenspan and the economy were eventually brought down by his continued failure to contain financial bubbles sharp rises in market prices that were not reflected in underlying values that a sustained period of stability and success in imiting potential dangers would engender complacency and hubris among both policymakers and investors is hardly surprising even so greenspan’s overconfidence is deeply troubling for he like the economist hyman minsky was well aware of the dangers posed by financial bubbles that develop during periods of great stability sebastian mallaby’s new biography the man who knew ultimately aims to assess how seriously this one great failure undermines greenspan’s legacy continue reading → stability…or a coiled spring august  august    mtlucasmacro a while back i read a piece about political stability not being all it seems it made the case that looks can be deceiving and illustrated it something like this since  italy has had some  changes of prime minister saudi arabia has had  rulers in the same period north korea has had  by that metric italy appears pretty unstable while the other two look like oases of calm but which keeps you up at night for all the machiavellian twists and turns in italian politics the political process has a way to reset the compression of the spring to take out some of the tension every few years to stop it from popping as the italians turf out the incumbent and vote for a change north korea and saudi arabia on the other hand don’t have the mechanism and need more and more pressure to keep it in place the force underneath keeps on building though the eventual reaction getting bigger but that’s statistics for you – measured that way you get an answer on stability but it’s probably the wrong one continue reading → the bond black swan july    mtlucasmacro everyone knows that bonds are rich right thinking people and smart beta types have looked for ways to get fixed income type results without buying bonds at this point it feels like bond markets are driving asset prices the world over negative interest rates have perversely led to bonds being used for capital gains while equity markets are being used for income i’m pretty sure that wasn’t in the textbooks versions of these flows can be seen everywhere where bonds go utility stocks consumer staples quality factors follow financials are the opposite of this flow driven by net interest margins and return on equity as bonds fall these stocks rally here is a little thought experiment let’s compare the results of buying a basket of momentum stocks single factor concentrated basket price momentum with the results of a basket tempered by volatility  factors momentum high is good and volatility low is good the difference between the two models shown below in blue compared with the yr yield in red source bloomberg momentum results derived from back test using mount lucas proprietary models hmmmmm… people love low volatility momentum stocks because they look like bonds but as minsky made clear over time the things people buy for stability can become a source of instability the seeds of the demise are being sown the price moves have brought forward a lot of future income nd quarter pce is going to be  annual rate things are looking up what if rates do go up the exit door will not be wide enough algorithm aversion on models and the donald june  august    mtlucasmacro whatever your politics one can’t help but be fascinated by the trump phenomenon one interesting aspect is how pollsters got trump wrong we can get insight into that mistake from nate silver at fivethirtyeight to his immense credit silver admits he got trump all wrong and went back to have a look at the why and the how… it boils down to a case of algorithmic aversion see here and here silver’s approach to forecasting which has been extremely successful across a wide range of subjects is based on aggregating data from multiple polls to build as big a sample as possible it is a mechanical quantitative model based statistical method the model spits out an answer and that is forecast but in the trump case he overrode the model he had a bias and in this instance he applied it to his forecast and voila a bad outcome even silver a devoted algorithmist if there ever was one fell into the trap he did not trust the model even though it had been right so many times before continue reading → bullard regime switching and trend following june  august    mtlucasmacro st louis fed president james bullard has released a paper detailing a revised approach to economic forecasting it’s a very smart way of looking at the world – read it here briefly he is saying that the current way of viewing the world as converging to a single state is no longer useful and instead should be thought of as a set of possible regimes the economy could visit with the regimes being generally persistent requiring different monetary policy responses and switches between regimes as not being forecastable in his submission to the fomcs quarterly economic projections he declines to provide a forecast for the ‘long run’ as it is outside his model projection range his low projection of the fed funds rate over the coming years reflects his view that the present regime has a low neutral real interest rate a switch to a higher regime is unforecastable if it were to happen it would cause a change to many variables – policy would not reflect a gradual shift to a single state but would have switched regimes this approach to forecasting was pioneered by james hamilton the math is pretty complex lots of markov processes etc but here is a simple way to look at it suppose we have two possible states in the world the bull state and the bear state the variable that determines the state is unobservable and since you can’t see it you can’t forecast it suppose in the bear state that the daily returns to an asset like the stock market are selected from a normal return distribution with a negative mean conversely in the bull state the mean is positive if the state variable is pointing at bear the trend will be down if bull the trend will be up the trendiness of a market is determined by how likely we are to remain in the current state for example if the probability of jumping from one state to another is  trends are more likely to persist than if the probability were  what causes the state variable to jump is unknown as bullard describes continue reading → trend following in a low rate environment april    mtlucasmacro can trend following make money in a low rate environment and is it all bonds we often get asked whether trend following strategies can make money in a low interest rate environment or in a similar vein if trend following is just a levered long bond position that’s now run its course in short we think that higher rates can help some aspects of trend following strategies but certainly should not be a driver of a long term allocation decision the portfolio benefit of an allocation to trend following to an investor or plan with more traditional equity and credit market exposures is not solely – or even largely – driven by the fixed income exposure using a simple trend following model in commercial markets commodity fixed income and currency – we explain here why we think that’s the right approach below we break down the sources of returns in times of crisis and suggest an economic rationale as to why it isn’t just about bonds continue reading → a macro classic march    mtlucasmacro macro trades come in two flavors modern and classic modern trades are short term liquidity driven mean reverting market dislocations you stare at the screen pounce make or lose your money and exit symmetric risk big premium for risk management and timing classic trades are long term cyclical shifts in the investment landscape classic trades take advantage of the myopic nature markets – extrapolating the present classic trades have the potential to make big money because the risks are asymmetric and the herd is against you we think

little future inflation am i able to predict what will drive future inflation…no like the card counter in blackjack however the deck sure looks rich certain funds that mount lucas manages may or may

the fed think local act global february  february    mtlucasmacro is the fed the world’s central bank or a domestic institution as we see it this is the key question for the fed at its next meeting the economic data since the last meeting looked at in isolation should lead them to continue hiking the fed funds rate – simply put the unemployment rate now stands at  and inflation has made further
