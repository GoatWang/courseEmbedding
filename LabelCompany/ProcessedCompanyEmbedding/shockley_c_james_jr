that included john bardeen and walter brattain the three scientists were jointly awarded the  nobel prize in physics for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockleys attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the s and s led to californias silicon valley becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation in his later life shockley was a professor of

three his father william hillman shockley was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages his mother mary née bradford grew up in the american west graduated from stanford university and became the first female us deputy mining surveyor shockley received his bachelor of science degree from caltech in  shockley received his phd degree from mit in  the title of his doctoral thesis was electronic bands in sodium chloride his thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor john c slater after receiving his doctorate shockley joined a research group headed by clinton davisson at bell labs in new jersey the next few years were productive ones for shockley he published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in physical review in  he got his first patent electron discharge device on electron multipliers careeredit when world war ii broke out shockley became involved in radar research at bell labs in manhattan new york city in may  he took leave from bell labs to become a research director at columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations group this involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns and so on this project required frequent trips to the pentagon and washington where shockley met many highranking officers and government officials in  he organized a training program for b bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights in late  he took a threemonth tour to bases around the world to assess the results for this project secretary of war robert porter patterson awarded shockley the medal for merit on october   in july  the war department asked shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the japanese mainland shockley concluded if the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to japans has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle then it means that the japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the germans in other words we shall probably have to kill at least  to  million japanese this might cost us between  and  million casualties including  to  killed this report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki to force japan to surrender without an invasion shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers he was an atheist development of the transistoredit shortly after the end of the war in  bell labs formed a solid state physics group led by shockley and chemist stanley morgan which included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore and several technicians their assignment was to seek a solidstate alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers its first attempts were based on shockleys ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity these experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials the group was at a standstill until bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor the group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work the rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged by the winter of  they had enough results that bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to physical review brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductors surface this led to several more papers one of them coauthored with shockley which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments the pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when pearson acting on a suggestion by shockley put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate a viscous chemical that did not evaporate commonly used in electrolytic capacitors and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail using a hammer placed across a pn junction john bardeen william shockley and walter brattain at bell labs  bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in  by julius lilienfeld who filed his mesfetlike patent in canada on october   although the patent appeared breakable it could not work the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered the electrolytebased transistors with bardeen gibney and brattain as the inventors shockleys name was not on any of these patent applications this angered shockley who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea he even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name and told bardeen and brattain of his intentions shockley angered by not being included on the patent applications secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable the point contact transistor he believed would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection on february   another team member john n shive built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought shives invention sparked shockleys invention of the junction transistor a few months later he invented an entirely new considerably more robust type of transistor with a layer or sandwich structure this structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the s and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his hand was forced by shives  advance shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the sandwich transistor and a first proof of principle was obtained on april   meanwhile shockley worked on his magnum opus electrons and holes in semiconductors which was published as a page treatise in  the tome included shockleys critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals shockleys diode equation is also described this seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors this resulted in his invention of the junction transistor which was announced at a press conference on july   in  he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences nas he was fortyone years old this was rather young for such an election two years later he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious comstock prize for physics by the nas and was the recipient of many other awards and honors the ensuing publicity generated by the invention of the transistor often thrust shockley to the fore much to the chagrin of bardeen and brattain bell labs management however consistently presented all three inventors as a team though shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention he eventually infuriated and alienated bardeen and brattain and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left bell labs in  brattain refused to work with shockley further and was assigned to another group neither bardeen nor brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention shockley semiconductoredit main article shockley semiconductor laboratory in  shockley moved from new jersey to mountain view california to start shockley semiconductor laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in palo alto california the company a division of beckman instruments inc was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley his way could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid in one wellknown incident he claimed that a secretarys cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit when in reality the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on after he received the nobel prize in  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic erratic and hardtoplease management style in late  eight of shockleys researchers who would come to be known as the traitorous eight resigned after shockley decided not to continue research into siliconbased semiconductors they went on to form fairchild semiconductor a loss from which shockley semiconductor never recovered over the course of the next  years more than  new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to fairchild personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit while still a student shockley married iowan jean bailey at age  in august  in march  the couple had a baby girl alison shockley became an accomplished rock climber going often to the shawangunks in the hudson river valley where he pioneered a route across an overhang known to this day as shockleys ceiling shockley was popular as a speaker lecturer and an amateur magician he once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the american physical society he was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes political viewsedit see also flynn effect and history of the race and intelligence controversy late in his life shockley became intensely interested in questions of race human intelligence and eugenics he thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species and came to describe it as the most important work of his career even though expressing his views damaged his reputation shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization on a debate with afrocentrist frances welsing he responded to a question as to whether black people are intellectually inferior because of their racial heredity with the following statement my research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the american negros intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and thus not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment shockleys published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist cyril burt and were funded by the pioneer fund shockley also proposed that individuals with iqs below  be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization anthropologist roger pearson whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach has defended shockley in a selfpublished book coauthored with shockley university of wisconsin–milwaukee professor edgar g epps argued that william shockleys position lends itself to racist interpretations geneticsedit he donated sperm to the repository for germinal choice a sperm bank founded by robert klark graham in hopes of spreading humanitys best genes the bank called by the media the nobel prize sperm bank claimed to have three nobel prizewinning donors though shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank however shockleys controversial views brought the repository for germinal choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other nobel prize winners from donating sperm relations with the mediaedit in  he filed a libel suit against the atlanta constitution after a science writer roger witherspoon compared shockleys advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to nazi experiments on jews the suit took three years to go to trial shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages shockleys biographer joel shurkin a science writer on the staff of stanford university during those years sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory but shockleys reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail at one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them his habit of saving all his papers even laundry lists provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life a group of about thirty colleagues who have met on and off since  met at stanford in  to reminisce about their time with shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution its organizer saying shockley is the man who brought silicon to silicon valley later yearsedit when shockley was eased out of the directorship of shockley semiconductor he joined stanford university where in  he was appointed the alexander m poniatoff professor of engineering and applied science in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in  deathedit shockley died in  of prostate cancer at age  by the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family except his second wife the former emmy lanning – his children are reported to have learned of his death only through the print media shockley is interred at alta mesa memorial park in palo alto california honorsedit national medal of merit for his war work in  comstock prize in physics of the national academy of sciences in  first

william bradford shockley jr ˈʃɑːkli february   – august   was an american physicist and inventor shockley was the manager of a research group at bell labs that included john bardeen and walter brattain the three scientists were jointly awarded the  nobel prize in physics for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockleys attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the s and s led to californias silicon valley becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation in his later life shockley was a professor of electrical engineering at stanford

external links early life and educationedit shockley was born in london to american parents and raised in his familys hometown of palo alto california from age three his father william hillman shockley was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages his mother mary née bradford grew up in the american west graduated from stanford university and became the first female us deputy mining surveyor shockley received his bachelor of science degree from caltech in  shockley received his phd degree from mit in  the title of his doctoral thesis was electronic bands in sodium chloride his thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor john c slater after receiving his doctorate shockley joined a research group headed by clinton davisson at bell labs in new jersey the next few years were productive ones for shockley he published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in physical review in  he got his first patent electron discharge device on electron multipliers careeredit when world war ii broke out shockley became involved in radar research at bell labs in manhattan new york city in may  he took leave from bell labs to become a research director at columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations group this involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns and so on this project required frequent trips to the pentagon and washington where shockley met many highranking officers and government officials in  he organized a training program for b bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights in late  he took a threemonth tour to bases around the world to assess the results for this project secretary of war robert porter patterson awarded shockley the medal for merit on october   in july  the war department asked shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the japanese mainland shockley concluded if the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to japans has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle then it means that the japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the germans in other words we shall probably have to kill at least  to  million japanese this might cost us between  and  million casualties including  to  killed this report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki to force japan to surrender without an invasion shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers he was an atheist development of the transistoredit shortly after the end of the war in  bell labs formed a solid state physics group led by shockley and chemist stanley morgan which included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore and several technicians their assignment was to seek a solidstate alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers its first attempts were based on shockleys ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity these experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials the group was at a standstill until bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor the group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work the rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged by the winter of  they had enough results that bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to physical review brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductors surface this led to several more papers one of them coauthored with shockley which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments the pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when pearson acting on a suggestion by shockley put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate a viscous chemical that did not evaporate commonly used in electrolytic capacitors and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail using a hammer placed across a pn junction john bardeen william shockley and walter brattain at bell labs  bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in  by julius lilienfeld who filed his mesfetlike patent in canada on october   although the patent appeared breakable it could not work the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered the electrolytebased transistors with bardeen gibney and brattain as the inventors shockleys name was not on any of these patent applications this angered shockley who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea he even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name and told bardeen and brattain of his intentions shockley angered by not being included on the patent applications secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable the point contact transistor he believed would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection on february   another team member john n shive built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought shives invention sparked shockleys invention of the junction transistor a few months later he invented an entirely new considerably more robust type of transistor with a layer or sandwich structure this structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the s and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his hand was forced by shives  advance shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the sandwich transistor and a first proof of principle was obtained on april   meanwhile shockley worked on his magnum opus electrons and holes in semiconductors which was published as a page treatise in  the tome included shockleys critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals shockleys diode equation is also described this seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors this resulted in his invention of the junction transistor which was announced at a press conference on july   in  he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences nas he was fortyone years old this was rather young for such an election two years later he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious comstock prize for physics by the nas and was the recipient of many other awards and honors the ensuing publicity generated by the invention of the transistor often thrust shockley to the fore much to the chagrin of bardeen and brattain bell labs management however consistently presented all three inventors as a team though shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention he eventually infuriated and alienated bardeen and brattain and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left bell labs in  brattain refused to work with shockley further and was assigned to another group neither bardeen nor brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention shockley semiconductoredit main article shockley semiconductor laboratory in  shockley moved from new jersey to mountain view california to start shockley semiconductor laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in palo alto california the company a division of beckman instruments inc was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley his way could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid in one wellknown incident he claimed that a secretarys cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit when in reality the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on after he received the nobel prize in  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic erratic and hardtoplease management style in late  eight of shockleys researchers who would come to be known as the traitorous eight resigned after shockley decided not to continue research into siliconbased semiconductors they went on to form fairchild semiconductor a loss from which shockley semiconductor never recovered over the course of the next  years more than  new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to fairchild personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit while still a student shockley married iowan jean bailey at age  in august  in march  the couple had a baby girl alison shockley became an accomplished rock climber going often to the shawangunks in the hudson river valley where he pioneered a route across an overhang known to this day as shockleys ceiling shockley was popular as a speaker lecturer and an amateur magician he once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the american physical society he was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes political viewsedit see also flynn effect and history of the race and intelligence controversy late in his life shockley became intensely interested in questions of race human intelligence and eugenics he thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species and came to describe it as the most important work of his career even though expressing his views damaged his reputation shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization on a debate with afrocentrist frances welsing he responded to a question as to whether black people are intellectually inferior because of their racial heredity with the following statement my research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the american negros intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and thus not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment shockleys published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist cyril burt and were funded by the pioneer fund shockley also proposed that individuals with iqs below  be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization anthropologist roger pearson whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach has defended shockley in a selfpublished book coauthored with shockley university of wisconsin–milwaukee professor edgar g epps argued that william shockleys position lends itself to racist interpretations geneticsedit he donated sperm to the repository for germinal choice a sperm bank founded by robert klark graham in hopes of spreading humanitys best genes the bank called by the media the nobel prize sperm bank claimed to have three nobel prizewinning donors though shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank however shockleys controversial views brought the repository for germinal choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other nobel prize winners from donating sperm relations with the mediaedit in  he filed a libel suit against the atlanta constitution after a science writer roger witherspoon compared shockleys advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to nazi experiments on jews the suit took three years to go to trial shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages shockleys biographer joel shurkin a science writer on the staff of stanford university during those years sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory but shockleys reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail at one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them his habit of saving all his papers even laundry lists provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life a group of about thirty colleagues who have met on and off since  met at stanford in  to reminisce about their time with shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution its organizer saying shockley is the man who brought silicon to silicon valley later yearsedit when shockley was eased out of the directorship of shockley semiconductor he joined stanford university where in  he was appointed the alexander m poniatoff professor of engineering and applied science in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in  deathedit shockley died in  of prostate cancer at age  by the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family

william bradford shockley jr ˈʃɑːkli february   – august   was an american physicist and inventor shockley was the manager of a research group at bell labs that included john bardeen and walter brattain the three scientists were jointly awarded the  nobel prize in physics for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockleys attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the s and s led to californias silicon valley becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation in his later life shockley was a professor of electrical engineering at stanford

external links early life and educationedit shockley was born in london to american parents and raised in his familys hometown of palo alto california from age three his father william hillman shockley was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages his mother mary née bradford grew up in the american west graduated from stanford university and became the first female us deputy mining surveyor shockley received his bachelor of science degree from caltech in  shockley received his phd degree from mit in  the title of his doctoral thesis was electronic bands in sodium chloride his thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor john c slater after receiving his doctorate shockley joined a research group headed by clinton davisson at bell labs in new jersey the next few years were productive ones for shockley he published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in physical review in  he got his first patent electron discharge device on electron multipliers careeredit when world war ii broke out shockley became involved in radar research at bell labs in manhattan new york city in may  he took leave from bell labs to become a research director at columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations group this involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns and so on this project required frequent trips to the pentagon and washington where shockley met many highranking officers and government officials in  he organized a training program for b bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights in late  he took a threemonth tour to bases around the world to assess the results for this project secretary of war robert porter patterson awarded shockley the medal for merit on october   in july  the war department asked shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the japanese mainland shockley concluded if the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to japans has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle then it means that the japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the germans in other words we shall probably have to kill at least  to  million japanese this might cost us between  and  million casualties including  to  killed this report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki to force japan to surrender without an invasion shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers he was an atheist development of the transistoredit shortly after the end of the war in  bell labs formed a solid state physics group led by shockley and chemist stanley morgan which included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore and several technicians their assignment was to seek a solidstate alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers its first attempts were based on shockleys ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity these experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials the group was at a standstill until bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor the group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work the rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged by the winter of  they had enough results that bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to physical review brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductors surface this led to several more papers one of them coauthored with shockley which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments the pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when pearson acting on a suggestion by shockley put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate a viscous chemical that did not evaporate commonly used in electrolytic capacitors and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail using a hammer placed across a pn junction john bardeen william shockley and walter brattain at bell labs  bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in  by julius lilienfeld who filed his mesfetlike patent in canada on october   although the patent appeared breakable it could not work the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered the electrolytebased transistors with bardeen gibney and brattain as the inventors shockleys name was not on any of these patent applications this angered shockley who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea he even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name and told bardeen and brattain of his intentions shockley angered by not being included on the patent applications secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable the point contact transistor he believed would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection on february   another team member john n shive built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought shives invention sparked shockleys invention of the junction transistor a few months later he invented an entirely new considerably more robust type of transistor with a layer or sandwich structure this structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the s and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his hand was forced by shives  advance shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the sandwich transistor and a first proof of principle was obtained on april   meanwhile shockley worked on his magnum opus electrons and holes in semiconductors which was published as a page treatise in  the tome included shockleys critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals shockleys diode equation is also described this seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors this resulted in his invention of the junction transistor which was announced at a press conference on july   in  he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences nas he was fortyone years old this was rather young for such an election two years later he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious comstock prize for physics by the nas and was the recipient of many other awards and honors the ensuing publicity generated by the invention of the transistor often thrust shockley to the fore much to the chagrin of bardeen and brattain bell labs management however consistently presented all three inventors as a team though shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention he eventually infuriated and alienated bardeen and brattain and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left bell labs in  brattain refused to work with shockley further and was assigned to another group neither bardeen nor brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention shockley semiconductoredit main article shockley semiconductor laboratory in  shockley moved from new jersey to mountain view california to start shockley semiconductor laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in palo alto california the company a division of beckman instruments inc was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley his way could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid in one wellknown incident he claimed that a secretarys cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit when in reality the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on after he received the nobel prize in  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic erratic and hardtoplease management style in late  eight of shockleys researchers who would come to be known as the traitorous eight resigned after shockley decided not to continue research into siliconbased semiconductors they went on to form fairchild semiconductor a loss from which shockley semiconductor never recovered over the course of the next  years more than  new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to fairchild personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit while still a student shockley married iowan jean bailey at age  in august  in march  the couple had a baby girl alison shockley became an accomplished rock climber going often to the shawangunks in the hudson river valley where he pioneered a route across an overhang known to this day as shockleys ceiling shockley was popular as a speaker lecturer and an amateur magician he once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the american physical society he was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes political viewsedit see also flynn effect and history of the race and intelligence controversy late in his life shockley became intensely interested in questions of race human intelligence and eugenics he thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species and came to describe it as the most important work of his career even though expressing his views damaged his reputation shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization on a debate with afrocentrist frances welsing he responded to a question as to whether black people are intellectually inferior because of their racial heredity with the following statement my research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the american negros intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and thus not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment shockleys published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist cyril burt and were funded by the pioneer fund shockley also proposed that individuals with iqs below  be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization anthropologist roger pearson whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach has defended shockley in a selfpublished book coauthored with shockley university of wisconsin–milwaukee professor edgar g epps argued that william shockleys position lends itself to racist interpretations geneticsedit he donated sperm to the repository for germinal choice a sperm bank founded by robert klark graham in hopes of spreading humanitys best genes the bank called by the media the nobel prize sperm bank claimed to have three nobel prizewinning donors though shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank however shockleys controversial views brought the repository for germinal choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other nobel prize winners from donating sperm relations with the mediaedit in  he filed a libel suit against the atlanta constitution after a science writer roger witherspoon compared shockleys advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to nazi experiments on jews the suit took three years to go to trial shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages shockleys biographer joel shurkin a science writer on the staff of stanford university during those years sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory but shockleys reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail at one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them his habit of saving all his papers even laundry lists provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life a group of about thirty colleagues who have met on and off since  met at stanford in  to reminisce about their time with shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution its organizer saying shockley is the man who brought silicon to silicon valley later yearsedit when shockley was eased out of the directorship of shockley semiconductor he joined stanford university where in  he was appointed the alexander m poniatoff professor of engineering and applied science in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in  deathedit shockley died in  of prostate cancer at age  by the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family except his second wife the former emmy lanning – his children are reported to have learned of his death only through the print media shockley is interred at alta mesa memorial park in palo alto

william bradford shockley jr ˈʃɑːkli february   – august   was an american physicist and inventor shockley was the manager of a research group at bell labs that included john bardeen and walter brattain the three scientists were jointly awarded the  nobel prize in physics for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect shockleys attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the s and s led to californias silicon valley becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation in his later life shockley was a professor of electrical engineering at stanford

external links early life and educationedit shockley was born in london to american parents and raised in his familys hometown of palo alto california from age three his father william hillman shockley was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages his mother mary née bradford grew up in the american west graduated from stanford university and became the first female us deputy mining surveyor shockley received his bachelor of science degree from caltech in  shockley received his phd degree from mit in  the title of his doctoral thesis was electronic bands in sodium chloride his thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor john c slater after receiving his doctorate shockley joined a research group headed by clinton davisson at bell labs in new jersey the next few years were productive ones for shockley he published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in physical review in  he got his first patent electron discharge device on electron multipliers careeredit when world war ii broke out shockley became involved in radar research at bell labs in manhattan new york city in may  he took leave from bell labs to become a research director at columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations group this involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns and so on this project required frequent trips to the pentagon and washington where shockley met many highranking officers and government officials in  he organized a training program for b bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights in late  he took a threemonth tour to bases around the world to assess the results for this project secretary of war robert porter patterson awarded shockley the medal for merit on october   in july  the war department asked shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the japanese mainland shockley concluded if the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to japans has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle then it means that the japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the germans in other words we shall probably have to kill at least  to  million japanese this might cost us between  and  million casualties including  to  killed this report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki to force japan to surrender without an invasion shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers he was an atheist development of the transistoredit shortly after the end of the war in  bell labs formed a solid state physics group led by shockley and chemist stanley morgan which included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore and several technicians their assignment was to seek a solidstate alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers its first attempts were based on shockleys ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity these experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials the group was at a standstill until bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor the group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work the rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged by the winter of  they had enough results that bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to physical review brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductors surface this led to several more papers one of them coauthored with shockley which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments the pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when pearson acting on a suggestion by shockley put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate a viscous chemical that did not evaporate commonly used in electrolytic capacitors and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail using a hammer placed across a pn junction john bardeen william shockley and walter brattain at bell labs  bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in  by julius lilienfeld who filed his mesfetlike patent in canada on october   although the patent appeared breakable it could not work the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered the electrolytebased transistors with bardeen gibney and brattain as the inventors shockleys name was not on any of these patent applications this angered shockley who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea he even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name and told bardeen and brattain of his intentions shockley angered by not being included on the patent applications secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable the point contact transistor he believed would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection on february   another team member john n shive built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought shives invention sparked shockleys invention of the junction transistor a few months later he invented an entirely new considerably more robust type of transistor with a layer or sandwich structure this structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the s and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his hand was forced by shives  advance shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the sandwich transistor and a first proof of principle was obtained on april   meanwhile shockley worked on his magnum opus electrons and holes in semiconductors which was published as a page treatise in  the tome included shockleys critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals shockleys diode equation is also described this seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors this resulted in his invention of the junction transistor which was announced at a press conference on july   in  he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences nas he was fortyone years old this was rather young for such an election two years later he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious comstock prize for physics by the nas and was the recipient of many other awards and honors the ensuing publicity generated by the invention of the transistor often thrust shockley to the fore much to the chagrin of bardeen and brattain bell labs management however consistently presented all three inventors as a team though shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention he eventually infuriated and alienated bardeen and brattain and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left bell labs in  brattain refused to work with shockley further and was assigned to another group neither bardeen nor brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention shockley semiconductoredit main article shockley semiconductor laboratory in  shockley moved from new jersey to mountain view california to start shockley semiconductor laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in palo alto california the company a division of beckman instruments inc was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley his way could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid in one wellknown incident he claimed that a secretarys cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit when in reality the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on after he received the nobel prize in  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic erratic and hardtoplease management style in late  eight of shockleys researchers who would come to be known as the traitorous eight resigned after shockley decided not to continue research into siliconbased semiconductors they went on to form fairchild semiconductor a loss from which shockley semiconductor never recovered over the course of the next  years more than  new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to fairchild personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit while still a student shockley married iowan jean bailey at age  in august  in march  the couple had a baby girl alison shockley became an accomplished rock climber going often to the shawangunks in the hudson river valley where he pioneered a route across an overhang known to this day as shockleys ceiling shockley was popular as a speaker lecturer and an amateur magician he once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the american physical society he was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes political viewsedit see also flynn effect and history of the race and intelligence controversy late in his life shockley became intensely interested in questions of race human intelligence and eugenics he thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species and came to describe it as the most important work of his career even though expressing his views damaged his reputation shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization on a debate with afrocentrist frances welsing he responded to a question as to whether black people are intellectually inferior because of their racial heredity with the following statement my research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the american negros intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and thus not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment shockleys published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist cyril burt and were funded by the pioneer fund shockley also proposed that individuals with iqs below  be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization anthropologist roger pearson whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach has defended shockley in a selfpublished book coauthored with shockley university of wisconsin–milwaukee professor edgar g epps argued that william shockleys position lends itself to racist interpretations geneticsedit he donated sperm to the repository for germinal choice a sperm bank founded by robert klark graham in hopes of spreading humanitys best genes the bank called by the media the nobel prize sperm bank claimed to have three nobel prizewinning donors though shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank however shockleys controversial views brought the repository for germinal choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other nobel prize winners from donating sperm relations with the mediaedit in  he filed a libel suit against the atlanta constitution after a science writer roger witherspoon compared shockleys advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to nazi experiments on jews the suit took three years to go to trial shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages shockleys biographer joel shurkin a science writer on the staff of stanford university during those years sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory but shockleys reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail at one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them his habit of saving all his papers even laundry lists provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life a group of about thirty colleagues who have met on and off since  met at stanford in  to reminisce about their time with shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution its organizer saying shockley is the man who brought silicon to silicon valley later yearsedit when shockley was eased out of the directorship of shockley semiconductor he joined stanford university where in  he was appointed the alexander m poniatoff professor of engineering and applied science in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in  deathedit shockley died in  of prostate cancer at age  by the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family except his second wife the former emmy lanning – his children are reported to have learned of his death only through the print media shockley is interred at alta mesa memorial park in palo alto

shockley was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages his mother mary née bradford grew up in the american west graduated from stanford university and became the first female us deputy mining surveyor shockley received his bachelor of science degree from caltech in  shockley received his phd degree from mit in  the title of his doctoral thesis was electronic bands in sodium chloride his thesis topic was suggested by his thesis advisor john c slater after receiving his doctorate shockley joined a research group headed by clinton davisson at bell labs in new jersey the next few years were productive ones for shockley he published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in physical review in  he got his first patent electron discharge device on electron multipliers careeredit when world war ii broke out shockley became involved in radar research at bell labs in manhattan new york city in may  he took leave from bell labs to become a research director at columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations group this involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns and so on this project required frequent trips to the pentagon and washington where shockley met many highranking officers and government officials in  he organized a training program for b bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights in late  he took a threemonth tour to bases around the world to assess the results for this project secretary of war robert porter patterson awarded shockley the medal for merit on october   in july  the war department asked shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the japanese mainland shockley concluded if the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to japans has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle then it means that the japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the germans in other words we shall probably have to kill at least  to  million japanese this might cost us between  and  million casualties including  to  killed this report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki to force japan to surrender without an invasion shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers he was an atheist development of the transistoredit shortly after the end of the war in  bell labs formed a solid state physics group led by shockley and chemist stanley morgan which included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore and several technicians their assignment was to seek a solidstate alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers its first attempts were based on shockleys ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity these experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials the group was at a standstill until bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor the group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work the rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged by the winter of  they had enough results that bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to physical review brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductors surface this led to several more papers one of them coauthored with shockley which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments the pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when pearson acting on a suggestion by shockley put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate a viscous chemical that did not evaporate commonly used in electrolytic capacitors and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail using a hammer placed across a pn junction john bardeen william shockley and walter brattain at bell labs  bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in  by julius lilienfeld who filed his mesfetlike patent in canada on october   although the patent appeared breakable it could not work the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered the electrolytebased transistors with bardeen gibney and brattain as the inventors shockleys name was not on any of these patent applications this angered shockley who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea he even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name and told bardeen and brattain of his intentions shockley angered by not being included on the patent applications secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable the point contact transistor he believed would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection on february   another team member john n shive built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought shives invention sparked shockleys invention of the junction transistor a few months later he invented an entirely new considerably more robust type of transistor with a layer or sandwich structure this structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the s and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his hand was forced by shives  advance shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the sandwich transistor and a first proof of principle was obtained on april   meanwhile shockley worked on his magnum opus electrons and holes in semiconductors which was published as a page treatise in  the tome included shockleys critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals shockleys diode equation is also described this seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors this resulted in his invention of the junction transistor which was announced at a press conference on july   in  he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences nas he was fortyone years old this was rather young for such an election two years later he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious comstock prize for physics by the nas and was the recipient of many other awards and honors the ensuing publicity generated by the invention of the transistor often thrust shockley to the fore much to the chagrin of bardeen and brattain bell labs management however consistently presented all three inventors as a team though shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention he eventually infuriated and alienated bardeen and brattain and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left bell labs in  brattain refused to work with shockley further and was assigned to another group neither bardeen nor brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention shockley semiconductoredit main article shockley semiconductor laboratory in  shockley moved from new jersey to mountain view california to start shockley semiconductor laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in palo alto california the company a division of beckman instruments inc was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley his way could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid in one wellknown incident he claimed that a secretarys cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit when in reality the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on after he received the nobel prize in  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic erratic and hardtoplease management style in late  eight of shockleys researchers who would come to be known as the traitorous eight resigned after shockley decided not to continue research into siliconbased semiconductors they went on to form fairchild semiconductor a loss from which shockley semiconductor never recovered over the course of the next  years more than  new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to fairchild personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit while still a student shockley married iowan jean bailey at age  in august  in march  the couple had a baby girl alison shockley became an accomplished rock climber going often to the shawangunks in the hudson river valley where he pioneered a route across an overhang known to this day as shockleys ceiling shockley was popular as a speaker lecturer and an amateur magician he once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the american physical society he was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes political viewsedit see also flynn effect and history of the race and intelligence controversy late in his life shockley became intensely interested in questions of race human intelligence and eugenics he thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species and came to describe it as the most important work of his career even though expressing his views damaged his reputation shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization on a debate with afrocentrist frances welsing he responded to a question as to whether black people are intellectually inferior because of their racial heredity with the following statement my research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the american negros intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and thus not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment shockleys published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist cyril burt and were funded by the pioneer fund shockley also proposed that individuals with iqs below  be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization anthropologist roger pearson whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach has defended shockley in a selfpublished book coauthored with shockley university of wisconsin–milwaukee professor edgar g epps argued that william shockleys position lends itself to racist interpretations geneticsedit he donated sperm to the repository for germinal choice a sperm bank founded by robert klark graham in hopes of spreading humanitys best genes the bank called by the media the nobel prize sperm bank claimed to have three nobel prizewinning donors though shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank however shockleys controversial views brought the repository for germinal choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other nobel prize winners from donating sperm relations with the mediaedit in  he filed a libel suit against the atlanta constitution after a science writer roger witherspoon compared shockleys advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to nazi experiments on jews the suit took three years to go to trial shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages shockleys biographer joel shurkin a science writer on the staff of stanford university during those years sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory but shockleys reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail at one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them his habit of saving all his papers even laundry lists provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life a group of about thirty colleagues who have met on and off since  met at stanford in  to reminisce about their time with shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution its organizer saying shockley is the man who brought silicon to silicon valley later yearsedit when shockley was eased out of the directorship of shockley semiconductor he joined stanford university where in  he was appointed the alexander m poniatoff professor of engineering and applied science in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in  deathedit shockley died in  of prostate cancer at age  by the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family

labs in new jersey the next few years were productive ones for shockley he published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in physical review in  he got his first patent electron discharge device on electron multipliers careeredit when world war ii broke out shockley became involved in radar research at bell labs in manhattan new york city in may  he took leave from bell labs to become a research director at columbia universitys antisubmarine warfare operations group this involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques optimizing depth charge patterns and so on this project required frequent trips to the pentagon and washington where shockley met many highranking officers and government officials in  he organized a training program for b bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights in late  he took a threemonth tour to bases around the world to assess the results for this project secretary of war robert porter patterson awarded shockley the medal for merit on october   in july  the war department asked shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the japanese mainland shockley concluded if the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to japans has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle then it means that the japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the germans in other words we shall probably have to kill at least  to  million japanese this might cost us between  and  million casualties including  to  killed this report influenced the decision for the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki to force japan to surrender without an invasion shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers he was an atheist development of the transistoredit shortly after the end of the war in  bell labs formed a solid state physics group led by shockley and chemist stanley morgan which included john bardeen walter brattain physicist gerald pearson chemist robert gibney electronics expert hilbert moore and several technicians their assignment was to seek a solidstate alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers its first attempts were based on shockleys ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity these experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials the group was at a standstill until bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor the group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work the rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged by the winter of  they had enough results that bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to physical review brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductors surface this led to several more papers one of them coauthored with shockley which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments the pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when pearson acting on a suggestion by shockley put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate a viscous chemical that did not evaporate commonly used in electrolytic capacitors and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail using a hammer placed across a pn junction john bardeen william shockley and walter brattain at bell labs  bell labs attorneys soon discovered shockleys field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in  by julius lilienfeld who filed his mesfetlike patent in canada on october   although the patent appeared breakable it could not work the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the bardeenbrattain point contact design three others submitted first covered the electrolytebased transistors with bardeen gibney and brattain as the inventors shockleys name was not on any of these patent applications this angered shockley who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea he even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name and told bardeen and brattain of his intentions shockley angered by not being included on the patent applications secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable the point contact transistor he believed would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection on february   another team member john n shive built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought shives invention sparked shockleys invention of the junction transistor a few months later he invented an entirely new considerably more robust type of transistor with a layer or sandwich structure this structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the s and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were mixture of cooperation and competition he also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his hand was forced by shives  advance shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the sandwich transistor and a first proof of principle was obtained on april   meanwhile shockley worked on his magnum opus electrons and holes in semiconductors which was published as a page treatise in  the tome included shockleys critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals shockleys diode equation is also described this seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors this resulted in his invention of the junction transistor which was announced at a press conference on july   in  he was elected a member of the national academy of sciences nas he was fortyone years old this was rather young for such an election two years later he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious comstock prize for physics by the nas and was the recipient of many other awards and honors the ensuing publicity generated by the invention of the transistor often thrust shockley to the fore much to the chagrin of bardeen and brattain bell labs management however consistently presented all three inventors as a team though shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention he eventually infuriated and alienated bardeen and brattain and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left bell labs in  brattain refused to work with shockley further and was assigned to another group neither bardeen nor brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention shockley semiconductoredit main article shockley semiconductor laboratory in  shockley moved from new jersey to mountain view california to start shockley semiconductor laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in palo alto california the company a division of beckman instruments inc was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as silicon valley his way could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid in one wellknown incident he claimed that a secretarys cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit when in reality the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on after he received the nobel prize in  his demeanor changed as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic erratic and hardtoplease management style in late  eight of shockleys researchers who would come to be known as the traitorous eight resigned after shockley decided not to continue research into siliconbased semiconductors they went on to form fairchild semiconductor a loss from which shockley semiconductor never recovered over the course of the next  years more than  new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to fairchild personal lifeedit marriage and childrenedit while still a student shockley married iowan jean bailey at age  in august  in march  the couple had a baby girl alison shockley became an accomplished rock climber going often to the shawangunks in the hudson river valley where he pioneered a route across an overhang known to this day as shockleys ceiling shockley was popular as a speaker lecturer and an amateur magician he once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the american physical society he was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes political viewsedit see also flynn effect and history of the race and intelligence controversy late in his life shockley became intensely interested in questions of race human intelligence and eugenics he thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species and came to describe it as the most important work of his career even though expressing his views damaged his reputation shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization on a debate with afrocentrist frances welsing he responded to a question as to whether black people are intellectually inferior because of their racial heredity with the following statement my research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the american negros intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and thus not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment shockleys published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist cyril burt and were funded by the pioneer fund shockley also proposed that individuals with iqs below  be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization anthropologist roger pearson whose writings are based on an evolutionary and racialist approach has defended shockley in a selfpublished book coauthored with shockley university of wisconsin–milwaukee professor edgar g epps argued that william shockleys position lends itself to racist interpretations geneticsedit he donated sperm to the repository for germinal choice a sperm bank founded by robert klark graham in hopes of spreading humanitys best genes the bank called by the media the nobel prize sperm bank claimed to have three nobel prizewinning donors though shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank however shockleys controversial views brought the repository for germinal choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other nobel prize winners from donating sperm relations with the mediaedit in  he filed a libel suit against the atlanta constitution after a science writer roger witherspoon compared shockleys advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to nazi experiments on jews the suit took three years to go to trial shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in actual damages and no punitive damages shockleys biographer joel shurkin a science writer on the staff of stanford university during those years sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory but shockleys reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict shockley taped his telephone conversations with reporters and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail at one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them his habit of saving all his papers even laundry lists provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life a group of about thirty colleagues who have met on and off since  met at stanford in  to reminisce about their time with shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution its organizer saying shockley is the man who brought silicon to silicon valley later yearsedit when shockley was eased out of the directorship of shockley semiconductor he joined stanford university where in  he was appointed the alexander m poniatoff professor of engineering and applied science in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in  deathedit shockley died in  of prostate cancer at age  by the time of his death he was almost completely estranged from most of his friends and family
