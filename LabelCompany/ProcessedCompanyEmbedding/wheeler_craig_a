nongaap operating expense please see the presentation accompanying this call for further information and reconciliation of this measure with that i will turn the call over to craig craig wheeler thank you sarah and welcome everybody i will begin today’s call with a discussion of the regulatory status of glatopa  milligram and our glatopa  milligram product results then i will cover our biosimilar and novel drug programs and scott will discuss our financial results for the quarter and then we will open the call for questions as most of you know pfizer sandoz’s contracted glatopa fillfinish manufacturer received an fda warning letter in february citing observations at mcpherson kansas facility where our glatopa products are manufactured while glatopa was not specifically cited in the observation that led to the warning letter the fda stated that it may withhold approval of pending drug applications at this time we believe the warning letter is the sole cause of the delay in the approval of sandoz’s anda for glatopa  milligram as we have no outstanding questions from the fda on the application in terms of the status of the resolution of the warning letter pfizer submitted their response to the fda we have reviewed the response and believe it is comprehensive and convincing demonstrating that pfizer has already done a significant amount of work to address the observations it’s important to point out that the observations and the warning letter relate to a may to june  inspection and the warning letter was not received until february of  pfizer’s response not only confirms that they have already completed most of the commitment made to the fda following that inspection but that they are also diligently working to implement a comprehensive quality improvement plan to remediate any outstanding observations within this facility pfizer has also confirmed to novartis sandoz that the resolution of this warning letter remains a top priority for their company and they are working with the fda to resolve any remaining concerns as quickly as possible we also continue to work very closely with sandoz to explore other possible avenues that could allow us to get glatopa milligram product to market we are in the process of evaluating potential second source fillfinish manufacturers with the equipment necessary and the available capacity to supply the product to the market based on the work pfizer has already done to resolve the observations and the warning letter and the effort sandoz is putting forth to resolve the warning letter we still believe there is potential for approval on launch of glatopa  milligram in the  timeframe we hope to be able to provide more definitive timing on approval in the coming months on the legal front as noted in our prior calls teva has appealed the district court and ipr determinations singing various  milligram orange book patent invalid to the cafc briefing will continue through the summer and the decision on the validity of these patents is expected from the cafc later this year or in early  teva filed a case on the fifth milligram orange book patent earlier this year however all parties recently filed a motion to dismiss this suite teva also filed a patent case earlier this year filtration patent which is in the early stages of litigation we continue to seek the indiscernible release in delaware the teva’s new filtration patent is invalid not infringed and unenforceable teva has discontinued its efforts to seek preliminary injunctive relief at this time turning to our glatopa milligram product as a reminder the fda’s warning letter does not restrict the production or shipment of glatopa milligram and sandoz continues to supply the us market with this highquality more affordable generic glatopa milligram also remains the sole generic product on the market for patients with rrms and now captures approximately  of the milligram us glatiramer acetate market in the first quarter of  we recorded  million in product revenues from sales of glatopa milligram we are pleased that this revenue stream continues to provide steady funding for our business now to biosimilars and i will start with our lead biosimilar candidate m our biosimilar humira candidate in january we announced that we had negotiated the early termination of m collaboration agreement with baxalta now whollyowned by shire also as part of the early termination momenta received a onetime payment of  million from baxalta to fund the estimated costs of performing the development activities through september  since then we have completed the majority of the transfer responsibility for m from baxalta back to momenta our development and regulatory teams are now working to prepare us and eu submissions for the product this program remains on track for a first submission for marketing approval in the mid timeframe now that we have full ownership of this latestage program we are evaluating our options for potentially capturing significantly more value from this program as we stated in the past we have had inquiries from interested parties and are now in active discussions with multiple potential collaboration partners and evaluating different opportunities to maximize the value of this asset as you know deals take some time to negotiate and we will update you as soon as we have news that we can communicate i will now turn to our biosimilar collaboration with mylan and start with m our biosimilar orencia candidate the phase  study is progressing and enrollment is now complete we expect to report top line data in the second half of  and are now beginning preparations for a phase  study for m on the ip front in january the ptab upheld the validity of bristolmyers squibb’s  subcutaneous formulation patent for orencia that expires in  we have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals bms has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal which is pending before the court and we continue to expect the case to proceed to a decision in april  based on the court’s decision we have adjusted our strategy to allow us to proceed independent of the outcome we remain confident in the development strategy for m and believe we have a pathway to launch m at market formation or in the  timeframe lastly on biosimilars we are progressing m the next biosimilar candidate we and mylan prioritized for development as part of our collaboration we expect to initiate a clinical trial for m in late  or early  and we will disclose the biosimilar candidate closer to that timeframe moving onto our novel drug pipeline i will start with our lead novel candidate m our recombinant antifcrn candidate designed to be a novel bestinclass monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with antibody mediated disease we have successfully completed the phase i single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers data from this portion of the study show that a single dose of  mg per kg achieved up to  reduction of circulating igg antibodies in approximately  days and maintain approximately  reduction of igg for about  days m was well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed in january we initiated the multiple ascending dose portion of the study data continued to look strong and the safety profile is clean so far we expect to release the full data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study in the second half of  now to m a recombinant homogeneous fc trimer that antagonizes the activating fc gamma receptor system and blocks immune complex media and tissue damage earlier this year we announced a license agreement and a collaboration with csl for the development of m and other next generation fc multimer programs the collaboration became effective february  and since then we have been working closely with csl through a joint steering committee to put together development plan for m the program is on track to enter the clinic in the fourth quarter of this year as a reminder the agreement with csl provides us the option to fund  of global research and development and us commercialization and manufacturing costs in exchange for either a  share of the us profits or a  share of the us profit depending on the stage of development at which we make the decision we expect to make our decision on the first optimum point midyear importantly we also have opt out rights under the cofunding arrangement should we decide that we have to limit our investment depending on our capital needs in the future if at any time we choose to opt out milestone payments and royalties will revert back to their original prearrangement amounts in addition to advancing m the agreement initiates a research collaboration to develop additional fc multimer proteins that may originate from momenta’s or csl’s research i am pleased to report the joint steering committee has finalized a research plan that will initiate work on the development of the collaboration’s next generation fc multiple programs shortly i had the opportunity to visit csl’s headquarters in australia and spent time with their teams recently and i came away very impressed by their company and their team and i feel we have initiated a very strong collaboration m is a top priority in their portfolio and we are both excited about the direction our research collaboration is going finally on novel drugs i will discuss m our hypersialylated ivig program designed as a potentially high potency version of ivig the program continues to progress nicely and we are on track to initiate an indenabling toxicology study this year we expect to initiate a clinical trial in  in closing we remain optimistic for our potential approval and launch of glatopa  milligram this year and the nearterm value it could create for our company our glatopa  miligram product continues to provide steady revenues and our balance sheet is well positioned to fund our ongoing programs over the next  years beyond glatopa our portfolio of biosimilars and novel drugs is advancing well our goal is to be able to launch one or more of these products per year beginning in  this portfolio has the potential to create significant value for our company our shareholders and the patients we look to serve and with that i will turn the call over to scott scott storer thanks craig good morning everyone i will now review our financial results for the first quarter of  and provide guidance for q and the full year we reported a net loss for the first quarter of  million compared to a net loss of  million in the same quarter of last year revenues for the first quarter totaled  million compared with  million for the same period in  first quarter  revenue included  million in product revenue all of which was profit share we earned from the sandoz sales of glatopa  mg this compares to  million in product revenue earned from sandoz sales of glatopa  mg for the same period of  collaborative research and development revenues which includes  million of revenue recognized from mylan’s original  million upfront payment decreased to  million from  million in the first quarter of  the decrease was primarily due to the termination of the m collaboration with baxalta effective december   first quarter rd expense increased to  million when compared to  million in the same period of  the increase in rd expense was due to the increased spending on m following the transition of the program back to momenta please note that the incremental spending for m is funded through september  via the  million payment from baxalta as a reminder costs incurred by the company under the mylan collaboration are recorded net of mylan’s  share of our expenses plus our  share of any collaboration expenses incurred by mylan first quarter ga expense increased to  million from  million in the same period in  the increase was primarily due to an increase of  million in legal fees and  million in personnel related expenses primarily due to share based compensation expense the company previously gave operating expense guidance that expected nongaap operating expenses for the first quarter of  to be approximately  million to  million per quarter our nongaap operating expense is defined as total operating expenses less stock based compensation and less collaborative reimbursement revenues for the first quarter of  our total operating expenses of  million less stock based compensation of  million and less collaborative reimbursement revenues of  million totaled  million which is at the lower end of our  million to  million guidance range we started the first quarter with  million in cash during the first quarter we received a onetime asset return payment of  million from baxalta in connection with the early termination of the collaboration agreement for m and a  million upfront license fee from csl in addition during the first quarter we recorded net proceeds of  million from the sale of common stock from a previously approved  million atm financing facility we ended the first quarter with  million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities now turning to guidance today we are reiterating that we expect nongaap operating expenses will be approximately  million to  million for  specifically for q we expect nongaap operating expenses to be  million to  million our current full year spending projections include approximately  million of spending on m  million of which has already been already paid by shire as part of the termination agreement and for which net income was realized in q  also as a reminder we continued to expect to recognize  million of revenue per quarter from mylan’s  million upfront payment in addition we expect to fully recognize a  million upfront payment from csl as revenue in the second half of  after the completion of a predefined milestone in the csl  collaboration agreement we will now open the call to questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris schott from jpmorgan your line is now open dana flanders hi thanks this is actually dana flanders on for chris my first question just on the warning letter do you have any sense at this point if the fda is looking at the mcpherson plant in isolation or if they may be taking just a broader view of the legacy hospira network given some of the past compliance issues that i know they have mentioned in their warning letter and then i have a quick followup craig wheeler sure dana thanks this is craig we don’t really have that degree of insight into it obviously whenever a warning letter is issued the agency takes a look at the bold record of the company but everything that we have seen are really directly related to the mcpherson plant but again we don’t have any specific insight into the broader issue that pfizer may or may not be dealing with dana flanders okay thanks and my second just quick followup it sounds like you are satisfied with pfizer’s response todate and the just their efforts to resolve the issue so are you still looking at either switching facilities or suppliers or just either backup plans in case remediation is extended and just how big of focus for you is that at this point and when would you have enough information to make that decision thank you craig wheeler sure i would say of course we are looking at every opportunity we have been to be able to get the product to the market as soon as possible the primary focus is resolution to the warning letter and your question was asking are we satisfied with pfizer’s attention yes i am it is very clear that both pfizer and novartis have placed this as a very high priority and have put all hands on deck to try get this warning letter resolved the review that we had of the submission that they have made to the original  certainly indicated to us that pfizer was taking seriously the  and so significant progress is made even before the warning letter came but we are looking at alternative sites because you never know you asked the part – first part of the question we don’t have insights into their broader message here on the old full set of hospira facilities or not and so we are and we will continue to do that until know exactly what the path to market is dana flanders great thank you very much craig wheeler sure thanks operator our next question comes from the line of tom shrader from stifel your line is now open tom shrader hi good morning thanks for taking the questions if i can followup on the last line of questioning a little bit if you were to identify a second site say today how long would it be before you were up and running can you give us any sense of what that process would involve craig wheeler well i can give a sense of the process i don’t think i have the math in front of me in terms of being exactly how long it would take but the first thing whenever you go into a new fillfinish site is you actually have to either have the equipment necessary to fill their particular products you are or have to make modifications to have their line ready to be able to fill once that’s done it’s a pretty straightforward process you have to run the process to get a registration batch you put it on stability as you differ anything that you filed for a change in site so there is a period that would vary depending upon the current capacity and capability of the vendor and then once it’s done it’s a pretty set timeline in terms of doing with stability and then the review period of the fda which is on a case like this probably a six months to eight months review tom shrader okay perfect and then for  is it safe to say that the legal issues have jammed things up enough you are likely to be ready to launch when anyone is able to launch is it going to all hold everyone at once now is that your expectation craig wheeler my expectation is that the legal issues are certainly going to impact everybody in this race and therefore our statement that we think we will be there at market formation holds based upon our own view of our own both development strategy and legal strategy will everybody be there at once probably not but you can certainly expect there will be more than one product there i think everybody is going to have their own set of legal issues depending upon their own program and how they pursuit the legal issues either ipr or through the patent dance once they actually file a product so we do expect it to be competitive market when it launches tom shrader okay perfect thanks a lot craig craig wheeler certainly thank you operator our next question comes from the line of douglas tsao from barclays your line is now open douglas tsao hi good morning so craig just following up on m obviously you are still pursuing the ipr process and new fields process on the  patent but based on your comments i mean does that suggest you have – you believe that from the formulation side that you have alternative means to potentially bring that product to market craig wheeler i am being very careful for competitive reasons since you were talking about specifically where we are in development but i think i will just repeat the words i would say carefully is that with the patent case we have adjusted our development strategy and we believe independent of the outcome of the appeal that we will have a path to market to be able to launch at market formation so we are clearly thinking about a number of different directions here douglas tsao okay and then just obviously between  and  as well as the partnership with mylan you have got a lot going on the biosimilars side or when do you expect to sort of talk more broadly about sort of traditional molecules and with those primarily go through the mylan partnership or at what point do you start to think about sort of trying to build out sort of the standalone business or portfolio for yourself craig wheeler well i think right now we still have quite a bit of work to do on the mylan portfolio that’s keeping us plenty busy so i don’t think you would see us extending dramatically on biosimilars beyond that at this point we only announced one we anticipate another – the second part of that to mylan when it goes to the clinic which is hopefully the end of this year or beginning of next year and then after that we have a regular pace as we have talked about with the mylan programs and so right now i think our plate is pretty full in terms of the number of programs that we are working on and i think there has been a lot of work that we have to pick up in taking the humira candidate back from the baxalta because it’s an interesting indiscernible to do this before kind of go from a standing start to trying to file a program and pick up all the responsibilities for it in about six months and so our team is very busy with that right now so i am not saying never saying never but i would say right now you should expect we are pretty busy with indiscernible on the biosimilars side douglas tsao and then just one final quick question on  i mean to the extent that how much is sort of in terms of finding a new partner for that sort of dictated by sort of rethinking the legal strategy and some of the recent developments on that front in terms of the ip estate craig wheeler i think our partner look us kind of independent of the ip side of things i mean we have said that our goal is to maximize the value of the program and so we have prioritized outlicensing versus more creative may be channel kinds of partnerships right now because we have had this delay on the glatopa  milligram revenues but i think we are looking at what could we do on our own what happens out there with a partner what’s the opportunity globally could we get into the market earlier in different parts of the globe all of those types of things are really factoring into our partner discussions douglas tsao okay great thank you very much craig wheeler sure thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jason gerberry from leerink partners your line is now open etzer darout hi how are you this is etzer filling in for jason just one quick question on the m just wanted to know i guess based on your earlier comments when can we expect the next clinical updates for that program just trying to get a sense of what the developmental regulatory timeline would be for that product to reach the market thank you craig wheeler sure so right now our plan is to actually enter the clinic with phase  in the fourth quarter of this year so you should think about it phase  which is typically about a year long by the time we get through all of that and then depending upon the results there we would make a choice of which indication and some indications would be quicker to market some would take longer and so i really don’t think i am in a position of predicting and give exactly when we will reach market depending on if we choose a longer product indication or a shortterm acute indication and the results of the phase  will really dictate that so we are in the process of putting that development plan together with csl right now and we will be able to give some more color of that when we get into the clinic but it really is going to dependent on the indication to enter those timelines to the market etzer darout great thank you craig wheeler sure thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mark goodman from ubs your line is now open ami fadia hi this is ami fadia for mark couple of questions just as you think about the partnership opportunities for humira how much of it would be determined by sort of just the deal structure and would you need to be able to fund some of the development going forward for the program or any other – through that partnership i have one or two other followups but let me make free to answer this one craig wheeler sure so i think the important thing for us is to be able to retain a reasonable revenue stream out of that product and so that could come in a number of ways and we are looking at deals which allow us to get a significantly higher either profit share or royalty than we got out of the original baxalta deal and so that’s kind of number one for us this program the trials are done at this point and it’s covered through september with the payment so the kind of things that we would be paying for now is going to launch preparation types of things as well as legal things and so there is still a significant amount of spend going forward but it’s not really development expenses it’s more on the supply and the legal side and obviously we would be very helpful to have somebody partnering on those because the legal expenses could go over some time here and so that’s a component of it but i think our focus is value for the company in the long run for the product right now ami fadia got it on the glatopa milligram what gives you confidence that there is still a possibility of being able to launch the product this year because you have mentioned that the warning letter is the key thing preventing in approval and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to go away plus an alternative site would take much longer so what gives you confidence for  launch craig wheeler yes i think it really is the progress that pfizer has made in terms of getting their plant in shape so they didn’t get a standing start when they got the warning letter they started way back in – when they got the  back in last june and july and that’s what gives me at least a possibility of seeing a launch this year if you look at the timing of resolution of the warning letters the medium somewhere around  to  or something like that but there is – that means there is a whole bunch that are shorter than that and i think from what i have seen so far what we have seen in terms of what pfizer has done in the commitment to it there is a reasonable chance that they will actually resolve the warning letter in a shorter period of time than the full year ami fadia got it and then maybe just two other quick questions just one on glatopa milligram the reported revenues for momenta were much higher than we were anticipating is there – and we followed the ims scripts and that didn’t show that type of a spike so are there additional volumes that are not being captured by ims here or was there some additional inventory or net price change in the quarter and then secondly – yes go ahead scott storer sorry certainly there is a portion that’s not captured in ims i don’t know what percentage that is but there is always some inaccuracy in that but i think when we look at it i think we are about the same market share that we were on last quarter so you are seeing some variation in accounts and timing of accounts but i don’t think you should look at this as a transition to a major growth period for the product i think we are seeing just quartertoquarter variations here ami fadia okay and then just lastly on the csl upfront i may not have heard correctly you said you will record this as revenue in the second half of this year or would you start amortizing it scott storer no the current expectations that’s currently seeing the balance sheet as a deferred revenue balance there is actually a predefined milestone in the agreement that we expect is going to add either late q or early q when that gets triggered then we will recognize the full  million in the back half of  so that will not be amortized it will be a lump recognition ami fadia so the  million will be a lumped recognition but then is that the milestone or is that the – the upfront is a balance sheet item but then the milestone is how much scott storer i don’t think we have disclosed what the ongoing milestones for  are going to look like we have talked about  million in total for development in commercial milestone but the original  million upfront payment is currently sitting on the balance sheet as a deferred revenue item the balance is in our cash balance and we will recognize that in the pl in the second half of  craig wheeler yes so as scott was referring to in his initial comment was that there is a certain sect of activities that have to happen before we can recognize that and once that happens it will trigger the  million recognition ami fadia got it that makes sense thank you okay craig wheeler yes operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of liav abraham from citi your line is now open liav abraham good morning craig based on your commentary on pfizer’s development for progress of the warning letter and you said that there is possibility potentially for approval this year it seems as though based on your comments that if an approval would have come it would be at the very back end of the year is that a fair comment and also taking into account the fact that i think sandoz did remove glatopa milligram from their  guidance any specificity on timing would be helpful craig wheeler yes i wish i could you give you more obviously we are going to work to see as soon as absolutely possible but i do think sandoz is looking at this as it maybe towards the second half of the year and so i think they have been – they have made their own decisions in terms of how they are changing the guidance obviously we don’t give guidance on the revenue side but we do think that things are working there is ongoing dialogue with the fda and where pfizer is but there is a possibility but second half of the year is probably a better timeframe liav abraham got it and then just on the next steps for pfizer and the resolution of this warning letter you mentioned that a response has been submitted by pfizer to the fda what are the next steps based on your understanding to the fda have to accept the responses and their response and agree to it today it is probably in the inspection that needs to take place and how involved are you in momenta in this process craig wheeler so i will answer your last first is that we are – you think of us as observers we aren’t very involved at all because we have – it’s sandoz novartis and pfizer that are really handing this and the process by once a response has been issued it varies it varies depending upon the quality of the response the questions of the fda had sometimes there are verbal exchanges sometimes there is a review and a second set of questions sometimes there is a resolution or a reinspection that happens pretty quickly and we don’t have good view to exactly that detail of what’s happening when so i can’t give you any specific resolution process for the specific warning letter because it does vary from letter to letter liav abraham how frequently are you kept in the loop and how good is the interaction craig wheeler our interaction is primarily with sandoz and so we get our information from them with obviously permission from pfizer that we see that information so if we have a little bit of a delay in terms of when we get that information but we are in very frequent contact as you would imagine liav abraham got it thank you very much craig wheeler sure thank you operator and that concludes our qa session and now i would like to turn the call back to mr craig wheeler ceo for any further remarks craig wheeler sure thank you very much i just want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us for our first quarter

responsible for supernovae and their progeny neutron stars and black holes it examines the theoretical ideas behind black holes and their manifestation in observational astronomy and presents neutron stars in all their variety known today this book also covers the physics of the twentieth century discussing quantum theory and einsteins gravity how these two theories collide and the prospects for their reconciliation in the twentyfirst century this will be essential reading for undergraduate students in astronomy and astrophysics and an excellent accessible introduction for a wider audience

published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide we derive the criteria for deflagration to detonation transition ddt in a type ia supernova the theory is based on the two major assumptions i detonation is triggered via the zeldovich gradient mechanism inside a region of mixed fuel and products ji the mixed region is produced by a turbulent mixing of fuel and products either inside an active deflagration front or during the global expansion and subsequent contraction of an exploding white dwarf we determine the critical size of the mixed region required to initiate a detonation in a degenerate carbon oxygen mixture this critical length is much larger than the width of the reaction front of a chapmanjouguet detonation however at densities greater than   x exp gcc it is much smaller than the size of a white dwarf we derive the critical turbulent intensity required to create the mixed region inside an active deflagration front in which a detonation can form we conclude that the density rho sub sigma at which a detonation can form in a carbonoxygen white dwarf is low approximately less than  to  x exp gcc but greater than  x exp gcc a theory of ddt in unconfined flames by alexei m khokhlov book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper outlines a theoretical approach for predicting the onset of detonation in unconfined turbulent flames two basic assumptions are made  the gradient mechanism is the inherent mechanism that leads to ddt in unconfined conditions and  the sole mechanism for preparing the gradient in induction time is by turbulent mixing and local flame quenching the criterion for ddt is derived in terms of the onedimensional detonation wave thickness the laminar flame speed and the laminar flame thickness in the reactive gas this approach gives a lowerbound criterion for ddt for conditions where shock preheating wall effects and interactions with obstacles are absent regions in parameter space where unconfined ddt can and cannot occur are determined disk instabilities in close binary systems   years of the diskinstability model  proceedings of the
