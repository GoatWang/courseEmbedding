 great laughs are added with pansy the baby chimpanzee and willy worm the bookworm  laughs keep coming as a member of the audience is invited on stage to become a “live” puppet“adventure in reading”willy worm takes kids on an “adventure in reading” where they not only explore how reading opens up a world of learning but also why reading is important they also learn about “classics” and how to use their imagination a highlight is when willy tells them a hilarious “fractured” version of a story he has just read kids are amazed when a drawing of a classic book comes to life before their eyes“colorado history and classic books”history and learning is great fun for grades   “torrance n tabor” a mining prospector from the early days of colorado together with “buckaroo buddy” a wagon trail master take kids on a historical journey that is fun funny and educational they will also learn about classic books and enjoy the recreation of the frankenstein operation “puppet and ventriloquism workshops”workshops provide a wonderful opportunity for kids to explore the art of puppetry and ventriloquism  in many ways puppetry incorporates most of the performing arts  theatre

pathways in complex biological networks the anabolic and catabolic processes that determine tissue composition adaptations to environmental stresses and how their failure leads to disease not most biochemistry or molecular biology departments it is our belief that the study of physiologic chemistry metabolic regulation using modern tracer techniques and metabolic control concepts can be seized by nutrition researchers interested in making fundamental contributions to biochemistry and medicine and in being fundedtoward this end our laboratory has focused on measuring a variety of intracellular metabolic processes not previously accessible to study in vivo our goal has always been to answer questions concerning the regulation of diseasemodifying pathways by diet genes drugs and other factors and to apply these techniques in humans because methods for studying the behavior of fully assembled living systems have lagged remarkably – in comparison to techniques for characterizing chemical structure of isolated components of these systems for example much effort in our laboratory is spent on methods development accordingly we have developed new in vivo stable isotopemass spectrometric methods for measuring endogenous synthesis or transport rates of biomolecules such as fatty acids cholesterol proteins and carbohydrates and proliferation rates of cells these techniques include mass isotopomer distribution analysis mida a universal technique for measuring polymerization biosynthesis heavy water labeling for quantifying dna replication and cell proliferation rates dilution techniques for measuring reverse cholesterol transport fluxes and methods for measuring the dynamics of brain molecules among many othersa number of basic questions in metabolic physiology have been addressed in this manner do humans convert excess carbohydrate calories to fat surprisingly no do gene expression profiles accurately represent the flow of lipogenic and adipogenic pathways in adipose tissue of obese mice no pathway fluxes need to be measured can the powerful effects of chronic caloric restriction on the promotional phase of carcinogenesis be replicated by alternateday fasting regimens yes and even better these regimens can be modified to permit some energy intake on the “fast” day without loss of effects can metabolic pathways in neurons in the brain be modulated and monitored for therapeutic benefit very much so the axonal microtubule assemblydisassembly cycle for example with effects on axonal transport of cargo or new brain cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus and so onaccordingly our group is involved in a number of projects these include studies of obesitydiabetes the dynamics of adipose tissue components including lipids adipocytes and macrophages and dyslipidemias reverse cholesterol transport and hdl functionality sources of triglycerides secreted from the liver as vldl the effects of commonly used agents with important metabolic effects cigarette smoking alcohol protein metabolism and body composition in wasting disorders role of cytokines rational development of new therapies including growth hormone
