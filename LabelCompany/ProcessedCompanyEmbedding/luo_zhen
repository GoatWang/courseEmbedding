historical sources on lady zhens life  personal name  in popular culture  see also  notes  references early lifeedit lady zhen was from wuji county  zhongshan commandery  which is in presentday wuji county hebei she was a descendant of zhen han  who served as a grand protector  in the late western han dynasty and later the generalinchief  during the shortlived xin dynasty her father zhen yi  served as the prefect  of shangcai county  in the late eastern han dynasty he died when lady zhen was about three years old lady zhens mother whose maiden family name was zhang  was from changshan commandery  around presentday zhengding county hebei lady zhens parents had three sons and five daughters eldest son zhen yu  who died early second son zhen yan  who became a xiaolian and later served as an assistant  to the generalinchief  and as the chief  of quliang county  third son zhen yao  who was also a xiaolian eldest daughter zhen jiang  second daughter zhen tuo  third daughter zhen dao  fourth daughter zhen rong  lady zhen was the youngest of the five daughters zhen yi once brought his children to meet liu liang  a fortune teller who commented on lady zhen this girl will become very noble in the future unlike many children of her age the young lady zhen did not enjoy playing once when she was eight years old her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horseriding performers outside their house but lady zhen did not join in her sisters were puzzled so they asked her and she responded is this something a girl should watch when she was nine years old she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers writing materials her brothers told her you should be learning what women traditionally do such as weaving when you picked up reading were you thinking of becoming a female academician lady zhen replied i heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them if they didnt read how did they learn all that towards the end of the eastern han dynasty after the death of emperor ling china entered a chaotic period because the central governments authority weakened and regional officials and warlords started fighting each other in a bid to gain supremacy the common people suffered from poverty and hunger and many wealthy households who owned expensive items such as jewellery offered to sell these valuables in return for food lady zhens family had large stockpiles of grain and they planned to take advantage of the situation to sell their grain in exchange for valuable items lady zhen who about  years old at the time said to her mother its not wrong to own expensive items but in this chaotic era owning such items has become a wrongdoing our neighbours are suffering from hunger so why dont we distribute our surplus grain to our fellow townsfolk this is an act of graciousness and kindness her family praised her for her suggestion and heeded her advice when lady zhen was  her second brother zhen yan  died and she was deeply grieved she continued to show respect towards zhen yans widow and even helped to raise zhen yans son lady zhens mother was particularly strict towards her daughtersinlaw and treated them harshly lady zhen told her mother its unfortunate that second brother died early second sisterinlaw became widowed at such a young age and shes now left with only her son you should treat your daughtersinlaw better and love them as you would love your own daughters lady zhens mother was so deeply touched that she cried and she started treating her daughtersinlaw better and allowed them to accompany and wait on her marriages to yuan xi and cao piedit sometime in the middle of the jianan era – of the reign of emperor xian lady zhen married yuan xi the second son of yuan shao a warlord who controlled much of northern china yuan shao later put yuan xi in charge of you province so yuan xi left to assume his appointment lady zhen did not follow her husband and remained in ye in presentday handan hebei the administrative centre of yuan shaos domain to take care of her motherinlaw yuan shao lost to his rival cao cao at the battle of guandu in  ce and died two years later after his death his sons yuan tan and yuan shang became embroiled in internecine struggles over their fathers vast domain when the yuan brothers were exhausted from their wars against each other cao cao attacked and defeated them swiftly conquering the territories that used to be controlled by the yuans in  cao cao defeated yuan shang at the battle of ye and his forces occupied the city cao caos son cao pi entered yuan shaos residence and met lady liu yuan shaos widow and lady zhen lady zhen was so terrified that she buried her face in her motherinlaws lap cao pi said whats going on madam liu ask that lady to lift up her head cao pi was very impressed and entranced by lady zhens beauty when he saw her his father allowed him to marry her later another account of this incident stated that lady liu and lady zhen were in yuan shangs residence when cao pi entered lady zhens hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her motherinlaw when cao pi asked lady liu told him the woman behind her was yuan xis wife cao pi was so entranced by lady zhens beauty that he married her and treated her well yuan xi was still alive at the time yuan shang came to join him after his defeat by cao cao in  cao cao defeated yuan xi yuan shang and their wuhuan allies at the battle of white wolf mountain after which they fled to liaodong to join the warlord gongsun kang gongsun kang feared that they would become a threat to him so he lured them into a trap executed them and sent their heads to cao cao as cao pis wifeedit lady zhen bore cao pi a son and a daughter their son cao rui later became the second emperor of the state of cao wei in the three kingdoms period their daughter whose personal name was not recorded in history was referred to as princess dongxiang  literally princess of the east district in historical records lady zhen remained humble even though cao pi deeply fancied her she provided encouragement to cao pis other wives who were also adored by him and comforted those whom he less favoured she also often urged cao pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants citing the example of the mythical yellow emperor cao pi was very pleased once cao pi wanted to send lady ren  one of his concubines who fell out favour with him back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her when lady zhen heard about it she told her husband lady ren comes from a reputable clan i cant match her in terms of moral character and looks why do you want to send her away cao pi replied she is unruly impulsive and disobedient she has made me angry many times before im sending her away lady zhen wept and pleaded with her husband everyone knows that you love and adore me and theyll think that youre sending lady ren away because of me i fear that ill be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me please consider your decision again carefully cao pi ignored her and sent lady ren away in  cao cao embarked on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by ma chao and han sui leading to the battle of tong pass and the subsequent battles cao caos wife lady bian followed her husband and stayed at meng ford  presentday mengjin county henan while cao pi remained in ye in presentday handan hebei lady bian fell ill during that time lady zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night she constantly sent messengers to inquire her motherinlaws condition but refused to believe them when they reported that lady bian was getting better and she became filled with greater anxiety lady bian later wrote a letter to her telling her that she had fully recovered and only then did lady zhens worries disappear about a year later when lady bian returned to ye lady zhen rushed to see her motherinlaw and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them lady bian assured lady zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety in  cao cao launched another campaign to attack the southeastern warlord sun quan leading to the battle of ruxu in  lady bian cao pi cao rui and princess dongxiang all followed cao cao on the campaign but lady zhen remained in ye because she was sick when cao pi and lady zhens children returned to ye in late  after the campaign lady bians attendants were surprised to see that lady zhen was very cheerful they asked lady youve not seen your children for about a year we thought you would miss them and be worried about them but yet youre so optimistic why is that so lady zhen laughed and replied why should i be worried when cao rui and the others are with madam lady bian deathedit after cao cao died in early  his vassal king title – king of wei  – was inherited by cao pi later that year cao pi forced emperor xian whom he paid nominal allegiance to to abdicate in his favour effectively ending the han dynasty cao pi became the emperor and established the state of cao wei which marked the beginning of the three kingdoms period the dethroned emperor xian was reduced to the status of a duke – the duke of shanyang  the former emperor presented his two daughters to cao pi to be his concubines cao pi began to favour his other concubines especially guo nüwang when lady zhen realised that cao pi favoured her less she started complaining cao pi was furious when he heard about it in the sixth lunar month of  he sent an emissary to ye in presentday handan hebei to force lady zhen to commit suicide lady zhen was buried in ye after her death lady zhens downfall was due to guo nüwang whom cao pi fancied one year after lady zhens death cao pi instated guo as the empress despite opposition from an official zhan qian  the historical text han jin chunqiu  mentioned that lady zhens body was desecrated after her death – her face was covered by her hair and rice husks were stuffed into her mouth cao rui was raised by guo nüwang after lady zhens death alternative account of lady zhens deathedit the wei shu  mentioned that cao pi issued an edict to lady zhen asking her to move to the newly constructed changqiu palace 秋宮 in luoyang lady zhen declined humbly stating that she felt that she was not capable enough to manage the imperial harem and also because she was ill cao pi then

advantage of the possibilities inherent in a triangle involving a beautiful lady an emperor and his romanticised brother a tradition dating back to at least as far as an undated anonymous note edited into the tang dynasty writer li shans annotated wen xuan had cao zhi meeting the ghost of the recently deceased empress zhen and writing a poem originally titled gan zhen fu  rhapsody on being moved by lady zhen afterwards cao rui found this poem about his uncles love for his mother and changed the title to luo shen fu 神賦 which could be translated as rhapsody on the goddess of the luo or rhapsody on the divine luo this second interpretation presumably referencing lady zhens personal name luo if true this would be a forename unique to early china as the chinese character  has been a toponym

lady zhen did not enjoy playing once when she was eight years old her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horseriding performers outside their house but lady zhen did not join in her sisters were puzzled so they asked her and she responded is this something a girl should watch when she was nine years old she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers writing materials her brothers told her you should be learning what women traditionally do such as weaving when you picked up reading were you thinking of becoming a female academician lady zhen replied i heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them if they didnt read how did they learn all that towards the end of the eastern han dynasty after the death of emperor ling china entered a chaotic period because the central governments authority weakened and regional officials and warlords started fighting each other in a bid to gain supremacy the common people suffered from poverty and hunger and many wealthy households who owned expensive items such as jewellery offered to sell these valuables in return for food lady zhens family had large stockpiles of grain and they planned to take advantage of the situation to sell their grain in exchange for valuable items lady zhen who about  years old at the time said to her mother its not wrong to own expensive items but in this chaotic era owning such items has become a wrongdoing our neighbours are suffering from hunger so why dont we distribute our surplus grain to our fellow townsfolk this is an act of graciousness and kindness her family praised her for her suggestion and heeded her advice when lady zhen was  her second brother zhen yan  died and she was deeply grieved she continued to show respect towards zhen yans widow and even helped to raise zhen yans son lady zhens mother was particularly strict towards her daughtersinlaw and treated them harshly lady zhen told her mother its unfortunate that second brother died early second sisterinlaw became widowed at such a young age and shes now left with only her son you should treat your daughtersinlaw better and love them as you would love your own daughters lady zhens mother was so deeply touched that she cried and she started treating her daughtersinlaw better and allowed them to accompany and wait on her marriages to yuan xi and cao piedit sometime in the middle of the jianan era – of the reign of emperor xian lady zhen married yuan xi the second son of yuan shao a warlord who controlled much of northern china yuan shao later put yuan xi in charge of you province so yuan xi left to assume his appointment lady zhen did not follow her husband and remained in ye in presentday handan hebei the administrative centre of yuan shaos domain to take care of her motherinlaw yuan shao lost to his rival cao cao at the battle of guandu in  ce and died two years later after his death his sons yuan tan and yuan shang became embroiled in internecine struggles over their fathers vast domain when the yuan brothers were exhausted from their wars against each other cao cao attacked and defeated them swiftly conquering the territories that used to be controlled by the yuans in  cao cao defeated yuan shang at the battle of ye and his forces occupied the city cao caos son cao pi entered yuan shaos residence and met lady liu yuan shaos widow and lady zhen lady zhen was so terrified that she buried her face in her motherinlaws lap cao pi said whats going on madam liu ask that lady to lift up her head cao pi was very impressed and entranced by lady zhens beauty when he saw her his father allowed him to marry her later another account of this incident stated that lady liu and lady zhen were in yuan shangs residence when cao pi entered lady zhens hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her motherinlaw when cao pi asked lady liu told him the woman behind her was yuan xis wife cao pi was so entranced by lady zhens beauty that he married her and treated her well yuan xi was still alive at the time yuan shang came to join him after his defeat by cao cao in  cao cao defeated yuan xi yuan shang and their wuhuan allies at the battle of white wolf mountain after which they fled to liaodong to join the warlord gongsun kang gongsun kang feared that they would become a threat to him so he lured them into a trap executed them and sent their heads to cao cao as cao pis wifeedit lady zhen bore cao pi a son and a daughter their son cao rui later became the second emperor of the state of cao wei in the three kingdoms period their daughter whose personal name was not recorded in history was referred to as princess dongxiang  literally princess of the east district in historical records lady zhen remained humble even though cao pi deeply fancied her she provided encouragement to cao pis other wives who were also adored by him and comforted those whom he less favoured she also often urged cao pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants citing the example of the mythical yellow emperor cao pi was very pleased once cao pi wanted to send lady ren  one of his concubines who fell out favour with him back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her when lady zhen heard about it she told her husband lady ren comes from a reputable clan i cant match her in terms of moral character and looks why do you want to send her away cao pi replied she is unruly impulsive and disobedient she has made me angry many times before im sending her away lady zhen wept and pleaded with her husband everyone knows that you love and adore me and theyll think that youre sending lady ren away because of me i fear that ill be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me please consider your decision again carefully cao pi ignored her and sent lady ren away in  cao cao embarked on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by ma chao and han sui leading to the battle of tong pass and the subsequent battles cao caos wife lady bian followed her husband and stayed at meng ford  presentday mengjin county henan while cao pi remained in ye in presentday handan hebei lady bian fell ill during that time lady zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night she constantly sent messengers to inquire her motherinlaws condition but refused to believe them when they reported that lady bian was getting better and she became filled with greater anxiety lady bian later wrote a letter to her telling her that she had fully recovered and only then did lady zhens worries disappear about a year later when lady bian returned to ye lady zhen rushed to see her motherinlaw and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them lady bian assured lady zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety in  cao cao launched another campaign to attack the southeastern warlord sun quan leading to the battle of ruxu in  lady bian cao pi cao rui and princess dongxiang all followed cao cao on the campaign but lady zhen remained in ye because she was sick when cao pi and lady zhens children returned to ye in late  after the campaign lady bians attendants were surprised to see that lady zhen was very cheerful they asked lady youve not seen your children for about a year we thought you would miss them and be worried about them but yet youre so optimistic why is that so lady zhen laughed and replied why should i be worried when cao rui and the others are with madam lady bian deathedit after cao cao died in early  his vassal king title – king of wei  – was inherited by cao pi later that year cao pi forced emperor xian whom he paid nominal allegiance to to abdicate in his favour effectively ending the han dynasty cao pi became the emperor and established the state of cao wei which marked the beginning of the three kingdoms period the dethroned emperor xian was reduced to the status of a duke – the duke of shanyang  the former emperor presented his two daughters to cao pi to be his concubines cao pi began to favour his other concubines especially guo nüwang when lady zhen realised that cao pi favoured her less she started complaining cao pi was furious when he heard about it in the sixth lunar month of  he sent an emissary to ye in presentday handan hebei to force lady zhen to commit suicide lady zhen was buried in ye after her death lady zhens downfall was due to guo nüwang whom cao pi fancied one year after lady zhens death cao pi instated guo as the empress despite opposition from an official zhan qian  the historical text han jin chunqiu  mentioned that lady zhens body was desecrated after her death – her face was covered by her hair and rice husks were stuffed into her mouth cao rui was raised by guo nüwang after lady zhens death alternative account of lady zhens deathedit the wei shu  mentioned that cao pi issued an edict to lady zhen asking her to move to the newly constructed changqiu palace 秋宮 in luoyang lady zhen declined humbly stating that she felt that she was not capable enough to manage the imperial harem and also because she was ill cao pi then consecutively sent another two edicts but lady zhen rejected both it was around summer at the time cao pi intended to fetch lady zhen from ye to luoyang in autumn when the weather was cooler however lady zhen died of illness in ye a few months later cao pi mourned her death and posthumously elevated her to the status of an empress pei songzhi who added the wei shu account to lady zhens biography in the sanguozhi found the account dubious he believed that there were specific reasons as to why cao pi did not instate lady zhen as the empress after he became the emperor and why he forced her to commit suicide he suspected that lady zhen had probably committed an offence which was not recorded in the official histories of the cao wei state alternative theories on lady zhens deathedit many popular stories speculated that the reason for lady zhens death was that she had a secret affair with cao pis younger brother cao zhi even though this speculation is not supported by evidence and is improbable some more fantastical accounts alleged that she had an affair with cao cao as well one example of this can be found in the a new account of the tales of the world in which cao cao started the battle of ye in  to obtain lady zhen posthumous honoursedit cao pi died in  and was succeeded by cao rui who became the second ruler of cao wei cao rui granted his mother the posthumous title empress wenzhao which literally means cultured and diligent empress lady zhens family and relatives also received noble titles the historical text han jin chunqiu mentioned that cao rui had all along been aware of his mothers fate and he was angry and sad about it after he became emperor his stepmother guo nüwang became the empress dowager when he asked her about how his mother died guo replied the late emperor was the one who ordered her death so why are you asking me youre your fathers son so you can blame your dead father are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother cao rui turned furious and forced empress dowager guo to commit suicide he had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress but also ordered her dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother – hair covering face mouth stuffed with rice husks however the historical text weilüe stated that after empress dowager guo died of illness in  cao pis concubine lady li  told cao rui about the fate of his mother cao rui was deeply grieved and he ordered guos dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother reliability of alternative historical sources on lady zhens lifeedit the authoritative historical source on lady zhens life is the records of the three kingdoms sanguozhi which was written by chen shou in the third century in the fifth century pei songzhi annotated the sanguozhi by incorporating information from other texts and adding his personal commentary some sources used in the annotations include wei shu book of wei by wang chen xun yi and ruan ji weilüe brief history of wei by yu huan the original version of lady zhens biography in the sanguozhi did not contain the anecdotes about zhens excellent moral conduct such as her care for her family members her filial piety towards her motherinlaw lady bian her tolerance of cao pis other wives etc these accounts which were mostly documented in the wei shu and the weilüe were later added to the sanguozhi by pei songzhi in his commentary pei cast doubts on the anecdotes relating to the virtuous deeds of lady zhen and other noble ladies of wei because it was difficult to verify whether they were true or not due to a dearth of alternative sources the wei shu and the weilüe were among the official histories of wei so they were likely to be biased towards lady zhen hence some of those anecdotes might have been fabricated by wei historians to promote a positive image of lady zhen pei remarked that chen shou had done well in omitting the questionable information when he first compiled the sanguozhi personal nameedit lady zhens personal name was not recorded in any surviving historical text all nearcontemporary sources such as chen shous sanguozhi and xi zuochis han jin chunqiu refer to her as lady zhen  madam zhen  empress zhen  or simply the empress  the attachment of the names fu  fú and luo  luò to lady zhen came about due to the legend of a romance between her and cao zhi which robert joe cutter a specialist in research on cao zhi concludes to be a piece of anecdotal fiction inspired by the luo shen fu 神賦 rhapsody on the goddess of the luo and taking advantage of the possibilities inherent in a triangle involving a beautiful lady an emperor and his romanticised brother a tradition dating back to at least as far as an undated anonymous note edited into the tang dynasty writer li shans annotated wen xuan had cao zhi meeting the ghost of the recently deceased empress zhen and writing a poem originally titled gan zhen fu  rhapsody on being moved by lady zhen afterwards cao rui found this poem about his uncles love for his mother and changed the title to luo shen fu 神賦 which could be translated as rhapsody on the goddess of the luo or rhapsody on the divine luo this second interpretation presumably referencing lady zhens personal name luo if true this would be a forename unique to early china as the chinese character  has been a toponym since it entered the language the poem contains references to the spirit of the luo river named consort fu 妃 interpreted as a proxy for empress zhen by those who believed in cao zhis infatuation with her this interpretation becomes less allusive if empress zhens personal name was actually fu in popular cultureedit lady zhen is featured as a playable character in koeis dynasty warriors and warriors orochi video game series she is referred to as zhen ji literally means consort zhen or lady zhen in chinese in the games though like every female character in the franchise her name will be written zhenji from dynasty warriors next and warriors orochi  onward miu kamfung

lady zhen did not enjoy playing once when she was eight years old her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horseriding performers outside their house but lady zhen did not join in her sisters were puzzled so they asked her and she responded is this something a girl should watch when she was nine years old she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers writing materials her brothers told her you should be learning what women traditionally do such as weaving when you picked up reading were you thinking of becoming a female academician lady zhen replied i heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them if they didnt read how did they learn all that towards the end of the eastern han dynasty after the death of emperor ling china entered a chaotic period because the central governments authority weakened and regional officials and warlords started fighting each other in a bid to gain supremacy the common people suffered from poverty and hunger and many wealthy households who owned expensive items such as jewellery offered to sell these valuables in return for food lady zhens family had large stockpiles of grain and they planned to take advantage of the situation to sell their grain in exchange for valuable items lady zhen who about  years old at the time said to her mother its not wrong to own expensive items but in this chaotic era owning such items has become a wrongdoing our neighbours are suffering from hunger so why dont we distribute our surplus grain to our fellow townsfolk this is an act of graciousness and kindness her family praised her for her suggestion and heeded her advice when lady zhen was  her second brother zhen yan  died and she was deeply grieved she continued to show respect towards zhen yans widow and even helped to raise zhen yans son lady zhens mother was particularly strict towards her daughtersinlaw and treated them harshly lady zhen told her mother its unfortunate that second brother died early second sisterinlaw became widowed at such a young age and shes now left with only her son you should treat your daughtersinlaw better and love them as you would love your own daughters lady zhens mother was so deeply touched that she cried and she started treating her daughtersinlaw better and allowed them to accompany and wait on her marriages to yuan xi and cao piedit sometime in the middle of the jianan era – of the reign of emperor xian lady zhen married yuan xi the second son of yuan shao a warlord who controlled much of northern china yuan shao later put yuan xi in charge of you province so yuan xi left to assume his appointment lady zhen did not follow her husband and remained in ye in presentday handan hebei the administrative centre of yuan shaos domain to take care of her motherinlaw yuan shao lost to his rival cao cao at the battle of guandu in  ce and died two years later after his death his sons yuan tan and yuan shang became embroiled in internecine struggles over their fathers vast domain when the yuan brothers were exhausted from their wars against each other cao cao attacked and defeated them swiftly conquering the territories that used to be controlled by the yuans in  cao cao defeated yuan shang at the battle of ye and his forces occupied the city cao caos son cao pi entered yuan shaos residence and met lady liu yuan shaos widow and lady zhen lady zhen was so terrified that she buried her face in her motherinlaws lap cao pi said whats going on madam liu ask that lady to lift up her head cao pi was very impressed and entranced by lady zhens beauty when he saw her his father allowed him to marry her later another account of this incident stated that lady liu and lady zhen were in yuan shangs residence when cao pi entered lady zhens hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her motherinlaw when cao pi asked lady liu told him the woman behind her was yuan xis wife cao pi was so entranced by lady zhens beauty that he married her and treated her well yuan xi was still alive at the time yuan shang came to join him after his defeat by cao cao in  cao cao defeated yuan xi yuan shang and their wuhuan allies at the battle of white wolf mountain after which they fled to liaodong to join the warlord gongsun kang gongsun kang feared that they would become a threat to him so he lured them into a trap executed them and sent their heads to cao cao as cao pis wifeedit lady zhen bore cao pi a son and a daughter their son cao rui later became the second emperor of the state of cao wei in the three kingdoms period their daughter whose personal name was not recorded in history was referred to as princess dongxiang  literally princess of the east district in historical records lady zhen remained humble even though cao pi deeply fancied her she provided encouragement to cao pis other wives who were also adored by him and comforted those whom he less favoured she also often urged cao pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants citing the example of the mythical yellow emperor cao pi was very pleased once cao pi wanted to send lady ren  one of his concubines who fell out favour with him back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her when lady zhen heard about it she told her husband lady ren comes from a reputable clan i cant match her in terms of moral character and looks why do you want to send her away cao pi replied she is unruly impulsive and disobedient she has made me angry many times before im sending her away lady zhen wept and pleaded with her husband everyone knows that you love and adore me and theyll think that youre sending lady ren away because of me i fear that ill be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me please consider your decision again carefully cao pi ignored her and sent lady ren away in  cao cao embarked on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by ma chao and han sui leading to the battle of tong pass and the subsequent battles cao caos wife lady bian followed her husband and stayed at meng ford  presentday mengjin county henan while cao pi remained in ye in presentday handan hebei lady bian fell ill during that time lady zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night she constantly sent messengers to inquire her motherinlaws condition but refused to believe them when they reported that lady bian was getting better and she became filled with greater anxiety lady bian later wrote a letter to her telling her that she had fully recovered and only then did lady zhens worries disappear about a year later when lady bian returned to ye lady zhen rushed to see her motherinlaw and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them lady bian assured lady zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety in  cao cao launched another campaign to attack the southeastern warlord sun quan leading to the battle of ruxu in  lady bian cao pi cao rui and princess dongxiang all followed cao cao on the campaign but lady zhen remained in ye because she was sick when cao pi and lady zhens children returned to ye in late  after the campaign lady bians attendants were surprised to see that lady zhen was very cheerful they asked lady youve not seen your children for about a year we thought you would miss them and be worried about them but yet youre so optimistic why is that so lady zhen laughed and replied why should i be worried when cao rui and the others are with madam lady bian deathedit after cao cao died in early  his vassal king title – king of wei  – was inherited by cao pi later that year cao pi forced emperor xian whom he paid nominal allegiance to to abdicate in his favour effectively ending the han dynasty cao pi became the emperor and established the state of cao wei which marked the beginning of the three kingdoms period the dethroned emperor xian was reduced to the status of a duke – the duke of shanyang  the former emperor presented his two daughters to cao pi to be his concubines cao pi began to favour his other concubines especially guo nüwang when lady zhen realised that cao pi favoured her less she started complaining cao pi was furious when he heard about it in the sixth lunar month of  he sent an emissary to ye in presentday handan hebei to force lady zhen to commit suicide lady zhen was buried in ye after her death lady zhens downfall was due to guo nüwang whom cao pi fancied one year after lady zhens death cao pi instated guo as the empress despite opposition from an official zhan qian  the historical text han jin chunqiu  mentioned that lady zhens body was desecrated after her death – her face was covered by her hair and rice husks were stuffed into her mouth cao rui was raised by guo nüwang after lady zhens death alternative account of lady zhens deathedit the wei shu  mentioned that cao pi issued an edict to lady zhen asking her to move to the newly constructed changqiu palace 秋宮 in luoyang lady zhen declined humbly stating that she felt that she was not capable enough to manage the imperial harem and also because she was ill cao pi then consecutively sent another two edicts but lady zhen rejected both it was around summer at the time cao pi intended to fetch lady zhen from ye to luoyang in autumn when the weather was cooler however lady zhen died of illness in ye a few months later cao pi mourned her death and posthumously elevated her to the status of an empress pei songzhi who added the wei shu account to lady zhens biography in the sanguozhi found the account dubious he believed that there were specific reasons as to why cao pi did not instate lady zhen as the empress after he became the emperor and why he forced her to commit suicide he suspected that lady zhen had probably committed an offence which was not recorded in the official histories of the cao wei state alternative theories on lady zhens deathedit many popular stories speculated that the reason for lady zhens death was that she had a secret affair with cao pis younger brother cao zhi even though this speculation is not supported by evidence and is improbable some more fantastical accounts alleged that she had an affair with cao cao as well one example of this can be found in the a new account of the tales of the world in which cao cao started the battle of ye in  to obtain lady zhen posthumous honoursedit cao pi died in  and was succeeded by cao rui who became the second ruler of cao wei cao rui granted his mother the posthumous title empress wenzhao which literally means cultured and diligent empress lady zhens family and relatives also received noble titles the historical text han jin chunqiu mentioned that cao rui had all along been aware of his mothers fate and he was angry and sad about it after he became emperor his stepmother guo nüwang became the empress dowager when he asked her about how his mother died guo replied the late emperor was the one who ordered her death so why are you asking me youre your fathers son so you can blame your dead father are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother cao rui turned furious and forced empress dowager guo to commit suicide he had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress but also ordered her dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother – hair covering face mouth stuffed with rice husks however the historical text weilüe stated that after empress dowager guo died of illness in  cao pis concubine lady li  told cao rui about the fate of his mother cao rui was deeply grieved and he ordered guos dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother reliability of alternative historical sources on lady zhens lifeedit the authoritative historical source on lady zhens life is the records of the three kingdoms sanguozhi which was written by chen shou in the third century in the fifth century pei songzhi annotated the sanguozhi by incorporating information from other texts and adding his personal commentary some sources used in the annotations include wei shu book of wei by wang chen xun yi and ruan ji weilüe brief history of wei by yu huan the original version of lady zhens biography in the sanguozhi did not contain the anecdotes about zhens excellent moral conduct such as her care for her family members her filial piety towards her motherinlaw lady bian her tolerance of cao pis other wives etc these accounts which were mostly documented in the wei shu and the weilüe were later added to the sanguozhi by pei songzhi in his commentary pei cast doubts on the anecdotes relating to the virtuous deeds of lady zhen and other noble ladies of wei because it was difficult to verify whether they were true or not due to a dearth of alternative sources the wei shu and the weilüe were among the official histories of wei so they were likely to be biased towards lady zhen hence some of those anecdotes might have been fabricated by wei historians to promote a positive image of lady zhen pei remarked that chen shou had done well in omitting the questionable information when he first compiled the sanguozhi personal nameedit lady zhens personal name was not recorded in any surviving historical text all nearcontemporary sources such as chen shous sanguozhi and xi zuochis han jin chunqiu refer to her as lady zhen  madam zhen  empress zhen  or simply the empress  the attachment of the names fu  fú and luo  luò to lady zhen came about due to the legend of a romance between her and cao zhi which robert joe cutter a specialist in research on cao zhi concludes to be a piece of anecdotal fiction inspired by the luo shen fu 神賦 rhapsody on the goddess of the luo and taking advantage of the possibilities inherent in a triangle involving a beautiful lady an emperor and his romanticised brother a tradition dating back to at least as far as an undated anonymous note edited into the tang dynasty writer li shans annotated wen xuan had cao zhi meeting the ghost of the recently deceased empress zhen and writing a poem originally titled gan zhen fu  rhapsody on being moved by lady zhen afterwards cao rui found this poem about his uncles love for his mother and changed the title to luo shen fu 神賦 which could be translated as rhapsody on the goddess of the luo or rhapsody on the divine luo this second interpretation presumably referencing lady zhens personal name luo if true this would be a forename unique to early china as the chinese character  has been a toponym since it entered the language the poem contains references to the spirit of the luo river named consort fu 妃 interpreted as a proxy for empress zhen by those who believed in cao zhis infatuation with her this interpretation becomes less allusive if empress zhens personal name was actually fu in popular cultureedit lady zhen is featured as a playable character in koeis dynasty warriors and warriors orochi video game series she is referred to as zhen ji literally means consort zhen or lady zhen in chinese in the games though like every female character in the franchise her name will be written zhenji from dynasty warriors next and warriors orochi  onward miu kamfung portrayed zhen fu lady zhen in the  hong kong television series god of river lok produced by tvb which features the romance between lady zhen and cao zhi in  tvb produced a similar television series titled where the legend begins starring ada choi as lady zhen there is also a  chinese television series legend of goddess luo 新神 produced by huace film and tv starring li yixiao as lady zhen see

lady zhen did not enjoy playing once when she was eight years old her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horseriding performers outside their house but lady zhen did not join in her sisters were puzzled so they asked her and she responded is this something a girl should watch when she was nine years old she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers writing materials her brothers told her you should be learning what women traditionally do such as weaving when you picked up reading were you thinking of becoming a female academician lady zhen replied i heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them if they didnt read how did they learn all that towards the end of the eastern han dynasty after the death of emperor ling china entered a chaotic period because the central governments authority weakened and regional officials and warlords started fighting each other in a bid to gain supremacy the common people suffered from poverty and hunger and many wealthy households who owned expensive items such as jewellery offered to sell these valuables in return for food lady zhens family had large stockpiles of grain and they planned to take advantage of the situation to sell their grain in exchange for valuable items lady zhen who about  years old at the time said to her mother its not wrong to own expensive items but in this chaotic era owning such items has become a wrongdoing our neighbours are suffering from hunger so why dont we distribute our surplus grain to our fellow townsfolk this is an act of graciousness and kindness her family praised her for her suggestion and heeded her advice when lady zhen was  her second brother zhen yan  died and she was deeply grieved she continued to show respect towards zhen yans widow and even helped to raise zhen yans son lady zhens mother was particularly strict towards her daughtersinlaw and treated them harshly lady zhen told her mother its unfortunate that second brother died early second sisterinlaw became widowed at such a young age and shes now left with only her son you should treat your daughtersinlaw better and love them as you would love your own daughters lady zhens mother was so deeply touched that she cried and she started treating her daughtersinlaw better and allowed them to accompany and wait on her marriages to yuan xi and cao piedit sometime in the middle of the jianan era – of the reign of emperor xian lady zhen married yuan xi the second son of yuan shao a warlord who controlled much of northern china yuan shao later put yuan xi in charge of you province so yuan xi left to assume his appointment lady zhen did not follow her husband and remained in ye in presentday handan hebei the administrative centre of yuan shaos domain to take care of her motherinlaw yuan shao lost to his rival cao cao at the battle of guandu in  ce and died two years later after his death his sons yuan tan and yuan shang became embroiled in internecine struggles over their fathers vast domain when the yuan brothers were exhausted from their wars against each other cao cao attacked and defeated them swiftly conquering the territories that used to be controlled by the yuans in  cao cao defeated yuan shang at the battle of ye and his forces occupied the city cao caos son cao pi entered yuan shaos residence and met lady liu yuan shaos widow and lady zhen lady zhen was so terrified that she buried her face in her motherinlaws lap cao pi said whats going on madam liu ask that lady to lift up her head cao pi was very impressed and entranced by lady zhens beauty when he saw her his father allowed him to marry her later another account of this incident stated that lady liu and lady zhen were in yuan shangs residence when cao pi entered lady zhens hair was dishevelled and she was crying behind her motherinlaw when cao pi asked lady liu told him the woman behind her was yuan xis wife cao pi was so entranced by lady zhens beauty that he married her and treated her well yuan xi was still alive at the time yuan shang came to join him after his defeat by cao cao in  cao cao defeated yuan xi yuan shang and their wuhuan allies at the battle of white wolf mountain after which they fled to liaodong to join the warlord gongsun kang gongsun kang feared that they would become a threat to him so he lured them into a trap executed them and sent their heads to cao cao as cao pis wifeedit lady zhen bore cao pi a son and a daughter their son cao rui later became the second emperor of the state of cao wei in the three kingdoms period their daughter whose personal name was not recorded in history was referred to as princess dongxiang  literally princess of the east district in historical records lady zhen remained humble even though cao pi deeply fancied her she provided encouragement to cao pis other wives who were also adored by him and comforted those whom he less favoured she also often urged cao pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants citing the example of the mythical yellow emperor cao pi was very pleased once cao pi wanted to send lady ren  one of his concubines who fell out favour with him back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her when lady zhen heard about it she told her husband lady ren comes from a reputable clan i cant match her in terms of moral character and looks why do you want to send her away cao pi replied she is unruly impulsive and disobedient she has made me angry many times before im sending her away lady zhen wept and pleaded with her husband everyone knows that you love and adore me and theyll think that youre sending lady ren away because of me i fear that ill be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me please consider your decision again carefully cao pi ignored her and sent lady ren away in  cao cao embarked on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by ma chao and han sui leading to the battle of tong pass and the subsequent battles cao caos wife lady bian followed her husband and stayed at meng ford  presentday mengjin county henan while cao pi remained in ye in presentday handan hebei lady bian fell ill during that time lady zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night she constantly sent messengers to inquire her motherinlaws condition but refused to believe them when they reported that lady bian was getting better and she became filled with greater anxiety lady bian later wrote a letter to her telling her that she had fully recovered and only then did lady zhens worries disappear about a year later when lady bian returned to ye lady zhen rushed to see her motherinlaw and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them lady bian assured lady zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety in  cao cao launched another campaign to attack the southeastern warlord sun quan leading to the battle of ruxu in  lady bian cao pi cao rui and princess dongxiang all followed cao cao on the campaign but lady zhen remained in ye because she was sick when cao pi and lady zhens children returned to ye in late  after the campaign lady bians attendants were surprised to see that lady zhen was very cheerful they asked lady youve not seen your children for about a year we thought you would miss them and be worried about them but yet youre so optimistic why is that so lady zhen laughed and replied why should i be worried when cao rui and the others are with madam lady bian deathedit after cao cao died in early  his vassal king title – king of wei  – was inherited by cao pi later that year cao pi forced emperor xian whom he paid nominal allegiance to to abdicate in his favour effectively ending the han dynasty cao pi became the emperor and established the state of cao wei which marked the beginning of the three kingdoms period the dethroned emperor xian was reduced to the status of a duke – the duke of shanyang  the former emperor presented his two daughters to cao pi to be his concubines cao pi began to favour his other concubines especially guo nüwang when lady zhen realised that cao pi favoured her less she started complaining cao pi was furious when he heard about it in the sixth lunar month of  he sent an emissary to ye in presentday handan hebei to force lady zhen to commit suicide lady zhen was buried in ye after her death lady zhens downfall was due to guo nüwang whom cao pi fancied one year after lady zhens death cao pi instated guo as the empress despite opposition from an official zhan qian  the historical text han jin chunqiu  mentioned that lady zhens body was desecrated after her death – her face was covered by her hair and rice husks were stuffed into her mouth cao rui was raised by guo nüwang after lady zhens death alternative account of lady zhens deathedit the wei shu  mentioned that cao pi issued an edict to lady zhen asking her to move to the newly constructed changqiu palace 秋宮 in luoyang lady zhen declined humbly stating that she felt that she was not capable enough to manage the imperial harem and also because she was ill cao pi then consecutively sent another two edicts but lady zhen rejected both it was around summer at the time cao pi intended to fetch lady zhen from ye to luoyang in autumn when the weather was cooler however lady zhen died of illness in ye a few months later cao pi mourned her death and posthumously elevated her to the status of an empress pei songzhi who added the wei shu account to lady zhens biography in the sanguozhi found the account dubious he believed that there were specific reasons as to why cao pi did not instate lady zhen as the empress after he became the emperor and why he forced her to commit suicide he suspected that lady zhen had probably committed an offence which was not recorded in the official histories of the cao wei state alternative theories on lady zhens deathedit many popular stories speculated that the reason for lady zhens death was that she had a secret affair with cao pis younger brother cao zhi even though this speculation is not supported by evidence and is improbable some more fantastical accounts alleged that she had an affair with cao cao as well one example of this can be found in the a new account of the tales of the world in which cao cao started the battle of ye in  to obtain lady zhen posthumous honoursedit cao pi died in  and was succeeded by cao rui who became the second ruler of cao wei cao rui granted his mother the posthumous title empress wenzhao which literally means cultured and diligent empress lady zhens family and relatives also received noble titles the historical text han jin chunqiu mentioned that cao rui had all along been aware of his mothers fate and he was angry and sad about it after he became emperor his stepmother guo nüwang became the empress dowager when he asked her about how his mother died guo replied the late emperor was the one who ordered her death so why are you asking me youre your fathers son so you can blame your dead father are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother cao rui turned furious and forced empress dowager guo to commit suicide he had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress but also ordered her dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother – hair covering face mouth stuffed with rice husks however the historical text weilüe stated that after empress dowager guo died of illness in  cao pis concubine lady li  told cao rui about the fate of his mother cao rui was deeply grieved and he ordered guos dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother reliability of alternative historical sources on lady zhens lifeedit the authoritative historical source on lady zhens life is the records of the three kingdoms sanguozhi which was written by chen shou in the third century in the fifth century pei songzhi annotated the sanguozhi by incorporating information from other texts and adding his personal commentary some sources used in the annotations include wei shu book of wei by wang chen xun yi and ruan ji weilüe brief history of wei by yu huan the original version of lady zhens biography in the sanguozhi did not contain the anecdotes about zhens excellent moral conduct such as her care for her family members her filial piety towards her motherinlaw lady bian her tolerance of cao pis other wives etc these accounts which were mostly documented in the wei shu and the weilüe were later added to the sanguozhi by pei songzhi in his commentary pei cast doubts on the anecdotes relating to the virtuous deeds of lady zhen and other noble ladies of wei because it was difficult to verify whether they were true or not due to a dearth of alternative sources the wei shu and the weilüe were among the official histories of wei so they were likely to be biased towards lady zhen hence some of those anecdotes might have been fabricated by wei historians to promote a positive image of lady zhen pei remarked that chen shou had done well in omitting the questionable information when he first compiled the sanguozhi personal nameedit lady zhens personal name was not recorded in any surviving historical text all nearcontemporary sources such as chen shous sanguozhi and xi zuochis han jin chunqiu refer to her as lady zhen  madam zhen  empress zhen  or simply the empress  the attachment of the names fu  fú and luo  luò to lady zhen came about due to the legend of a romance between her and cao zhi which robert joe cutter a specialist in research on cao zhi concludes to be a piece of anecdotal fiction inspired by the luo shen fu 神賦 rhapsody on the goddess of the luo and taking advantage of the possibilities inherent in a triangle involving a beautiful lady an emperor and his romanticised brother a tradition dating back to at least as far as an undated anonymous note edited into the tang dynasty writer li shans annotated wen xuan had cao zhi meeting the ghost of the recently deceased empress zhen and writing a poem originally titled gan zhen fu  rhapsody on being moved by lady zhen afterwards cao rui found this poem about his uncles love for his mother and changed the title to luo shen fu 神賦 which could be translated as rhapsody on the goddess of the luo or rhapsody on the divine luo this second interpretation presumably referencing lady zhens personal name luo if true this would be a forename unique to early china as the chinese character  has been a toponym since it entered the language the poem contains references to the spirit of the luo river named consort fu 妃 interpreted as a proxy for empress zhen by those who believed in cao zhis infatuation with her this interpretation becomes less allusive if empress zhens personal name was actually fu in popular cultureedit lady zhen is featured as a playable character in koeis dynasty warriors and warriors orochi video game series she is referred to as zhen ji literally means consort zhen or lady zhen in chinese in the games though like every female character in the franchise her name will be written zhenji from dynasty warriors next and warriors orochi  onward miu kamfung portrayed zhen fu lady zhen in the  hong kong television series god of river lok produced by tvb which features the romance between lady zhen and cao zhi in  tvb produced a similar television series titled where the legend begins starring ada choi as lady zhen there is also a  chinese television series legend of goddess luo 新神 produced by huace film and tv starring li yixiao as lady zhen see
