the financing enables allena to advance alln its lead program for the treatment of hyperoxaluria into phase  development “the positive response and level of interest we have received from investors is

is a serious metabolic condition resulting from high oxalate levels in the urine due to either hyperabsorption of oxalate from the diet secondary hyperoxaluria or from overproduction of oxalate by the liver due to a hereditary enzyme deficiency primary hyperoxaluria hyperoxaluria can initially cause the development of kidney stones and can lead to nephrocalcinosis and oxalate nephropathy that leads to chronic kidney disease ckd endstage renal disease esrd and dialysis secondary hyperoxaluria often leads to recurrent and frequent kidney stone episodes kidney stones are also associated with a twofold higher risk of ckd and esrd and a higher risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as stroke the risk for kidney stones increases with elevated levels of oxalate excretion and the prevalence of hyperoxaluria is greater in patients with intestinal disease or malabsorption of nutrients kidney stones are painful debilitating and result in significant social and financial burden leading to significant impairment in quality of life qol there are approximately  million emergency room visits approximately  percent of all visits and  million office visits annually for kidney stones in  approximately  percent of people with emergency department discharges had more than two admissions for kidney stones primary hyperoxaluria ph is a rare inherited disorder affecting the liver that leads to markedly elevated levels of oxalate in plasma and urine hyperoxaluria causes kidney stone formation and accumulation of oxalate in tissues as well as calcification of the kidney ultimately leading to kidney failure and premature death patients with primary hyperoxaluria typically present with kidney stones anywhere from birth to their mids among patients with primary hyperoxaluria about  percent will have kidney failure by age  and about  percent will have kidney failure by age  ph affects approximately  patients worldwide about alln allena’s lead program alln is
