iijames edington idaniel rodgers linksthe storytellersnewspaper cuttingscourt case  welcome to my genealogy pages‎  ‎ellis families‎  ‎ george ellis    of heathfield sussex in england of meadows and hyde park in south australia george ellis is my great great grandfather i am given to understand george ellis was born in heathfield sussex england on  september  the son of george ellis  and elizabeth knight aft  i am now not convinced as to this date of birth as in florence smith nee ellis his grand daughters birthday book his birthday is given as  june  if this is the correct george he was christened on  october  in the independent nonconformist church in heathfield near horsham sussex  however my recent research suggests this may not be the case as this family has a george who appears in the  census and as our george cant be in two places at opposite sides of the world at the same time george did however emigrate on  october  from london england via the downs aboard the rajasthan a masted ship of  tons captained by captain duncan ritchie arriving at port adelaide south australia on  february    unfortunately as far as i am aware there is not a complete passenger listing available for this arrival of the rajasthan  the ship then went on to port phillip and bombay  the rajasthan was accompanied by the java and a diary by james trangmar a passenger on the infamous java voyage provides some insight as to the likely conditions george might have experienced on his voyage  the richards family diary from the java also mentions the rajasthan racing to port adelaide george ellis taken at the old colonists dinner adelaide sa december  arrived “rajasthan”  from south australian archives the adelaide register of  february  notes the arrival of the rajasthan in the weekly report of vessels in the harbour with a description of her cargo there is also mention in the same paper of a dinner attended by a number of the most respectable passengers newly arrived on the rajasthan and those who had arrived on her earlier voyage which george would most likely have attended   on  june  george aged  labourer and a bachelor married sophia ransom maidment aged  a spinster in the macclesfield chapel macclesfield south australia  the officiating clergy was rev john baptist austin and witnesses were e c maidment edwin charles maidment brother of sophia elizabeth gloag uncertain of spelling and unclear as to her relationship to the couple and sarah ann maidment nee hogben and sisterinlaw married to brother edwin charles maidment george and sophia were married on the same day and place as her sister harriet maidment married john william wheeler sophia ransom maidment was born in westbury wiltshire england on  october  the daughter of charles maidment  and esther fanny doel  she was christened on  may  in the old independent church westbury wiltshire in these church records her name is registered as sophia rauson maidment she emigrated with her parents and siblings aboard the charles kerr arriving in adelaide  south australia on  june  according to the south australian archives the hodge index  application for passage        sophia is listed with father charles maidment aged  mother and  male chn aged yrswks and  females aged    and  yrs prior to arriving in australia sophia lived with her family in westbury in wiltshire england at the time of her marriage in  the maidment family were living at bugles ranges near macclesfield bruce marshall a maidment relative has a copy of the marriage certificate of w j maidment and hannah rogers who were married on  february   also by the rev j b austin they were married at the private dwelling of mr maidment senr at bugle ranges near macclesfield and the witnesses were george ellis brotherinlaw wwilliam hogben brotherinlaw sarah a maidment sisterinlaw william joseph maidment was sophias brother and sarah maidment nee hogben was married to another of sophias brothers charles edwin  william hogben was married to elizabeth burnbridge maidment sophia sister together george and sophia had the following named children ellen  william  charles  my great grandfather george  benjamin  edwin  fanny  frederick  emily  mary  and louie or louey i understand there was another unnamed stillborn son born but do not know when or where he was born date unknown possibly c possible identities top row fred b  went to qld c edwin b benjamin b  george b middle row fanny b  sophia george william b ellen b bottom row emily b mary b louie b from gerald brown i think  charles  b is not in picture   he married in  and an early picture doesn look like a match then doesnt seem a likely suspect  charles was in moonta  then in victoria  onwards     georges occupation in a number of later records is recorded as a butcher farmer and storekeeper in meadows    this photo from hazel alexander nee ellis granddaughter of charles ellis was inscribed uncle wm ellis shop meadows sa dads brother
