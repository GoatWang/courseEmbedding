idgaccel raises b for china riding buzz from facebook and ipos  venturebeat   by matt marshall idgaccel raises b for china riding buzz from facebook and ipos matt marshall april    pm idgaccel a joint venture between media giant idg and venture capital firm accel partners has finished raising two new china funds totaling  billion the warchest is significantly larger than the joint venture has raised in the past because china’s market is on fire said an idgaccel partner hugo shong in an interview there are more than  million users of the internet in china now up from just  million such users in  when the joint venture first started investing in china not only are the internet digital media ecommerce and mobile markets growing quickly but so are other areas such as healthcare and cleantech he said we’ve known about the fundraising for some time but the announcement confirms the amount we’re hearing accel plans to announce yet another fund likely for its us activities the idgaccel china funds are as follows a  million fund for earlystage and fastgrowing companies called the idgaccel china growth fund iii and a  million fund for later stage and preipo investments called china capital fund ii idg a media firm that has invested in china since the early s has benefited from its early presence in china bolstering its reputation after investing in big deals such as baidu tencent ctrip and dangdang dangdang alone is rumored to have returned at least  million to idg and accel the first venture firm to invest serious capital into facebook brings its silicon valley expertise to the table shong noted the coincidental growth of the idgaccel fund sizes to match the growth — almost exactly — of the number of internet users in china in  the first idgaccel fund was only  million back when the number of internet users was  million the steadily rising fund sizes in china contrast with a tapering off or even decline of fund sizes in the united states the idgaccel alliance has seen seven of its portfolio companies file to go public or get acquired so far han ting andon health kang hui rda golden sun changan and soufun but the ipos only listed over the past year and so insider “lock up” agreements prevent idgaccel from cashing in its investments until later this year things are going so well shong said that the joint venture expects to see seven to ten more
