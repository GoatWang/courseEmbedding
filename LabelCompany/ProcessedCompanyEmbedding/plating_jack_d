“jack” horner a wellknown expert in the metal finishing industry passed away in march but not before leaving behind a legacy for all those he helped or those who had the opportunity to work with him to solve finishing problems as technical director of allied kelite horner wrote many training modules and was responsible for authoring the technical service modules on copper plating zinc plating and bright nickel plating after graduating from michigan technical university in  horner began working in metal finishing and became known in the industry as “the platers’ pal” since he always wanted to help customers be successful but he also had a strong desire to understand the nuts and bolts of the technology he worked in process control and process engineering in production plating shops and later joined the supplier side with wagner brothers soon that evolved into richardson chemical allied kelite and then witco in his career he spent time in technical service and research and product development in the management of various projects and teams horner’s areas of expertise included many metal finishing disciplines but his focus and passion included surface preparation sulfamate nickel plating copper plating and both electrolytic and electroless nickel plating he was involved in the design and fabrication of the nickel plated reflector for the hubble telescope and was also directly involved in deriving the practical application of manufacturing procedures using nickel metal powder and sulfamic acid demonstrating the importance of the selection of raw materials and the implementation for the barrett nickel sulfamate technologies concentrates and additives he published many internal and external documents about the nickel topic over his career horner’s passion was presenting at many local nasf chapters topics such as “the trouble with anodes” or training type modules on surface preparation or general troubleshooting approaches he also presented topics at the national surface finishing expositions as early as  such as “the study and effects of some variables on the speed and distribution of deposits from cyanide copper plating solutions” he continued to present important topics and at the surfin  exposition he revealed “properties of electroless nickel deposits – specifying and measuring problems” which was a collection of experiences over  years covering deposit internal stress deposit hardness and neutral salt spray interactions for electroless nickel technology horner was very active in the astm b committee for much of his mid and later career which is responsible for metallic and inorganic coatings for the industry today this committee has jurisdiction over  standards published in the annual book of astm standards volume  and horner’s imprint can be found on many of the standards published today in october  he received from astm the prestigious lowenheim award for his contributions and service to the b committee throughout his astm career horner headed up several sub committees as chairperson and also through his involvement as a member of many other committees as recently as four or five years ago since his retirement he did consulting on a limited basis most recently for the nickel institute in the area of nickel electroplating and nickel electroforming one of his accomplishments where he took a leadership role was related to the astm b specification where he coordinated round robin testing for developing the precision and bias sections that were becoming required for all technical documents the publication authored by horner was “microhardness testing of plating coatings recent round robin experiences” which ended up in astm’s special technical publication  in  subsequent work was also published in astm stp modules with the information still being viable today a very high honor awarded to horner was when he wrote the first version of the chapter on “electroplating” in the kirkothmer encyclopedia of chemical technology th edition volume  in  published by john wiley and sons in  this was adapted for the online version over his career horner made a tremendous contribution to the plating industry on which current engineers can continue to benefit he was known to be persistent for getting to the truth about strengths and weaknesses regarding technologies he fought many battles for the benefit of the plater horner’s colleagues say he will certainly be missed and as one friend said “a giant has left the room” editor pick hubbardhall newest team members bring engineering marketing expertise
