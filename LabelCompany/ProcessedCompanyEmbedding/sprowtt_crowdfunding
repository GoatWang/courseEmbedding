entrepreneurs share at least one thing in common they need funding to turn their ideas into a business crowdfunding campaigns and investorseeking tv shows are part of the growing momentum towards creating these mutually beneficial arrangements the ultimate goal is to allow investors be part of something that ultimately makes them money and startups get access to the resources and funding that they desperately need on the downside there are many compliance issues and legalities that come into play the deals made on tv shows like shark tank and the profit don’t always pan out as shown onscreen and nothing is official until the contracts are signed crowdfunding websites are notoriously expensive to use and pose legal risks to both the fundraising parties and the investorsfunders many have run into trouble when it comes to defining their terms and processes such as donations vs revenue and pledges vs commitments sprowtt a financial technology company with a solid background of
