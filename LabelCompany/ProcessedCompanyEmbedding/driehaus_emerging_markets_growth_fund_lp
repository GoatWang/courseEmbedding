principal risks all investments including those in mutual funds have risks no investment is suitable for all investors the fund is intended for longterm investors who can accept the risks involved in investing in foreign securities of course there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its objective you may lose money by investing in the fund below are the main risks of investing in the fund market risk the fund is subject to market risk which is the possibility that stock prices overall will decline over short or long periods stock markets tend to move in cycles with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices these fluctuations are expected to have a substantial influence on the value of the fund’s shares growth stock risk growth stocks are typically priced higher than other stocks in relation to earnings and other measures because investors believe they have more growth potential this potential may or may not be realized and if it is not realized may result in a loss to the fund growth stock prices also tend to be more volatile than the overall market foreign securities and currencies risk the fund invests in foreign securities investing outside the us involves different risks than domestic investments the following risks may be associated with foreign investments less liquidity greater volatility political instability restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of capital less complete and reliable information about foreign companies reduced government supervision of some foreign securities markets lower responsiveness of foreign management to shareholder concerns economic issues or developments in foreign countries fluctuation in exchange rates of foreign currencies and risks of devaluation imposition of foreign withholding and other taxes dependence of emerging market companies upon commodities which may be subject to economic cycles and emerging market risk such as limited trading volume expropriation devaluation or other adverse political or social developments to the extent portfolio securities are issued by foreign issuers or denominated in foreign currencies the fund’s investment performance is affected by the strength or weakness of the us dollar against these currencies generally an increase in the value of the us dollar against a foreign currency will reduce the value of a security denominated in that foreign currency thereby decreasing the fund’s overall net asset value currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short or long periods of time for a number of reasons including changes in interest rates imposition of currency controls and economic or political developments in the us or abroad emerging market risk the fund invests primarily in emerging markets and therefore the risks described above for foreign securities are typically increased investments in securities of issuers located in such countries are speculative and subject to certain special risks the small size limited trading volume and relative inexperience of the securities markets in these countries may make the fund’s investments in such countries illiquid and more volatile than investments in more developed countries and the fund may be required to establish special custodial or other arrangements before making investments in these countries there may be little financial or accounting information available with respect to issuers located in these countries and it may be difficult as a result to assess the value or prospects of an investment in such issuers small and mediumsized company risk the fund invests in companies that are smaller less established with less liquid markets for their stock and therefore may be riskier investments while small and mediumsized companies generally have the potential for rapid growth the securities of these companies often involve greater risks than investments in larger more established companies because small and mediumsized companies may lack the management experience financial resources product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies in addition in many instances the securities of small and mediumsized companies are traded only overthecounter or on a regional securities exchange and the frequency and volume of their trading is substantially less than is typical of larger companies the value of securities of smaller less well known issuers can be more volatile than that of larger issuers allocation risk the fund’s overall risk level will depend on the countries and market sectors in which the fund is invested because the fund may have significant weightings in a particular company country industry or market sector the value of fund shares may be affected by events that adversely affect that company country industry or market sector and may fluctuate more than that of a less focused fund high rates of turnover it is anticipated that the fund will experience high rates of portfolio turnover which may result in payment by the fund of aboveaverage transaction costs and could result in the payment by shareholders of taxes on aboveaverage amounts of realized investment gains including net shortterm capital gains which are taxed as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes manager risk how the fund’s investment adviser manages the fund will impact the fund’s performance the fund may lose money if the investment adviser’s investment strategy does not achieve the fund’s objective or the investment adviser does not implement the strategy
