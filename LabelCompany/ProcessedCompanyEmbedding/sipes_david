utilities manager bob sipes  david foster on oil and water july  0 by james dissette the simple fact is after three decades oil still exists underground at the chestertown hospital site formerly kent and queen anne’s hospital the medical center became  an affiliate of the university of maryland medical system and then a partner along with easton’s hospital as part of umvshore regional health the town’s water supply aquifer lies  feet downhill from the closest part of the oil site so far no traces of oil have appeared in the town aquifer however if migration of the oil does come near to the town’s water aquifer it could signal a well closure along with millions of dollars to set up a new water infrastructure along with a constellation of problems from health to property values the protection of the town’s water from oil migration since it was discovered in the late s has been done using a “pump and treat” system of monitoring and recovery wells on the site considered a successful safeguard um shore regional health pays 0 a year to keep them running in 0 they hired consultants to explore solutions that would clean the site and allow discontinuation of the pump systems but how much oil is left that’s where the complexity begins robert sipes has been monitoring the problem since the beginning of his year tenure as the town utilities manager for chestertown using original estimates for the oil spill—0 gallons—sipes calls attention to epas own determination that “pump and treat” systems like the ones we have been using are only  efficient for oil retrieval university of maryland shore health consultants claim that the pumps have cleaned  gallons of oil from the site to date by any math there is an excess of oil left possibly between  and 0 some in hardcaked form still at the site new solutions have been sought to deal with the rest in the fall of 0 the maryland department of environment mde approved a pilot test using a soapbased product ivysol to be injected into the site to test the process for its efficiency the solvent is designed to free the compounded oil so that it can be recovered mde considers the test to be “promising” and while sipes agrees he feels that additional safeguards should be implemented including a site characterization plan to determine where and what levels the remaining oil is and the inclusion of testing for other chemical compounds that have been detected in the area he warns that simply testing a clean monitoring site after using ivysol will not be an accurate indication of oil remediation for the total area in their interview with the spy sipes along with former epa policy analyst david foster talk about the current state of the remediation process in light of mde’s open meeting next tuesday july th  pm at town hall mde will be announcing and discussing their remediation plan at this meeting filed under homepage highlights ← july pet of the month dyson  bugs by george merrill → letters to editor dan menefee says july 0 0 at 0 pm job well done on this story i hope people take the time to see the whole video there are some important statements towards the end by david foster not mentioned in the video are the concerns of the former mde official who supervised remediation of the site for  years his comments in a story last year are note worthy as he has extensive scientific knowledge of this site his comments are crucial and helpful to inform citizens about the history and science of this very complicated issue before we move forward with more injections these were his comments last year fred keer says april 0 0 at  pm the purpose of these comments is to clarify issues about the site and help promote a meaningful discussion of future remediation steps proposed for the site factual information concerning this site has always been available in the public record since discovery of the accidental release the specific details of the release could not be determined due to inaccessibility of portions of the system a in excess of 0 gallons of number  fuel oil free product have been extracted from the site b as a general rule no more than  of subsurface petroleum can be extracted utilizing primary recovery methods ground waterwater table skimming therefore a reasonable working estimate of the original release would be 0 gallons of fuel oil released to the subsurface the actual amount could be higher or lower c the town wellfieldwater supply contains multiple shallow wells d the town well closest to the release site is known to influence the contamination plume as a proactive measure this well was shut down years ago to help prevent migration of the contamination plume down dip towards the multiple town wellfieldwater supply e the dissolved phase contamination plume historically migrated down dipgradient approximately to the edge of campus avenue f the free phase plume historically migrated down dipgradient to just below brown street g the hospital site lies within the ground water protection area determined for the town wellfield h the town wellfield is installed in a paleo stream channel old stream channel which trends parallel to philosophers terrace up gradient towards the hospital site this stream channel is a permeable preferential pathway i the hospitalcontamination site sits on or near the locality of the headwaters of the paleo stream channel no future remediation proposals should be considered for approval without first developing and explaining the site conceptual model postulated for the site development of a site conceptual model is standard procedure for all remediation sites this model must contain the following facts and postulates  a map view of the site annotating all possible source areas and all possible receptor areas for this site the general source area is the underground storage tank locality and associated contamination plume the primary receptor of concern is the town wellfieldwater supply  several strike and dip cross sections depicting the detailed stratigraphy constructed from detailed core data of the source area including both free phase and dissolved phase contamination plume  several strike and dip cross sections depicting the town water supplywellfield including well depths and screenedopen hole intervals  cross sections traversing the hospital site and town wellfieldwater supply depicting postulated preferential pathways between the two the site conceptual model must be the framework for discussing all future remediation proposals and should be refined as new information becomes available sufficient detailed core data may not be available to refine the existing site conceptual model and evaluate the site for fluidchemical injection remediation procedures an accurate estimate of the remaining contamination should be made utilizing core data as well as dissolved groundwater chemical data prior to permittingapproving any form of subsurface injection of fluidschemicals detailed crosssections of injection well stratigraphy and recovery well stratigraphy must be constructed injection wells should be designed and constructed for the purpose of injection of fluids into specific formations chemical makeup of injection fluids must be known and divulged “proprietary information” should not be accepted as an excuse to withhold information a robust recovery system and monitoring plan chemical data and physical data must be developed to recover and document all injection and recovery of fluids no fluids should be injected without knowing the pathways between injection and recovery wells and monitor wells these pathways must be determined utilizing detailed core data in order to be legitimate the monitor well circuit must be separate from the injectionrecovery well circuit contamination free phase product and dissolved constituent exists under the hospital building and for all practical purposes remains inaccessible but mobile this contamination will continue to be a source area the purpose of injection of surfactants into formations is to mobilize immiscible fluids in this case free phase number  heating oil as a contaminant trappedpartially trapped within the formation these mobilized fluidscontaminants will move with the artificially established hydraulic gradient andor natural hydraulic gradient over time the natural hydraulic gradient is towards the town wellfieldwater supply once artificial hydraulic control ceases the natural gradient will control the migration of contaminants given the fact that the contamination plume has been documented to endanger the town’s wellfieldwater supply this site seems to be a questionable choice to utilize andor experiment with known or unknown surfactant fluid injection remediation procedures remediation of groundwater petroleum contaminated sites is a difficult demanding complicated and expensive undertaking in my opinion and as is documented in the public record the efforts put forth by the responsible party to date have been effective although information put forth to the public could have been better this is not an easy site to remediate concerning the costs and potential impacts it is not an easy site to close out patti willis says july 0 0 at 0 pm factual corrections  while unrecorded at the time the original oil leak in  was estimated to be  gallons based upon the size of the tank and the amount of refueling which had been done prior to the leak of the  gallons approximately  gallons have been recovered  the actual annual cost of operating gauging and sampling the pump and treat system is 0 every year david foster says july 0 0 at 0 pm although obviously no one was measuring the oil as it leaked out let me explain precisely why we believe it was well in excess of  gallons a figure that has never been verified by mde  first epa models suggest that traditional pump and treat systems such as those employed on this site normally remove only about  of the oil spilled from a leaking underground storage tank  second the hospital and its consultants claim to have already removed  gallons  therefore if  represents  of the original oil in the ground then the original amount must have been approximately  x  gallons or 0 gallons  furthermore if 0 gallons were originally spilled and  of those gallons have now been removed then there must be approximately  gallons still remaining under the ground and just up the hill from chestertown’s only drinking water supply as this one example raised by ms willis communications director for shore regional health indicates there is still tremendous uncertainty regarding the quantity of the oil as well as the precise location and mobility of that oil the subsoil that lies under the ground just downhill from the hospital can be described as resembling a marble cake only the dark places in that “cake” are not chocolate but sand and gravel now coated with oil and no one can be certain precisely where those pockets of oil remain unfortunately with this uncertainty comes risk and the real question is who should bear the burden of that risk finally whether the annual cost of the pump and treat system currently employed is actually 0 rather than the  we originally heard this is still a very small price compared to the millions of dollars it may cost to replace our wells plus the potential adverse impact on property values in chestertown nonetheless we welcome the new information and we look forward to reviewing the supporting data for that cost estimate data that has been repeatedly requested by the citizens of chestertown fred keer says july  0 at 0 pm factual correction when the spill was discovered the estimete was in the  to 0 gallon range nothing more than a guess initial spill estimates are notoriously wrong and almost always grossly understated secondly if the hospital was in posession of a  gallon estimate it was not transmiteed to the mde which would have been considered withholding important information necessary for an effectiive remediation design does the hospital staff want to admit this thirdly the only meaningful method to determine the amount of a subserface spill is to install sufficient appropriatley screened mononitor wells record recovery amounts and apply knowledge of the type of recovery system installed no credable hydrogeologist would claim at best moree than a  percent recovery rate for a pump and treat skimming system finally as noted above the  gallon estimate was not recorded
