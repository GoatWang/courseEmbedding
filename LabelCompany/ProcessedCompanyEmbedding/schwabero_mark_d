our first quarter results as well as provide insights into the global marine markets bill will elaborate on our financial performance including comments pertaining to our segments as well as the pl and cash flow expectations i will then wrap up with our current  full year outlook so the marine market is off to a solid start in  and is performing consistent with our expectations our emphasis is on product leadership and the market share gains and this positions us to perform well in a growing marine market our fitness business continues to successfully execute against its integration and transformation plans which in  include new product introductions changes to the manufacturing footprint and further cost realignment actions the benefits of these activities will begin to favorably impact the segment growth rates and margin performance in the second half of  as we look to the remainder of  and assess our business opportunities and risk we believe we are well positioned to deliver against our plans for the current year and our  targets first quarter revenue in  increased  with acquisitions contributing approximately  of growth on an overall basis foreign currency had a minimal impact on our top line comparisons our top line reflected strong growth rates in all three of our primary boat categories as well as in our marine parts and accessories fitness and outboard engine businesses while our consolidated top line growth was strong gross margins in the first quarter declined and were below our expectations the majority of decline resulted from unfavorable changes in sales mix within the fitness and boat segments as well as from changes in mix between segments performance in the engine segment was strong bill will highlight some additional factors influencing gross margins as he reviews our segment performance adjusted pretax earnings increased by  while diluted eps as adjusted of  was up  or  included in this amount is the  per share net benefit related to sharebased compensation activity which bill will also cover in his remarks now i will provide our perspective on the us marine market based on final reporting for  the unit volume for the us powerboat industry as defined by nmma grew  which is a slight upward revision from the  preliminary estimate we had referenced on the january call based upon the preliminary ssi data for the first quarter which on average comprises about  of the year at retail the industry unit volumes grew approximately  outboard boats increased by approximately  while the fiberglass sterndriveinboard declined by  large fiberglass sterndriveinboard boats experienced the fourth consecutive quarter of retail registration declines i would like to comment on the preliminary ssi reporting which is incomplete for q for example the current report reflects only  of the activity in march with several key states excluded this is significant as march normally comprises just under half of the retail activity in the quarter when considering data sources that are based on full reporting for the quarter including our internal retail activity based upon our pipeline data which was up  in the us combined with other data points such as industry outboard registrations and floor plan lending activity we believe that the market growth is strong and that we are outperforming the market consequently we believe the ssi data for the first quarter will likely be revised higher as more states finish their reporting our  plan continues to assume that the us industry unit growth will be similar to the  trends this view is supported by early season trends including our dealer sentiments strong order levels favorable roadshow results new and innovative product offerings across the industry favorable replacement cycle dynamics as existing boats age as well as stable economic conditions and improved consumer sentiments next i would like to review with you our current regional marine market perspectives revenue growth in europe reflected strong retail unit growth in the first quarter of  overall demand was healthy and our performance exceeded the market growth rates additionally our parts and accessories businesses experienced strong growth in europe our plan reflects growth in the european retail boat marketing units to be up low to mid singledigits for the full year  we anticipate our marine revenue will once again grow faster than the market due to our continuing improvements in mix and share gains in canada the retail unit demand in the first quarter improved versus the prior year and provided some early evidence of the anticipated market stabilization for more favorable economic conditions and a relatively stable exchange rate environment the slight decline in wholesale revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our average selling prices due to mix in other rest of world markets our outlook for the asiapacific continues to reflect stable retail demand while latin america africa and the middle east remain difficult markets the engine business continues to pursue targeted share gains through enhancing its distribution and service presence throughout the world with our expanded sea pro branded commercial engines in asia and central america markets in summary we expect the full year  global unit growth to be in the  to  range our revenue growth will continue to outperform through share gains and mix improvements as well as benefit from recently completed acquisitions in our parts and accessories and boat businesses moving to our fitness segment where revenue increased slightly on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions revenue comparisons reflect stable overall demand in global commercial fitness markets including valueoriented franchise clubs in the us as we assess the current us market we believe that clubs are slowing investment as they evaluate alternatives in response to changing exercise preferences while this is creating some shortterm growth challenges it does not change our longterm view of the industry fundamentals the evolving fitness landscape provides us future opportunities with the breadth of our products our technology our brands our sales capabilities and our channel partners we believe we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this environment our plan assumes that our growth rate will improve in the second half as we introduce extensive new cardio product offerings that will benefit both life fitness and cybex in addition we have completed enhancements to our sales force and distribution capabilities and are well positioned to capitalize on these new product introductions now ill turn the call over to bill for additional comments on our financial performance william l metzger thanks mark for the first quarter sales in our combined marine segments and fitness segment increased by  and  respectively from a geographic perspective consolidated us sales increased by  sales outside the us on a constant currency basis increased by  by region sales on a constant currency basis increased by  in europe while rest of the world sales were up  first quarter of  adjusted operating earnings were  million increase of  million or  versus the prior year our adjusted operating margin of  ph was  basis points lower than the prior year turning to our marine engine segment where first quarter sales increased by  from a geographic perspective us were up  reflecting solid growth in outboard engines and parts and accessories partially offset by declines in sterndrive engines european sales were up  on a constant currency basis with gains in parts and accessories and outboard engines this performance reflects our strategy to expand the parts and accessories business in this region rest of the world sales on a constant currency basis were up  compared to the prior year growth was driven by increases in canada and asiapacific partially offset by declines in the africa and middle east region canadian revenue comparisons benefited from the paynes marine acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of  on a product category basis the outboard engine business reported strong sales growth in the quarter particularly in higherhorsepower categories this performance reflects a favorable retail demand environment and continued benefits of share gains in targeted saltwater repower and commercial markets first quarter sterndrive engine sales declined as the demand environment for these engines continues to be affected by the shift to outboards and unfavorable global retail demand trends our market share in the sterndrive engine market remained strong and as some of that market transitions to outboard propulsion we believe that our outboard engine portfolio is very well positioned to capitalize on this transition mercurys parts and accessories businesses delivered strong sales growth during the quarter revenue increases were balanced between our products and distribution businesses and were also balanced from a domestic and international perspective this performance benefited from market share gains a recent acquisition and new product launches as well as the successful execution of our international growth strategy mercurys operating earnings increased by  and operating margins were at   basis points higher than the prior year operating leverage was  improvement in operating earnings and margins reflected benefits from higher sales a favorable shift in sales mix and improved cost efficiencies partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange and planned increases in growthrelated investments in our boat segment first quarter revenues increased by  with strong growth rates in the fiberglass outboard and aluminum boat categories sales of fiberglass sterndriveinboard boats increased in spite of anticipated declines in large fiberglass sterndriveinboard boats the decline in large fiberglass sterndriveinboard boat sales reflects moderating market conditions and the timing of new model introductions along with the impacts of transitioning production between facilities in the first quarter and reaching appropriate stocking levels of product in  in the us which represents  of this segment sales increased  in addition to favorable retail market demand us sales continue to benefit from recently introduced new products and market share gains european sales on a constant currency basis increased by  versus the prior year due to recent product introductions and solid retail growth rest of the world sales on a constant currency basis increased by  reflecting benefits from the thunder jet acquisition and modest improvement in overall wholesale demand in latin america africa and the middle east and canada global retail units for the first quarter increased by  while retail units in the us increased  global wholesale shipments for the first quarter increased  i would like to note that retail and wholesale unit growth rates were relatively balanced in the quarter in the first quarter of  sales growth was driven by increased wholesale unit shipments particularly in our aluminum outboard businesses average selling prices were relatively flat as benefits from continued migration of boats with more content and features was offset by the impact of the previously mentioned sales decline in large fiberglass sterndriveinboard boats along with the successful launch of new valueoriented pontoon products we are planning for increases in average selling prices for the full year but the rate of increase will be lower than  dealer pipeline inventories ended the quarter at  weeks of boats on hand measured on a trailing month retail basis which was in line with prior year levels we believe that our pipeline levels are appropriate given our growth expectations in various boat categories and markets as well as dealer sentiment and outlook for the retail selling season for  we are planning for the weeks of inventory on hand at year end to be consistent with prior yearend levels we are also assuming wholesale and retail unit growth rates will be relatively consistent the boat segments first quarter operating earnings as adjusted declined by  million when compared to the prior year operating margins declined  basis points to  as adjusted it is worth noting that in the first quarter of  operating margins improved by  basis points versus the prior year and operating leverage was  operating margin and earnings comparisons for  reflect favorable performance in the fiberglass outboard boat business which was more than offset by challenges in other categories in our large fiberglass sterndriveinboard boats business results were affected by lower volume and cost absorption as well as unfavorable reserve adjustments including warranty in the aluminum boat business unfavorable changes in sales mix and higher commodity costs affected performance shifting to our fitness segment sales increased by  for the quarter on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions increased by  sales in the us excluding acquisitions were down slightly compared with the prior year reflecting declines in cybex revenues while overall commercial revenue trends were stable international sales were strong led by the benefits of the icg acquisition and growth in asia pacific on an asadjusted basis segment operating earnings declined by  million and operating margins were  which was  basis points lower than the prior year contributions from the icg acquisition along with a benefit of cybex synergies were more than offset by a number of factors these include changes in sales mix as well as planned costs associated with capacity expansions new product introductions and manufacturing facility transitions next i will discuss the impact that foreign currency is having on our performance in the first quarter the sales impact from currency changes was nominal and operating earnings comparisons were negatively affected by approximately  million moving to the full year of  we are anticipating that foreign currency will have a slight unfavorable impact on consolidated sales and operating earnings comparisons versus  these estimates for  assume that foreign exchange rates remain consistent with the current rates for the remainder of the year we recorded restructuring exit and integration charges in the first quarter of  totaling  million these amounts include costs associated with the recently announced closure of our brazilian boat manufacturing facility along with previously planned costs related to the integration of acquisitions and leadership transition in our fitness business for the full year we are planning to incur between  million and  million of restructuring exit and integration charges this increased from our prior year estimate due to the brazilian manufacturing facility closure and incremental costreduction actions that have been initiated in the fitness and boat segments these costs are excluded from our asadjusted earnings guidance mark will address the benefits from these actions in his concluding remarks our yeartodate effective book tax rate as adjusted was  which includes net tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation activity excluding these benefits our asadjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was  which was favorable versus our expectations for the remaining three quarters of the year we are planning for an effective tax rate of approximately  including the sharebased compensation tax benefits recorded in the first quarter the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately  which is reflected in our guidance our full year eps guidance does not include any additional excess tax benefits for the remainder of the year we are expecting our cash tax rate to be in the low to midteens percent range turning to a review of our cash flow statement cash used for continuing operating activities was  million net decreases in our primary working capital accounts totalled  million the biggest changes included an increase in accounts and notes receivable of  million an increase in inventory of  million a decrease in accrued expenses of  million the unfavorable impacts of these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of  million given the seasonality of sales in our marine businesses we anticipate benefits from the liquidation of working capital over the balance of the year q  free cash flow was an outflow of  million versus a  million in the prior year a decline of  million capital spending was  million for the quarter which included investments in new products as well as capacity expansions in our marine and fitness segments capital spending and related payments are more heavily weighted to the first quarter as a result of the timing of certain capacity and product related initiatives let me conclude with comments on certain items that will impact our pl and cash flow for  our estimates for depreciation and amortization pension expense interest expense combined equity earnings and other income and shares outstanding have not changed since the prior call as a reminder we expect our diluted shares outstanding to be between  million and  million for the full year and range between  million and  million for the remaining  quarterly periods the reduction in average shares outstanding between quarterly periods and years reflects the execution of our share repurchase program our cash flow assumptions continue to project free cash flow in  to be greater than  million the guidance metrics we provided on january call for specific items such as working capital usage capital expenditures pension contributions cash taxes share repurchase and quarterly dividend are all unchanged we plan to continue to execute against our share repurchase program in  repurchases totalled  million in the first quarter and our plan reflects repurchases of approximately  million for the year we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive alternative to enhance shareholder returns i will now turn the call back to mark to continue our outlook comments mark d schwabero thanks bill our overall operating plans and assumptions for  remain relatively consistent with the longer term assumptions that were included in the  plan we communicated at our investor day in november of  and what we reiterated on the january call we continue to target  to be another year of outstanding earnings growth with excellent cash flow generation our plan reflects approximately  to  top line sales growth which includes the continuation of solid marine market growth in the us and europe as well as benefits from the success of our new products and market share gains the fitness segment is expected to benefit from overall growth in commercial fitness markets particularly in the second half of  completed acquisitions are included in this guidance and in total are expected to account for about  of the s projected growth we anticipate improvements in gross margin levels with improvement derived from volume increase and cost reductions related to efficiency initiatives the impacts of sales mix is projected to be relatively neutral for the year with more favorable comparisons planned in the second half operating expenses are estimated to increase in  as we continue to fund incremental investments to support growth however on a percentage of sales basis they are expected to be lower than  levels these investments will be directed toward new products initiatives that help us advance our productivity such as lean six sigma and investments to support our growth plans including information technology we will continue to see the benefits of these and prior investments as we move through  and into  the increases in gross margin and the reductions in operating expenses as a percent of sales are anticipated to result in higher operating margins while operating leverage will be in the highteen percentage range our guidance for  eps as adjusted is a range of  to  which is an increase from the guidance we communicated on the january call the increase in our outlook is primarily the result of the lower effective tax rate that bill discussed earlier coupled with our overall confidence that the underlying assumptions for business performance are playing out in line with our expectations our eps outlook for the second quarter reflects a low doubledigit percent growth rate with sales near the midpoint of the range of fullyear guidance turning to our segments the  forecast reflects continued revenue and operating earnings growth in our marine engine segment specifically we are planning for revenue growth for the year to be mid singledigits excluding the impact of future acquisitions this includes a stable to slightly improving pricing environment for our largerhorsepower engine businesses our engine segment is expected to continue to deliver sales growth that exceeds the market as we continue to invest in new products and to upgrade and expand our manufacturing capability to drive future growth we continue to anticipate operating margin improvements in  and  that outpaces our initial longterm planning estimates our continued emphasis on improving cost efficiencies and new product development will enable us to drive incremental operating margin expansion moving to the boat segment we are targeting s annual revenue growth in the high singledigit percentage range this growth rate anticipates that wholesale demand for large fiberglass sterndrive and inboard boats will be down for the full year this reflects the moderating industry demand in this category a stable product lineup and our efforts to prudently manage inventories we now anticipate that the yearoveryear increases in operating margins of approximately  to  basis points versus the prior year including the benefits from volume cost reduction and efficiency improvements partially offset by slightly unfavorable mix factors for the year we remain confident in our ability to deliver the operating margin improvements consistent with our  planning targets of  to  operating margin this confidence is supported by anticipating volume benefits planned efficiency gains new product introduction and actions to adjust to the evolving market conditions in certain markets these actions include the closure of our manufacturing facility in brazil management realignment activities and additional cost realignment these actions are expected to have a full year benefit of  million to  million with the majority of the improvement being realized in  in our fitness segment our plan is based upon continued revenue growth and improving operating margins in  including completed acquisitions we are targeting high singledigit revenue growth operating margins are expected to improve in  however the improvement will occur in the second half as several factors that influence the first quarter performance will continue into the second quarter consequently our operating earnings may be flat or down slightly in the second quarter looking to the second half our margin comparisons will benefit from the revenue increases and improved mix including the benefits from new products we will also benefit from costreduction actions initiated earlier this week which will provide a full year run rate benefit of approximately  million to our operating earnings a majority of which will impact  results starting with the acquisition of cybex in january of last year we embarked on a plan to transform the fitness business in  we successfully completed the first phase of that plan which included integrating the sga functions and realizing purchasing synergies moving into  were on track with changes to our manufacturing footprint which impacts a significant portion of our usbased operations these changes are integral to our ability to support our anticipated growth invest in our new products leverage the business platforms and manage our cost positions in addition our product development plans are on pace with benefits to both life fitness and cybex as we upgrade a meaningful portion of our cardio product lineup with stateoftheart technology and features this transformation plan combined with our strategies to develop or acquire products to serve our traditional customers as well as adjacent markets including group exercise and active aging gives us confidence in the growth prospects for this business and supporting our goal of returning our margins to  in  id like to close with a reminder of a few of the comments ive made back in the opening we believe that both the domestic and international marine markets have started the season in line with our expectation and that our product leadership will continue to advantage us in the marketplace the fitness business is successfully executing its strategy and is also well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and achieve its profit goals im confident that the management team and our  dedicated brunswick colleagues are committed to delivering and executing our growth strategy in  and beyond i believe our track record of our performance attest to our ability to focus on performance with that id be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from james hardiman with wedbush james hardiman i wanted to distil the guidance down as much as possible as always i appreciate a fantastic presentation but  pages i just want to make sure the changes versus last time are understood so the taxes are coming down it seems like both margins are coming down and so the guidance is going up  taxes are coming down more than that so netnet is the guidance ex taxes actually coming down to reflect the boat margin is that how i should think about this mark d schwabero as you look at the full year the indiscernible obviously from the sharebased compensation and taxes are a little more but you take what ill say as a little bit indiscernible first quarter and then a little bit of fx for the full year those two are probably the two pieces that are the other portion of the tax benefit james that isnt flowing through for the full year james hardiman okay thats helpful mark d schwabero so i dont think its anything for q through q its recognizing a little fx and recognizing a little of what we reported for the first quarter james hardiman okay and then just another clarification… william l metzger james the only other thing ill throw onto that i think as we tend to do at this point in time of the year we tend not to declare a victory prematurely so i think as we sit here and look at were three months into the year weve got a lot of work yet to do throughout the year and weve got our fitness projections as you can see are still relatively backhalf loaded i think its just prudent on our part to not necessarily take all of that tax upside to the full year guidance james hardiman sure understood and then the gross margin i guess miss in the first quarter can you give us a little bit more color around what happened there is that more of a onetime event or is this an issue that we should be thinking about going forward i guess specifically with the sterndrive and inboard indiscernible mark d schwabero james the miss probably two or three things are worth talking about first the shift in sales mix in the fitness business we had some international business which shifted to some larger customers that we did not necessarily expect and there were some product mix shifts that affected everything that we did not expect a little bit more severe than we expected and i would say we anticipate that those things tend to balance out over the year we just got into a quarter if you think about the underlying fundamentals in the fitness business were in a quarter where we had kind of stable demand so anything like a mix shift tends to have a fairly significant impact on gross margins in the period it occurs but i would say some of that is less permanent more timing and then on the boat side we certainly had a couple of adjustments in our large fiberglass boat business yacht and sport yacht business that we didnt necessarily expected added to that and again on the margins in boats i just want to point out that a year ago our mix was heavily tilted in a very favorable spot i pointed out in my remarks that margins were up  basis points leverage was very strong our mix this year probably is little bit tilted more towards value products than we would traditionally see again would expect some of that to balance out as we go throughout the year if you can tell from the asp comments asps were flat in q we expect them to be up for the year which i think implies that mix factors are maybe a little bit more favorable as we go throughout the remainder of the year james hardiman really helpful and then now that weve gotten some of the maybe some of the negatives in the quarter out of the way maybe i would assume that optimism is not likely to be reflected in your guidance coming out of the first quarter but there has been a lot of discussion about the divergence between hard data right gdp and employment versus soft data consumer confidence and the like and were hearing a lot of the same from the dealers that we talk to your biggest customer actually just raised their samestore sales guidance and is talking about increasing investment in preparation for maybe even better sales i guess as you talk to your customers and their customers ultimately and boaters are you hearing a lot of the same it doesnt seem like there is any hard data that would suggest things are going to accelerate versus last year but is there the potential for that to happen based on some of the commentary that youre hearing oneonone mark d schwabero yes james i think theres always the potential but again im going back to the earlier or  of the year and we have a lot of the same qualitative data i think weve also said in the comments that i had that wed expect the ssi data to probably go up as that data matures for the quarter so i think those things are going to show a little more positives than what some of the quantitative things are saying today but you have to remember were kind of off of the wholesale side and our pipelines are where we want them retail is kind of playing out as we expected so we get a few more months into the year well look at it and assess the whole thing but fundamentally for where were at in the year we think the year kind of looks like we expected at the start of the year james hardiman got it very helpful thanks guys operator the next question is from tim conder with wells fargo securities tim conder so again solid revenue growth but back to the boat operating margins and bill thank you for the explanation there both in the preamble and then in james question so i guess the best way again just to summarize what happened a high mix of aluminum boats some adjustments on the large fiberglass and you anticipate that to start reversing here in the second quarter and throughout the balance of the year so is that the best way to interpret what you said william l metzger i would say that the only thing id add to that tim would be lower sales of the bigger product as well so the combination of the lower sales the adjustments that i referenced combined with kind of the strong performance in the aluminum business and a little bit more of a valueoriented kind of element to what we sold this year were probably the biggest factors tim conder okay and specifically when youre saying the larger product are you talking larger product sterndrive versus outboard or yacht william l metzger its yachts and sport yachts its not the fiberglass outboard business its the sterndriveinboard business mark d schwabero sterndriveinboard about  feet to  tim conder okay and what indiscernible would you attribute that to i mean at this point william l metzger i think if you go back to the data we had weve had four consecutive quarters now of declines in that segment and i think part of that is obviously the retail the other its i think were being prudent on trying to balance the inventory and recognize the fact that from our perspective theres a bit more competition out there from the european market european manufacturers our ability to do anything really with the strength of the dollar of selling some of that product outside the us are limited and most of our new products are kind of launched and happening and in place so you take all those things together which is kind of why weve stated the position weve stated for that category of boats tim conder okay and then still staying on the sterndrive question you guys have made some reinvestments there it just seems again maybe the trends we thought wed see some stabilization start to recover but just this doesnt appear to be materializing to the degree then granted again that whole segment for the industry has shrunk dramatically how do you think about your investment in that segment of the engine market and the industry going forward mark d schwabero let me begin by theres always kind of – we still think that theres vessels that a sterndrive product is really the right product for that type of boat so that boat hasnt recovered category of boat hasnt recovered the same rate or pace that obviously some other segments have and thats not new news and another category is theres obviously the transition for having gone from sterndrive products at lower displacements over to outboards but tim i guess the other thing to put in perspective we think were in a better position going through this market today with how our product plans and investments and how we positioned our product portfolio we think were better off today than had we not repositioned our product the way we did tim conder oh no i totally agree i mean youve made the move there so just i guess the additional cost measures and so forth both in boats and fitness just some items there you would say that maybe unanticipated but for the balance of the year you do not believe – youve taken appropriate measures in the balance of the year and we should start to see the benefits in a larger i guess flowdown sales leverage flowing down to the bottom line is that fair mark d schwabero i think that well see some benefits particularly on the fitness side into the flowing later in the year the boats as a reminder most of the brazil stuff is the  benefit but im going to go back to a comment there tim a little i closed with is i think we have a reputation as being pretty good operators and when we see things that we think we need to adjust for in order to stay on target and on plan for our longerterm strategies we do that weve dealt with that through the decision on brazil and weve also taken some other cost actions inside boat and fitness recognizing the need to do that tim conder okay okay gentlemen thank you operator the next question is from scott hamann with keybanc scott hamann just some clarification on the fitness segment mark in your comments you kind of talked about maybe some structural shifts going on there can you kind of give us a sense of what that looks like i mean first quarter was it organically kind of in line with what you were looking for were there orders that were delayed or shifted into other quarters and just how should we think about how this kind of plays out mark d schwabero i think theres a couple of things and lets go back i guess ill go back i think as you look at just the pure club commercial market there is a little bit of transitioning going on as there may be a little less equipment base than where boutiques are at and the value clubs are at and theres probably a little bit of transitioning and stuff going on so i think the two biggest things that really are the triggers or the catalyst for some of this changing is weve had a number of quarters now where weve had small growth in the domestic market to flattish and so i think as we get to clubs needing to refresh and one of the reasons people decide to refresh is where youve got new products and things coming and were excited about new things that we have coming to both the life fitness and the cybex and if that triggers some of the refreshment thats going to go on in that segment i think well see some upticks there scott hamann okay and i guess on the boat side heard some positive commentary recently around the used boat market can you kind of provide some thoughts on what youre seeing there thanks mark d schwabero scott theres not a lot of hard data out there what i would tell you again its more the qualitative dealers are saying they really wish they had more used product and that the values of that used product are going up thats the same message weve talked about for some time so again typically as the gap between new and used closes or people believe that theyre getting a good tradein value and stuff on the product those things in our opinion bode well for new product sales but its largely qualitative scott scott hamann all right thanks operator the next question is from david macgregor with longbow research david macgregor i wanted to ask you about the yachts and sports yachts and your observation about that  to  category and im mindful its down  but wondering if were seeing a shift back into kind of the value portion of that segment which is kind of whitespace for you its kind of where meridian used to play and are you seeing that as a consequence of maybe losing some share there mark d schwabero the amount of that segment size david is really really small and i think the other part of it is i dont think its just the meridian question its really that whole value segment has dropped and theres a bunch of other people really trying to play in that segment making the investment in a value boat brand in that size today and being able to get a return on that investment just probably doesnt make sense particularly given the fx environment strength of the dollar so i think thats just one of the real realities and weve got a great brand in the sea ray and some great product lines and weve really elected to play in that fashion david macgregor thanks and then just as a followup i know you dont normally break out count on parts and accessories but is there any way you can give us some sense of just kind of the margin contribution from global parts and accessories i know marine engine was up  so im presuming it was greater than that but can you help us think about just magnitude of the yearoveryear there william l metzger we just traditionally go directional against what are externals gross margins obviously are going to be a measure higher than what our overall company gross margins are going to be and operating margins are the same we really dont get into the margins at all on that specific business david macgregor thanks very much operator the next question is from jimmy baker with b riley  co jimmy baker just the softness in – i just wanted to circle back to the softness in sterndrive and inboard boats so by our math thats call it  to  of your total revenue sport yacht and yachts within that that compete against the european brands even smaller so i guess on the surface it doesnt strike us as particularly material except when evaluating your capacity footprint so just help us understand as were hearing about some tightness in availability on the aluminum side and even from some whaler dealers what you can do to sort of improve your lets say mix of capacity to match whats going on at retail and where the demand trends are mark d schwabero weve got a nice plan in place for how we want to grow the boston whaler business a multiyear plan around the facilities and that campus were executing against i think as you look at the aluminum a lot of that gets to where youre at relative to the market and we think with trying to level load our plants and have the pipeline appropriately positioned for the year were fine with our aluminum capacity were adding a little bit of pontoon capacity to our low operations but from a facility and everything were positioned pretty well jimmy i think the thing that we always mentioned is when we talk about how we deal with capacity it includes that inventory and positioning for the year but its also a function of our supply base and its ability to support us so those two things kind of go together jimmy baker okay thats very helpful and just lastly i was hoping you could speak to some of the strengths within the domestic market speak to the strength geographically that you are seeing so obviously some of the slower reporting states are driving outperformance for you and the industry if we look at the variance between the preliminary ssi data and then what youre showing today so could you just shed some light on which of those states are fueling the outsized gains for you mark d schwabero the states that – you want to go to – im pulling up a piece of – you go to minnesota not reported wisconsin not reported as examples of some states that have a fair amount of aluminum and pontoons and unit volume in them so you have that – i would say that from a regional standpoint the area thats probably had more of a weather in the quarter was really the northeast but the main thing were talking about is theres some significant states that just arent in the numbers yet that have a lot of unit volume to go with them jimmy baker sure it makes sense thanks a lot william l metzger jimmy we got some visibility into outboard registrations industry outboard registrations by state weve got some visibility into floor plan liquidation activity by state as well as our own internal registration so when we triangulate that the states that are either not reported at all or incomplete are performing at a level thats higher than where the ssi data is reporting jimmy baker understood bill thanks for the time operator the next question is from mike swartz with suntrust michael a swartz just wanted to touch on the fitness business and understanding some of the puts and takes in the quarter but taking a step back you even said the last several quarters youve seen some kind of slower or stable growth in the commercial market yet youre expanding capacity around that some of thats obviously cybex so i guess what gives you comfort confidence ph that those investments in capacity on the fitness side are i guess justified william l metzger a couple of things i mean one of it is were doing the – obviously tying that to some of the new products which tends to have some demand stimulus around and as i mentioned if refresh and things go into place that has demand another element of this we elected as we had some of the demand that we were using outside third parties from the standpoint of supplying product to us and we continue to do that but as were bringing out new product part of what that capacity investment is is the insourcing of work that was formerly done on the outside which also brings us some nice margin returns to the business so when we talk about the expansion some of its tied to the market some of its tied to new products some of its tied to some insourcing thats related to that new product michael a swartz okay thats great and just on the… mark d schwabero mike its kind of all those items michael a swartz okay and then just on the canadian markets flipping over to the marine side i think the general sense is that canada is stabilizing maybe even getting a little better could you talk about are you seeing that i know you have production up in canada can you talk about it are you seeing that strength across both the internally manufactured product as well as maybe some of the stuff thats being imported into canada mark d schwabero let me just clarify it we make aluminum boats its princecraft in quebec and most of those boats are really kind of sold in the quebec province or are highly skewed to that province almost all the other boats that go into canada particularly a large market like ontario those are almost all imported products from the united states going in there and so they are all dealing with some of the same currency exposure and material cost et cetera im not sure if that answers your question or not mike michael a swartz i just didnt know if there was any discernible difference between the strength of internally produced product versus imported just on a broader sense mark d schwabero bill you might want to comment on it william l metzger mike you look at it one ill point out that were still dealing with relatively small numbers at retail the season up there is probably even more behind where the overall us market is so that would be point number one but so far weve actually seen some of our us brands outperform the stuff thats manufactured up there michael a swartz okay great thats helpful mark d schwabero but were not talking about size of numbers that are meaningful but i will say weve seen good strength in the product that weve manufactured in the us michael a swartz thanks operator our final question comes from seth woolf with northcoast research seth woolf thanks for squeezing me in here at the end dont want to belabor the point about the boat revision but just curious maybe if you could provide a little bit of context as to the timing of your decision to kind of revise the outlook specifically is there anything other than what youre seeing with retail dealer inventories that made you make that decision now three months after you gave the initial guide in january the reason i ask is because i think historically you guys have been pretty reluctant to change your guidance in the marine industry in the marine market after just three months mark d schwabero i think part of it bill went through a lot of the elements but if you look at from the standpoint of were mixing a little different on product for instance weve had tremendous success with some of the value product unitwise in our aluminum business you take what were seeing in brazil and to date charges there as well as when we look at what we think is being our desire to be a little more conservative from the standpoint of managing inventory and things on big boats you marry all those things together we just felt that its appropriate to get that out there were quite comfortable that were still going to deliver the  to  for  but we thought it was important to based upon things were seeing to pull that down for the year and get that on the table seth woolf okay thanks a lot guys thats all for me operator at this time we would like to turn the call back to the management team for some concluding remarks mark d schwabero all id like to do is again thank all of you for taking the time and spending some time with us on the phone today obviously those who want to do followup calls indiscernible some of you well be seeing on road
