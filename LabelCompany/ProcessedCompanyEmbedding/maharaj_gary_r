update or revise our forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events developments or otherwise we will also refer to nongaap measures because we believe they provide useful information to our investors todays news release contains a reconciliation table to gaap results this conference call is being webcast and is accessible through the investor relations section of the surmodics website where the audio recording of the webcast will also be archived for future reference a press release disclosing our quarterly results was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website at wwwsurmodicscom on todays call ill provide a review of our first quarter financial results and our fiscal  guidance gary will then provide an overview of our key achievements provide an update on execution of our strategy and plans for fiscal  and after garys overview we will open up the call to take your questions we are pleased to report that revenue for the first quarter of fiscal  rose  to  million compared with  million in the first quarter of last year driven by continued strength in the medical device segment on a gaap basis our diluted earnings totaled  per share compared to  per share in the prior year quarter fiscal  first quarter earnings included a  per share reduction from acquisition related amortization and contingent consideration accretion expenses offset by a euro denominated contingent consideration foreign currency transaction gain prior year first quarter earnings included a similar  per share reduction for acquisition related costs as well as a  per share from creagh medical acquisition cost on a nongaap comparative basis quarterly earnings per share were  in the first quarter of fiscal  versus  per share last year we delivered operating income of  million in the first quarter of fiscal  down from  million in the prior year period operating margin decreased from  to  in the current year quarter the declines in operating income and margin reflect higher planned investments in research development and other operating expenses to support our wholeproduct medical device strategy including the surveil drugcoated balloon turning now to our two business units medical device rose nicely to  million increasing  from the year ago period the growth stemmed from product royalties research development and other revenue looking at specific areas within medical device first quarter hydrophilic coating revenue totaled  million down slightly from last year royalty revenue was stronger than expected as our customers reported a higher mix of revenue in royaltybearing jurisdictions outside the united states as well as products that had migrated to more advanced generations of hydrophilic coatings product sales increased  million from the prioryear quarter primarily due to increased reagent shipments and our fiscal  acquisitions of creagh medical and normedix medical device customer research and development revenue rose  million for the quarter as a result of our recent acquisitions and higher demand for contract coating services to support customer clinical trials and select product launches this unit generated  million of operating income in the first quarter versus  million in the prior year quarter the medical device operating income was impacted by increases in planned investments related to our wholeproduct strategy as well as acquisition related amortization and accretion expense partially offset by increased margin from higher revenue and reduced acquisition related costs for our in vitro diagnostics unit first quarter fiscal  rose – totaled i should say  million a decrease of  from the year ago period as youll recall in the prioryear quarter we realized a  increase in revenue which creates a tough comp for ivd this quarter first quarter fiscal  ivd revenue was impacted by strong fourth quarter fiscal  sales in several product categories as well as a decline from a significant microarray customer that had previously been acquired by one of its competitors we expect a decline in revenue from this customer to continue through our third quarter looking at the year we expect fiscal  ivd revenue will be comparable to the prior year ivd operating income was  million compared to  million in the first quarter of fiscal  operating margin decreased to  versus  in the prioryear quarter due to lower revenue lets now turn to our first quarter  revenue summary by category first product sales totaled  million in the current quarter up  from the year ago period this increase was driven by medical device product sales including reagents and our fiscal  acquisition second royalty and license fees which are generated primarily in our medical device business unit came in at  million up slightly from last year and third research development and other revenue which is derived from our medical device segment was  million up nicely from  million a year ago this increase was driven by increased coating services and our fiscal  acquisitions product gross margin for the quarter was  of product sales compared to  in the prior year quarter reduction in product gross margins was largely the result of a  million loss from a damaged shipment from a vendor partially offset by improved product mix in our medical device segment as a percent of revenue first quarter rd expenses were  versus  in the year ago period rd expense of  million for the quarter was up  million from last year as we have stated we anticipate rd expenses to increase in the next three quarters as we accelerate our wholeproduct solutions strategy including advancing our surveil drugcoated balloon sga expenses in the first quarter of fiscal  were  of revenue versus  in the prior year period on a dollar basis sga in the first quarter of  totaled  million compared with  million a year ago the increase reflects the impact of our fiscal  acquisitions and infrastructure needed to support our wholeproduct strategy during the quarter the strong us dollar resulted in a  million gain on our euro denominated contingent consideration obligation related to the creagh medical acquisition this gain increased gaap earnings by  per share income tax expense was  of pretax income in the first quarter up from  in the prior year period the increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from nontax benefitted amortization accretion foreign currency gains and operating losses in ireland looking at our balance sheet which continues to be strong cash and investments totaled  million at the end of the quarter we generated cash flow from operations of  million during the first quarter of fiscal  and invested  million in plant and equipment during that period our current cash and investments and operating cash flows combined with surmodics  million line of credit provide adequate capacity to support our corporate strategic growth initiatives as a result of strong first quarter medical device revenue and our increasing clarity on dcb clinical trial plans for the remainder of fiscal  we are updating revenue and eps guidance for fiscal  the company now expects gaap revenue to range from  million to  million up from a previous range of  million to  million the company now expects diluted earnings per share loss in the range of a  loss to an  per share profit up from a previous range of  loss to a  profit further we expect nongaap earnings per share of  to  compared with the prior guidance of  to  per share our operational and financial results from the first quarter were strong surpassing our expectations thank you to the entire team in the us and ireland for your hard work and outstanding results gary gary r maharaj thank you andy let me echo andy and say that im quite pleased about the teams performance in the first quarter we demonstrated meaningful progress in each of our three major objectives for fiscal  these were to meet our overall revenue and profitability goals in our core businesses while managing the outside of the us expiration of significant royalty generating patents in our medical coatings business second to invest in and achieve significant milestones in our dcb programs and secure regulatory approvals in our catheter and balloon rd pipeline and third to expand our operational capacity for high quality and costefficient manufacturing through continued investment for our first objective as you heard from andy we grew revenue  in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last fiscal year and achieved gaap diluted earnings of  per share again strong performance regarding our second objective we have several aggressive milestones targeted in our drug delivery programs we intend to seek the regulatory approval to initiate the next clinical development phase of our surveil drugcoated balloon to this end we successfully completed the day followup on all patients treated to date and are encouraged by the results we are currently in discussions with the relevant regulatory agency as we propose our plans for the next clinical trial with surveil we anticipate clarity in this outcome in our third fiscal quarter in addition we have chosen and engaged a full service contract research organization or cro to plan and eventually conduct this major clinical trial our sirolimusbased belowtheknee drugcoated balloon program continues to make progress using our own internally developed  balloon platform we are conducting a major dosing study that will help determine the most appropriate drug amount that could provide optimum biological effect with maximum safety looking at our nondrug delivery pipeline we expect to submit three new product indications to regulators in the next several months we are on plan and have completed the designs of our  and  peripheral balloon catheters incorporating our proprietary serene hydrophilic coating we have also made significant progress in our microcatheter project using surmodics pristyne coating going beyond the benchtop testing and actually successfully conducting preclinical testing where the microcatheter achieved its intended performance goals so we are on track on these all planned regulatory submissions and anticipate approvals which will then help us build on our platform and accelerate growth and finally with respect to operational readiness in our ballinasloe ireland facility we have installed and qualified new clean rooms they can handle both drug delivery and nondrug delivery devices and have effectively doubled the footprint of our clean room manufacturing giving the company important scale and ability to quickly ramp production we will put these new clean rooms into use in the second half of fiscal  our progress in each of these areas continues to guide our capital allocation choices in fiscal  we believe that the best way for surmodics to maximize longterm shareholder value is to accelerate these investments in core rd programs that will drive our strategic transformation we have a unique opportunity to make surmodics more relevant to our customers by creating products of enduring substantial and differentiated value to both clinicians and patients to do this we are shifting our balance and reinvesting more of the cash flow we generate from our core business operations into executing our emerging wholeproduct solutions strategy this investment is critical to our success remember our objective is to generate consistent revenue growth in the midteens on a constant currency basis and ebitda margins greater than  within three years we believe that fiscal  is a pivotal investment year and expect to see the initial returns from our investments via revenue growth beginning in fiscal  its an exciting time at surmodics and we are encouraged by our strong performance and operational progress we are executing our strategy to become a leading highvalue innovator in vascular medicine our acquisitions in fiscal  along with surmodics unique drug delivery and surface technology provide us unique capabilities in the vascular device industry we cant stress enough how important it is that we continue to invest in and lever these capabilities now for maximum market impact and to secure longterm value for our shareholders rest assured that we will accomplish this in a characteristically disciplined fashion our track record demonstrates and that you have come to expect from us operator this concludes our prepared remarks wed now like to open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from jim sidoti with sidoti  company please go ahead james sidoti so obviously very strong quarter on royalties better than i had expected you mentioned some of that was overseas royalty now just confirm will that start to slow down the next quarter as some of those patents expired in december of  andrew lafrence yes jim the ous patent for our generation  hydrophilic coatings expired on october  of  and as youll recall we have a one quarter delay in terms of reporting from our customers so we do expect to start seeing the impact of the ous expiration in the upcoming quarters james sidoti okay and then sga spending you mentioned some of that was because of the investments youre making in ro ph and should we expect that to stay around that  million for the rest of the year or you think that would slow down as we get towards the end of the year andrew lafrence jim ill go back to our original guidance and weve guided – ill give a couple of components there sga spending we expect to be in the high upper  of revenue for the year and thats really reflective of the infrastructure were putting together to support the wholeproduct solutions and just another reminder in terms of the rd expense which was about  of revenue for the quarter we expect that to be in the high s to low  for the entire year of revenue james sidoti okay and then the last question below the operating line you had a pretty significant gain in investment income can you just remind me what that was andrew lafrence jim that was related to the creagh medical acquisition we have up to € million contingent consideration obligation thats payable in december of  and given the fact that the us dollar strengthened against the euro during the quarter we actually had a gain of about  or so or about  per share were not guiding any future gains or losses on that obligation and those all will get run through our nongaap disclosures in terms of earnings as well as eps but that is specifically related to that obligation related to the creagh acquisition james sidoti okay so thats different from the contingent consideration or accretion thats reported above the… andrew lafrence thats correct theres actually a couple of pieces there related to the contingent consideration one is a continual accretion of the underlying obligation based upon the time value of money and the second is the marking the market based upon the change in the us dollar to the euro james sidoti i understand okay thank you and now on the progress with the surveil you said you hired a cro and youre in discussions with the fda so i guess im a little confused what does the cro do now are they participating in the discussions gary r maharaj to be clear i said were in discussions with the relevant regulatory agency i didnt specify the fda but what a full contract cro does i mean depending on the scale of a clinical it could be anywhere depending on what we get approval to but it could be anywhere up to  clinical sites so cro actually helps with the clinical trial design they are study monitors are the ones that manage and monitor the sites and ensure the data integrity and the streaming to the core labs and so surmodics clearly doesnt have that inhouse capability to run a major clinical so the cro actually runs the clinical for us and thats also good because its handsoff in terms of the data so you have to hire a cro at our scale and thats a major – but were still in a contracting process with them but i should say we have chosen them and have started working with them on the trial design already james sidoti okay and based on your guidance i mean it seems like earnings are going to be down pretty significantly the next couple of quarters so i assume that that means payments related – charges related to the trial are going to continue to go up as we get through the fiscal year andrew lafrence jim if you think about it first quarter rd expense being at  of revenue and needing to get up to the high s to low s in terms of overall expenditure as a percent of revenue thats going to drive a significant amount of incremental spend planned spend that we have related to rd so yes we will expect to see that impact earnings in the latter half of the year james sidoti all right thank you operator operator instructions well take our next question from mike petusky with barrington research please go ahead michael petusky i guess gary on the new product submissions whats your current thinking in terms of timetable for actual and i think some of this is not completely in your hands but in terms of your goals for product launches at this point gary r maharaj first of all the submissions is the one thing were in control of when we finish the validation and verification of these designs and the idea then is to submit it – we have to make some choices of european ce mark and k us fda clearances but the submission to the approval could be as much as four to five months so wed like to get them in early so we can actually secure approvals and readiness for fiscal  revenue the step after approval which we are running in parallel is working with strategic customers who have holes in their current product portfolio who need these products and there are several strategics in each of these categories that we would want to then be able to provide these products so that the strategics become in essence our distributor of these products on a worldwide basis and so that concurrent step post approval is to get uptake from the strategics and the third part of that is in our ballinasloe our irish facility is to have validated the production processes for these so that we can make them in a costefficient high quality manufacturing environment so theres three things going on at once get secured regulatory clearances or approvals start working with the relevant strategics to stimulate their interest and fill their pipeline where they need it and third really get these products being cranked out in our highquality manufacturing systems michael petusky so in fiscal  i mean how many products would you anticipate at this point actually being commercially launched gary r maharaj three we have two balloon catheters in them but also keep in mind that pipeline building and investments continue so we are already working on product approvals that were going to be submitting in fiscal  this year so theres a lot going on in rd but the three that are ready for primetime will be ready for launch in fiscal  michael petusky okay all right and then andy i guess im struggling on the tax piece can you just speak to what your expectations are for effective tax rate for the remainder of this year and then if you have a thought about how that might change into the next fiscal year andrew lafrence mike the effective tax rate as a percentage is really a tough one to articulate given that youve got a number of moving factors here including the fact that we have a number of nondeductible expenses which is amortization and accretion for example this quarter we ended up having the gain on – the foreign currency translation gain related to the creagh medical obligation we have out there and thats not tax effected and then we have losses in ireland and so we cant really predict the fx gains or losses that are out there we do have a pretty good understanding of what the amortization and accretion should be based upon no changes in assumptions and also what the ireland piece is going to be but the way we think about that we dont think about in terms of percentages we actually think about it in terms of dollars just given that its really tough and given that we are in a wild situation in ireland right now so the guidance that we would give today would be that we expect our tax expense to be between  million and  million for fiscal  and obviously that will fluctuate based upon how we perform on the top line for the rest of the year michael petusky okay and thats  million or  million inclusive of what youre just reporting in other words an incremental  million to  million  million or so approximately andrew lafrence thats correct thats inclusive of the q reported numbers michael petusky okay all right very good thanks guys operator well take our next question from brooks oneil with lake street capital markets please go ahead brooks oneil i just was hoping you might be willing to talk a little bit about your assessment of the dcb market right now and how you view the overall market growth the competitive picture and maybe most importantly just talk a little bit about how you see your product fitting into the competitive picture over the next year or two gary r maharaj certainly thanks brooks and by the way welcome to the call i dont think you and i have talked on the call before so welcome i came back from the leipzig interventional conference last week in germany the linc meeting im very excited i mean there was still a huge buzz about drugcoated balloons especially as you see now moving beyond the superficial femoral artery there seems to be getting some traction below the knee and bard lutonix released their first ever data on av fistula treatment with drugcoated balloons and av access and showed some pretty good results i mean the patency with the av fistulas was  and the plain old balloons were less than   i believe so in terms of the current market and the future expansion i think the confidence is growing in drugcoated balloons and thats a positive thing for us as we also look to expand into belowtheknee and our own av access products so we called our irish team we already have an av access balloon on the us market and so we now have a drug carrier for our drugs so the short answer is confidence is high as far as the sfa market goes clearly theres a plethora of clinicals going on now i think you all heard after the jp morgan conference about some scientific is getting ready to start their clinical even as the stellarex spectranetics device is expected to get hopefully get their pma approval shortly this year so the sfa market is intensifying one thing to note is that the threeyear outcome data as we have seen these devices being used over a period of years the patency which is a very important measure is dropping and i think even in the admiral inpact medtronic study i think the threeyear patency rates are of the order of  perhaps now which is still way better than balloons but the question of who will win this market longterm will come down to longterm data that demonstrate a continued effect of the drug in the three to fouryear timeframe so short answer is were happy to participate we love to see the devices get approved and we believe we have a much more advanced generation device compared to those in the market but we have to demonstrate that in a clinical so thats our next step brooks oneil so thats really helpful i appreciate all that data so you would say that the secret sauce if im understanding it correctly is the ability to keep the drug in place in the artery and have it remain effective over a long period of time or how would you think about that and is that a function of the drug or is it more a function of the way you deliver the drug to the site gary r maharaj theres so many opinions even by the people who know more than i do in their specific drugdelivery field of whats the mechanism and how it works but clearly from a marketplace point of view being very efficient with the drug transfer in other words not having to use a lot of drug to get the drug into the tissue is very critical i continue to believe cost of goods and manufacturing yield which is not very often talked about is incredibly critical as prices are very nice now in the us to us range in united states but some day with competition and more players in the market those prices will come down so having a really efficient manufacturing process where you have the margin and the quality for the staying power in this market is going to be very important and certainly as you said getting the drug to deliver to the tissue getting it to stick around to have a prolonged biological effect while staying away from toxic effects is critical i dont know if anyone understands the real longterm mechanisms of this we understand it on stents and i think that body of knowledge is now being created in the drugcoated balloon market but clearly people would love to see fiveyear really good fiveyear data with high data integrity to see whats going on with these patients brooks oneil all right thats very helpful thank you very much operator well take our next question from beth lilly with gamco investors please go ahead elizabeth lilly so i wanted to just drill down a little bit more in terms of the cro and next steps in terms of the development so you now are confident enough with the results that you have engaged a cro to help design a trial is that correct gary r maharaj yes elizabeth lilly okay so can you walk us through with the timing in that and what other data you need to submit to the fda in the whole process to get the approval just whats the timing with everything now gary r maharaj to submit to the appropriate regulatory agency and you have multiple worldwide regulatory agencies as you can imagine but clearly the next step typically is to do a traditional feasibility study in the range of  maybe probably a little more patients and why sponsors do that is to certainly look for any safety other safety signals theyve missed in a broader patient population andor to understand the effectiveness of the product so they can design a trial for us thats one viable step the other step is somewhat unprecedented is to go into a major clinical and carefully ensure that youre monitoring a patient safety in the early stages of enrollment try to do it as much realtime as possible but also you have to make assumptions on the effectiveness of your product to design the statistical power of the trial we believe we have seen with the stellarex illumenate trial there have now been three rcts in the us that really demonstrate the effectiveness of drugcoated balloon so we have to choose which of those pathways a traditional feasibility or going straight to a major pivotal now as much as we want to choose whatever we believe the optimum is the respective regulatory agency has to agree with that agree with the trial design and agree with the safety monitoring and so that is the stage were in right now where we are working through the issues to be able to secure the regulatory goahead to start the next level of clinical trials for the product that timing in terms of regulatory filings and discussions its always hard to accurately predict but we believe that we will have an answer in our third quarter from the regulatory agency elizabeth lilly okay and then from there once the regulatory agencies they come back with their recommendation from there then the cro will then help you to take either the feasibility study path or the pivotal path correct gary r maharaj yes the cro then and they will engage even before that because you could imagine if youre doing a major clinical it could be   sites all right then some in the us some outside of the us and you have to contract with those sites you have to set up the trial you have this breathtaking amount of work to be done to be able to start getting enroll the patients and to be able to complete enrollment as quickly as possible the machine then takes over really in an effective manner getting these trial sites up and running elizabeth lilly okay last question along those lines so in terms of the increase in rd spending this year was this hiring of the fullservice cro factored into that guidance andrew lafrence yes it was factored in the guidance elizabeth lilly okay all right those were all my questions thanks much operator our next question comes from ben haynor with feltl and company please go ahead ben haynor just wanted to kind of focus a little bit more on the k product i was wondering if you could kind of discuss some of the performance characteristics of not only the balloons but also the microcatheter i believe you mentioned the microcatheter specifically being able to do collateral retrograde and could you talk a little bit about where that might be important as well gary r maharaj i would say on the collateral retrograde thats my wishlist that ive told our rd team but that being said i believe that will be one of the attributes that has to be determined so lets start with the balloon catheters  and  really relates to the size or the gauge of the guidewire that these balloon catheters travel over and the  really you want to get deeper below behind the knee and  really gets you to the superficialfemoral artery and a little deeper down but really more and more people are using the  guidewires for both the sfa treatment and to get behind the popliteal vessels which are just further south the  which is a much thinner guidewire as the title says and that really is to get deeper into the belowtheknee vessels and when you start getting into  and  type balloon platforms the deliverability the crossing profile and the hydrophilic coating become very very important because youre crossing difficult lesions youre crossing calcified lesions youre crossing long deceased lesions so our view on those is really nice tight tracked crossing profile really good hydrophilic coating that also is not minimizing the particulates coming from some of these coatings and the ability to expand these balloons to appropriate working pressures for both belowtheknee and popliteal so those – we have a large database on how everybody in the market performs maybe i should say not technically everybody but the major players and we believe these devices will win on deliverability balloon expansion the trackability the key performance features that clinicians look for on the microcatheter there are a couple of products of that currently on the market i think a couple of them are mainly the japanese type manufacturers theyve had a big headstart in these microcatheters and the trick there is you have a microcatheter that has a certain length and a certain port of entry it could be femoral it could be radial who knows it could even be potentially pedal depending on the developers ph choice but they start off already slender and then they taper down to a  french shaft at closer to end there which is  millimeters so the technology to create this threadlike device that is tapering and has different flexibilities all the way down to the tip is easier said than done and where that helps you is crossing difficult lesions and collateral retrograde is a specific way instead of doing pedal access and coming up the leg you can probably take a detour in the collateral vessel and not have this create another access point to the patient so very few products are able to do that and we believe our microcatheter with the pristyne coating will cross the difficult lesions but actually has the length to be able to have access from any point of entry so i would say it was my wishlist thing that i know the rd team is really diligently working on that and ive seen them be very successful in the preclinical data so far ben haynor okay great thats very helpful and it sounds like youve already been engaged in some discussions with potential strategic licensors can you talk about the appetite there and anything any color that you could provide would be great gary r maharaj yes i would say the balloons are better but i would say they are what id call evolutionary better meaning they actually perform better than the devices we have tested and so there is interest from the strategics who do need better performing balloons to compete i believe i dont have all the data to back this up but my belief is the microcatheter is substantially newtotheworld better device and there are a lot of strategics who would want to have a particular type of microcatheter like this we just have to work out who we believe would be the best partner and of course they would be looking to say hey do you have the approval it makes no sense going too far in a relationship until the approval is secured so thats a process we are actually engaged in over the next quarter quarter and a half ben haynor okay great and then lastly for me it sounds like we should before too long hear about some more k products do you think that will be disclosed this fiscal year and then i think you started out with the goal of one here it looks like were going to get three this year or early in your fiscal  but it also sounds like the development is going really well on the rd side so could we see that one per year wind up being two per year or even three per year gary r maharaj so the rd team is right outside the door waiting to beat me up if i give too many answers here i would say they are clearly already working you know how its designed we have the earlystage feasibility and so were already working on things wed like to key up to submit in fiscal  i think wed probably message that in our fourth quarter earnings call when we have better clarity because you could be working on five things only of which two or three might become viable to meet the specifications were looking at but our intent is to have at least two new approvals per year hopefully more andrew lafrence and ben if i could just put a little clarity going back to a couple of quarters ago when we talked about the investment thesis for these acquisitions and we talked about there being  to  proprietary products over a five year period so that cadence is two to three products a year and we did talk about one product initially getting approval for launch in fiscal  and youre right that we actually have three so the cadence going forward would be somewhere in the two to three new products a year ben haynor okay thats very helpful thank you very much gentlemen operator there are no further telephone questions at this time id like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks gary r maharaj thank you for all of your questions we are pleased with our first quarter results and our progress on our wholeproduct solutions strategy continues to accelerate i look
