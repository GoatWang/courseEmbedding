during the period the program is in effect except with respect to any repurchase program established in accordance with rule b under the exchange act sponsor provident and their respective affiliated purchasers as defined in rule  of regulation m under the exchange act will not make any bids for or purchases of sponsor class a shares during the period the program remains in effect an eligible

shareholder has requested that a stock certificate be issued representing the sponsor class a shares to be sold or payment in an amount equal to the number of shares to be purchased multiplied by the market price of such shares on an earlier specified date it is anticipated that such price will equal or exceed the price of the shares to be purchased any advance payment will be deposited upon receipt by the bank or brokerdealer and held in a noninterest bearing account established by the bank or brokerdealer the conversion agent will send a refund check issued by the bank or brokerdealer to participants in the program in cases where the actual price paid for new sponsor class a shares is lower than the price paid to the bank or brokerdealer conversely the conversion agent will send an invoice to participants in the program when the actual price paid exceeds the amount paid to the bank or brokerdealer authorizations may be returned to the conversion agent at any time after the conversion agent first mails them out and during the time that the program is in effect but will be irrevocable upon mailing to the conversion agent authorizations that are incomplete or that are received by the conversion agent after the expiration of the program will not be processed and will be invalid if either a validly executed authorization or if any stock certificate was issued a properly endorsed stock certificate is not received by the conversion agent the eligible shareholder will be notified by the conversion agent that the sponsor class a shares cannot be sold until the missing documentation is received all sale and purchase instructions received for a particular business day will be combined and processed together by the bank or a brokerdealer all purchase instructions will be supervised and processed by either the bank or a brokerdealer using its employees some of whom may also be employees of the conversion agent all salepurchase authorizations will be electronically timestamped upon receipt by the conversion agent the conversion agent will accumulate all authorizations received each business day and calculate the number of sponsor class a shares covered by such salepurchase authorizations each a batch buy andor sell orders in roundlots will be placed by the conversion agent with the brokers in the order that such salepurchase authorizations are received by the conversion agent the conversion agent will first satisfy on a firstin firstout basis any purchase requests received from eligible shareholders out of shares received under the program from eligible shareholders seeking to sell their shares if sale authorizations exceed purchase authorizations the conversion agent will place an order with one of the brokers subject to the accumulation of shares necessary to equal a roundlot as described below to sell the excess shares in the open market in the event purchase authorizations exceed sale authorizations the conversion agent will place an order with one of the brokers subject to the accumulation of shares necessary to equal a roundlot as described below to purchase sufficient shares in the open market to satisfy the deficiency all salepurchase authorizations received each day will be combined and processed together as noted above to the extent that authorizations in a batch cannot be offset against each other buy andor sell orders in roundlots will be placed by the conversion agent with the brokers in the order that such salepurchase authorizations are received by the conversion agent notwithstanding the foregoing if there has occurred any act of god nature war or terrorism mechanical or electrical breakdown computer failure failure or unavailability of the federal reserve bank wire facsimile internet telex or other transaction or communications system or power supply in each case the effect of which is such as to make it in the judgment of the conversion agent after taking into account all commercially reasonable means of doing so impracticable to process purchase and sale instructions under the program  if trading in any equity securities of sponsor has been suspended or materially limited by the sec or the nyse or if trading generally on the nyse has been suspended or materially limited or  if a banking moratorium has been declared by either federal or new york authorities  then order placements will not be made during the pendency of such events order placements will be made by the close of the nyse on the trading day following the expiry of such events it is anticipated that the conversion agent will remit salepurchase orders to the brokers on the next nyse trading day after each batch is created and that the brokers will sell shares covered by an order not later than the close of business on the third business day after receipt of the order from the conversion agent for purposes of determining the price of purchases and sales all purchases and sales made in the batch will receive the same price accordingly if the conversion agent remits an openmarket purchase order all purchase orders in the batch will be assigned the same purchase price per share similarly if the conversion agent remits an openmarket sale order all sale orders in the batch will be assigned the same sale price per share such purchase or sale price will be the weighted average price per share of the shares required to be purchased or sold in the open market if no openmarket purchases or sales are effected for the program in a batch and the only transactions that occur are sales orders made under the program that are offset against purchase orders made under the program the price at which sales and purchases shall be executed will be the closing price of the sponsor class a shares during the day in which the batch was created as reported in the wall street journal the brokers will effect all transactions in connection with the program in the open market on the floor of the nyse in the ordinary course of their business and for the duration of the program the brokers will not purchase or sell sponsor class a shares for their own account or the account of any affiliated purchaser as defined in rule  of regulation m under the exchange act in connection with the program the brokers will effect brokers transactions solely as agents on an unsolicited basis for eligible shareholders the brokers may also cross solely on an agency basis sales and purchase orders in sponsor class a shares submitted by their customers all such crossing transactions will be effected by the brokers on the floor of the nyse and the brokers will not conduct negotiations off the floor of the nyse with respect to such transactions the brokers will accept instructions regarding the program solely from the conversion agent and in conducting the program will act independently of sponsor and its affiliates purchases and sales of sponsor class a shares made by the brokers under the program will be subject solely to the instructions and control of the conversion agent in all cases the conversion agent will mail to eligible shareholders proceeds refunds of or excess purchase price under the program if any or a statement or stock certificate if requested for shares purchased through the program within  business days of the date of completion of their sell or buy order  discussion section  of the securities act for the reasons described below it is our opinion that the purchase and sale of sponsor class a shares pursuant to the program would not require registration under section  of the securities act as discussed above other than with respect to the preparation of the materials related thereto sponsors role in the program will be strictly administrative in nature and sponsor will not actively encourage participation in the program furthermore the factors that the staff has previously relied upon in taking a noaction position with respect to the applicability of section  of the securities act to oddlot sale programs coupled with roundup features and that the staff has traditionally looked to in determining whether there has been an offering of a security by or on behalf of an issuer for purposes of the securities act are satisfied in the instant case specifically i sponsor will have been subject to the periodic reporting requirements of section a under the exchange act for a period of at least  days prior to commencement of the program ii sponsor class a shares will have been registered under section  of the exchange act iii eligible shareholders will not be guaranteed any minimum sales price iv no participating eligible shareholders will be paid any additional consideration for the elimination of their oddlot position v purchases of roundup shares will be made by the brokers only on an agency basis in the open market upon the order of the conversion agent and only if there are insufficient matching sale orders from eligible shareholders vi all sales by eligible shareholders that are not offset by roundup orders will be made by the brokers only on an agency basis in the open market upon the order of the conversion agent vii the commission received by the brokers will be no more than the usual and customary brokerage fees viii neither the conversion agent nor the brokers will engage in any special selling efforts as that phrase is used in the definition of distribution in rule  of regulation m of the exchange act ix the brokers will conduct sales in a manner designed to avoid any undue impact on the market for sponsor class a shares x none of sponsor the conversion agent or their respective affiliates will enter into any arrangement with the brokers with respect to potential purchases of shares sold or purchased under the program xi the sponsor class a shares purchased to meet excess roundup purchase orders will be publicly traded shares sold on the nyse xii sponsor provident the conversion agent and the brokers will not purchase or sell any shares sold under the program on behalf of their own accounts or on behalf of the accounts of affiliates xiii the brokers will effect crossing transactions with respect to the program only on the floor of the nyse and will not solicit either side of such transactions or conduct negotiations off the floor of the nyse with respect to such transactions xiv purchases of sponsor class a shares to meet excess roundup purchase orders will not be made from eligible shareholders and xv neither sponsor nor any of its affiliates will play more than a de minimis inactive role in the program furthermore we have advised sponsor that it is our opinion that brokerage transactions effected by brokers acting as agents for the conversion agent and for eligible shareholders on the floor of the nyse would be exempt from registration under section  of the securities act the brokers will not effect such transactions in a principal capacity for themselves or any of their affiliates as described above the brokers will not nor will any of their affiliates solicit such transactions the brokers will effect crossing transactions with respect to the program only on the floor of the nyse and will not conduct negotiations off the floor of the nyse with respect to such transaction or solicit either side of such transactions directly or indirectly or by means of any interdealer communications system further in order to provide for and ensure compliance with this undertaking the brokers will represent to sponsor that while the program is in effect they will maintain records adequate to identify unsolicited trades in sponsor class a shares and support the unsolicited nature of all transactions including crossing transactions involving the program based upon and subject to the foregoing we request that the staff confirm to us that it would not recommend enforcement action against sponsor provident the conversion agent the brokers any of their affiliates or their respective officers directors or employees if sales and purchases of sponsor class a shares pursuant to the program are conducted without compliance with the registration provisions of the securities act section d of the exchange act a tender offer typically involves an offer by an issuer or a third party or group to purchase securities for its own account it is our opinion given the fundamental differences between the program and the types of transactions that the tender offer provisions are designed to address that sponsors sponsorship of the program will not constitute a tender offer within the meaning of section  d of the exchange act the term tender offer implies that i there is active and widespread solicitation of public shareholders for the shares of an issuer ii the solicitation is made for a substantial percentage of the issuers stock iii the offer to purchase is made at a premium over the prevailing market price iv the terms of the offer are firm rather than negotiable v the offer is contingent on the tender of a fixed number of shares vi the offer is open only for a limited period of time vii the offeree is subject to pressure to sell its stock and viii there is public announcement of an acquisition program prior to or with the accumulation of stock by a purchaser the most important of these elements will not be present in the program specifically there will be no solicitation of salepurchase authorizations in the sense of any of sponsor provident or the conversion agent making any recommendation to eligible shareholders to the contrary the program description materials will expressly state that no such party is making any recommendation regarding the purchase or sale of sponsor class a shares additionally the program will be made available only to eligible shareholders  eligible shareholders who sell sponsor class a shares through the program will not receive any premium over the market price on the date of sale  the terms of the offer will be firm only in the sense that eligible shareholders who sell or purchase sponsor class a shares in a trading days batch through the program will invariably receive or pay a price based on the price of all sponsor class a shares sold or purchased through the program in that batch  the program will not be contingent upon the participation of any fixed number of eligible shareholders or the salepurchase of any fixed number of sponsor class a shares eligible shareholders will not be subject to any pressure to participate in the program the program is being provided solely as an accommodation to eligible shareholders who may wish to purchase or sell sponsor class a shares without the payment of commissions or other expenses as indicated above the description materials provided to eligible shareholders will merely advise them that the program exists without making any recommendation  the program will not be preceded or accompanied by a rapid accumulation of stock except as described herein neither sponsor nor provident will enter into any arrangement with the brokers or the conversion agent with respect to purchases or sales of sponsor class a shares pursuant to the program the conversion agent and the brokers will be acting solely in an agency capacity for eligible shareholders any purchases or sales not made in offsetting transactions from eligible shareholders will be made in the open market exclusively for accounts of eligible shareholders participating in the program and not for sponsor or any of its affiliates the sec has granted noaction relief under section d of the exchange act to a number of demutualizing insurance companies operating similar commission free purchase and sale programs it is difficult to determine with any certainty the amount of sponsor class a shares that will be held by eligible shareholders at the time of commencement of the program as of may   approximately  sponsor class a shares are held by existing sponsor shareholders holding  or fewer shares it is estimated that approximately  eligible members will be allocated less than  sponsor class a shares in the conversion of provident to a stock insurer representing approximately  million sponsor class a shares however since these eligible members will be entitled to elect whether or not they prefer to receive cash as consideration in the sponsored demutualization instead of sponsor class a shares subject to certain limits on the amount of cash that may be paid in the transaction it is expected that less than  eligible members actually will be eligible to participate in the program it should be noted that in the event cash is oversubscribed it will be allocated based on priorities set forth in the merger agreement which gives eligible members with the smallest share allocations a priority for receipt of cash instead of the sponsor class a shares assuming  million nfs class a shares are issued in the sponsored demutualization all  estimated potential odd lot eligible members receive share consideration and the number of other nfs shareholders with odd lot positions remains constant approximately  of sponsors class a common stock and  of its common stock expected to be outstanding after consummation of the sponsored demutualization would be held by eligible shareholders however because the consideration election and allocation process has not yet occurred the actual percentage of outstanding sponsor class a shares that will be eligible to participate in the program and the level of participation cannot be determined at present sponsor notes that the sec has granted noaction relief under section d of the exchange act with respect to commission free purchase and sale programs where the percentage of outstanding shares eligible to participate in the program was of similar scope as a result of a largescale demutualization importantly the program is required by the plan of conversion and the commissioner will require sponsor to make every effort to implement the program consistent with the terms of the plan of conversion sponsor does not anticipate that the program will involve such a substantial percentage of the issued and outstanding sponsor class a shares that it is appropriate or necessary to limit participation in the program in order to avoid a market impact indeed the program will be operated in a manner designed to avoid any substantial market impact moreover the operation of the program should help to ameliorate any market impact each eligible shareholder will independently decide whether or not to participate in the program and will be free to sell or purchase sponsor class a shares outside the program or to retain such shares therefore we believe that the staff should not consider the program to constitute a tender offer we are aware however that in the past the staff has taken the position that commissionfree sales and purchase programs similar to the program may be issuer tender offers even if the program is determined to involve an issuer tender offer it is our opinion that the program if conducted as described herein would be in compliance with release no  and excepted from rule e and rule lb by virtue of rule eh the program will be available to all eligible shareholders and the price paid by or to each eligible shareholder will be based on the market price of sponsor class a shares on the date the transaction is effected thus we are of the view that sponsor and its affiliates are exempt from compliance with rule e in connection with the program see trigon healthcare inc  sec noact lexis  july   as a result no relief is sought from rule e in connection with the operation of the program in addition the program will not involve any special selling efforts or selling methods and thus will not involve a distribution as defined in rule  of regulation m under the exchange act accordingly no relief is sought from regulation m for purchases of sponsor class a shares by sponsor pursuant to a rule b open market repurchase program during the pendency of the program  conclusion based on the foregoing we request confirmation that the staff will not recommend the sec take any enforcement action against sponsor provident the conversion agent the brokers any of their affiliates or their respective officers directors or employees if the sale and purchase of sponsor class a shares pursuant to the program are conducted without compliance with the registration provisions of the securities act and   the program is conducted without compliance with section d of the exchange act and regulation d thereunder in view of the timing of the proposed sponsored demutualization we would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience if you require additional information or have any questions concerning this request please do not hesitate to contact alexander m dye at   or the undersigned at   our fax number is   very truly yours michael groll endnotes  sponsor is not seeking any noaction relief from the sec in connection with the operation of the bank sponsored program  it should be noted that in accordance with customary practice order placements will also be suspended for  trading days before and  trading days after the record date for the payment of dividends on sponsor class a shares order placements will be made by the close of the nyse on the trading day following the expiry of any such period  see eg anthem insurance companies inc  sec noact lexis  oct   amerus group co
