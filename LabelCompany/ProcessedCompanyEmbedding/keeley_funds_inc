history investment philosophy process press releases keeley value strategy keeley dividend value strategy contact us individual investor investment professional keeley funds  our story keeleyteton advisors llc was formed in late  as a whollyowned subsidiary of teton advisors inc and served as an acquisition vehicle for the purchase of the asset management business of keeley asset management corp a pioneer in small and midcap value investing founded by john l keeley jr in  although keeleyteton was a new registrant with the us securities and exchange commission on march   the investment philosophy staffing and chicago location will remain consistent with that of keeley asset management corp is now a whollyowned subsidiary the creation of keeleyteton advisors llc and the resulting combination with teton advisors inc has created a transformational combination of two wellestablished active asset managers as of february   the combined firms had  billion in assets under management aum the complementary investment teams at teton and keeley will seek to leverage the resources of both firms to the benefit of fund shareholders clients and stakeholders the investment teams at teton and keeleyteton will focus their research coverage across an expanded product suite including  mutual funds the teton westwood funds and the keeley funds and seven separate account strategies keeleyteton seeks to uncover the inefficiently priced stocks of excellent companies through fundamental research as active investors we focus on exploiting shortterm market distortions to generate longterm alpha its product offerings consist of two distinct complementary investment strategies  a restructuring strategy and a dividend strategy the restructuring strategy focuses on companies undergoing major corporate change which often involves events that act as catalysts and direct our research team toward attractive opportunities these types of events often share a common thread in that they create market inefficiencies where for a period of time there is littletono wall street research or sponsorship we believe it is precisely these inefficiencies that offer us a notable edge and allow our team to invest below our fair market value assessment specifically the keeley small cap value smallmid cap value and all cap value strategies represent the restructuring product offerings to complement this strategy keeleyteton also offers a dividend product to help investors who seek to minimize the volatility typically associated with small and midcap stocks in  and  we launched the keeley small cap dividend value fund and mid cap dividend value fund respectively to focus our bottomup research efforts on a unique universe of dividendpaying stocks with this approach investors access small and midcap dividend paying stocks which seek to minimize the volatility typically associated with these company sizes in challenging investment environments we believe the quality of our dividendfocused portfolios coupled with our attention to valuation offers downside market protection and capital preservation as an investment boutique our investment professionals share in the belief that being different is fundamental to discovering hidden value in equities our dedicated team is committed to serving clients from modest beginnings over  years ago to today the disciplined discovery of value™ shapes the cornerstone for our clients longterm success dedicated value investors for over three decades investors should carefully consider the investment objectives
