pharmaceuticals introducing stack overflow trends  stack overflow blog introducing stack overflow trends by david robinsonon may   on a typical day developers ask over  questions on stack overflow about programming problems they run into in their work which technologies are they asking about and how has that changed over time today we’re introducing the stack overflow trends tool to track interest in programming languages and technologies based on the number of stack overflow questions asked per month for example we could compare the relative usage of three programming languages here we can see that questions about the python programming language have become rapidly more common over the last few years in data from stack overflow talent we’ve seen the same expansion in companies looking for python developers php was growing for several years but has since leveled off perl was never as big a presence on stack overflow and questions about it have become steadily less common in the last  years measuring developer interest based on stack overflow questions isn’t perfect some technologies might inspire more questions among its users than others but we’ve found it’s a simple measure that gives useful insights into the developer ecosystem it’s especially useful for measuring changes over time when we see a rapid growth in the number of questions about a technology it usually reflects a real change in what developers are using and learning here we’ll share a few examples of insights we can extract from the stack overflow trends tool javascript frameworks javascript opensource web frameworks show some of the most interesting patterns of growth and decline jquery used to be among the most popular tags on stack overflow as some have humorously observed but it has made up a smaller share of questions as newer web frameworks have been introduced there’s been extraordinary growth of the angularjs tag representing the first version of the framework since  then a quick shift to the angular tag representing subsequent versions we also see fast growth in the react library these tags are among the most prominent javascript projects on the site smaller web frameworks show a brutal life cycle where some show rapid growth then decline over the span of a few years the vuejs framework have shown quick adoption and in terms of yearoveryear growth is one of the fastest growing tags on the site frameworks like backbonejs emberjs and more recently meteor appear to be in the later stages of the life cycle overall frontend web development has largely been moving away from closedsource plugins including adobe flash or the nowdeprecated microsoft silverlight in  these each made up less than  of stack overflow questions data science and big data technologies used for data science have shown particularly rapid growth over the last few years the r statistical programming language has shown consistent growth as has pandas a popular library for data science in python the closed source matlab language was growing for most of the lifetime of the site but has more recently leveled off and may be shrinking tensorflow google’s opensource machine learning framework was introduced only in late  but it’s been growing at an extraordinary pace among the  largest tags only swift has shown faster growth in the last year similarly there’s been expansion of interest in big data frameworks we can compare several major apache opensource projects for storing and processing large datasets hadoop has grown since  and so more recently has hive a query system built on top of hadoop interest in cassandra has remained steady for several years but spark shows the fastest surge of adoption becoming the most asked about technology just a few years after its introduction try it yourself don’t see your favorite language technology or framework in this post use the stack overflow trends tool to create your own graphs and see what you can learn about how the developer ecosystem is changing and where it might be going in the future by david robinson data scientist tagged in  announcements company data engineering hariram n the steep inclination in the r definitely does ring a bell a big fat church bell probably mike wise nice to see r is keeping up the growth pandas fans would have you believe otherwise instagram photos and videos tensorflow google’s opensource machine learning framework was introduced only in late  but it’s been growing at an extraordinary pace among the  largest tags only swift has shown faster growth in the last year marc köhlbrugge very cool i happened to make the same thing but for startup jobs httpsbetalistcomjobstrends jorge castro are the tags available only a subset i wasn’t able to add mesos for example david robinson yep only ones with at least  questions on stack overflow i’m afraid mike wise why is that out of curiosity seems harmless to allow anything david robinson first reason is performance the trends page doesn’t make any asynchronous calls it frontloads the permonth data currently  mb json dictionary and shrinking the tag size limit expands that size a lot we include about  tags here but there are k tags in total second reason is that a lot of rare tags look really crummy as line plots due to noise between months third reason is it makes the autosuggestion more useful try typing in “android” and you’ll see it suggests about  different tags now imagine that for almost anything you’re typing type “node” for nodejs and get nodemon nodeclipse nodetool and other obscure tags and most of the tags being uninformative when rendered this helps point users towards the tags that are worth graphing it’s not the only choice we could have made but i hope these reasons help explain it paintedgauthier php questions being asked is in decline but is the frequency of existing question views going down dm in addition to showing questions asked it might be good to show pageviews — ie people who googled a question and landed on the stackoverflow page and found their question answered bhatt bhaskar it will bring earth quake on every ones mind omar soufiane it looks a bit wired to see php loose share to python after php which is way faster than python fishy still not threaded though 😛 matteo italia i think that speed is one of the least interesting factors when choosing python over php besides it’s not like web development is the only kind development happening and outside it php is virtually nonexistant unlike python vasiliy stackoverflow keeps delighting us keep up the good work guys ps long live language wars supported by statistical data  basil mcdonnell as several others here suggest i think that the frequency of questions is an inaccurate measure of popularity the frequency of questions could reflect several factors other than popularity complexity version changes new user influx immaturity of the technology experienced users don’t ask as many questions so the user base for a technology could be vast but the experts who are current users will not be posting questions even page accesses don’t tell the whole story i very rarely if ever have to ask questions of anyone about systems i’ve used the longest but those systems are the backbone of my paying work for example a very experienced developer would have no occasion to post a transactsql question but sql server might be at the core of all of their work to score high on this questionsposted measure a technology would have to be complex it would have to be new it would have to be sufficiently complex to compel a user to seek outside help it would have to be complex enough to give rise to vast numbers of nonrepeated questions and so complex that even experts never become so comfortable with the tool that they stop asking questions as a technology matures the frequency of questions ought to drop page views ought to drop so i’d say that it’s a very very indirect measure of popularity adrocked backbone is still the only mv framework worth using svick it’s interesting that c has been declining steadily pretty much single the start httpsinsightsstackoverflowcomtrendstagsjavaccccbbcc is c actually losing popularity or is it because so was most popular among c programmers in the beginning bob i think that highlights that tracking ‘interest’ in these technologies by tag activity needs to be taken with a huge pinch of salt daniel crabtree i think that’s because all the c questions have already been asked and answered this really doesn’t track the “fall” of technologies i think it would be more insightful if there was a version of trends that tracked the number of page views per tag rather than questions asked oskar klintrot jon skeet answered all the most important questions the first six month 🙂 thomas andrews i don’t know the fact that a question has already been asked and answered doesn’t seem to prevent people from asking it again and again… mike wise it is an interesting point and a great idea i think having the option to see the results either for views and for questions would go a long way to helping validate this theory disqusfrpwjifdisqus – would this be possible does not sound hard… lundin the same trend is there for every traditional programming language these are probably not becoming less popular but they are a lower percentage of the total the likely explanation is that the smartphone explosion has led to a ton of questions taking up a significant share of the total therefore you can’t really use “percentage of so total” as a metric for popularity you’ll have to compare the language with the equivalent alternatives grant winney does the vertical metric represent the percentage of all stack overflow questions for a particular time period so could it be for example that jquery questions are holding completely steady monthtomonth hypothetically while the total number of questions in all other languages are going up and down in the same time period if that’s the case then the above metrics aren’t as indicative of language popularity as they might seem at first sumurai the graph does only display relative popularity of technologies if you can accept the premise that the community is and always has been a good representation of all developers then the graph does also display the popularity of a particular technology over time because if it is a fair subgroup of all developers the percentage of questions asked per month is the same percentage of all developers xiao ling thanks for sharing the trends tool laichuanfeng very cool tool thanks for sharing ryan sattler please make the graph in the generator go down to  instead of just the lowest point in the line right now it’s very misleading david robinson this has been fixed thanks bdlove com thanks sir … please any one help me to make a grabber script of httpwwwbdlovecom download site max awesome info that have sense to share with it giorgi moniava nice good tool harry mcintyre cool it would be nice to have absolute numbers rather than percentages also it would be interesting to see a count of views by tag – if you’re interested in popularity then questions that have already been asked and answered are interesting mike nakis this is awesome thanks now a plot which includes the c tag does not include all posts under the c or c tags right if so then what we now need is a way to hierarchically organize tags david forck this has been asked for several times they always tell us no… david robinson interestingly how tags could be organized hierarchically is a blog post i’ve been working recently it won’t end up as a feature but there’s a lot that can be found from “tag x usually appears on questions with tag y” eg python appearing with python dniel i’m one of the  of males who are colorblind when adding a third item to the graph its color is indistinguishable from the second item to me fin percy inspect the graph and change the colour each line is a separate element grant winney someone who’s colorblind should just change the color sure each line is separate but it must be kinda tough for him to match those lines to the legendtags tyler hibbard seems reasonable since we don’t know what colors a person can or can’t see giving them the option to change any color or measure’s color is the best fit cypress frankenfeld most people who are color blind have deuteranomaly you can easily test colors to see if they comply with this type and other types using a color filter tool destraui all you need do is change the “color” to “colour” then everyone can see it david m are you doing any work to address communities or languages that don’t use so or are moving away from it i know the delphi tag has dropped off dramatically in the past few years mostly because anecdotally of so culture lots of closed questions deleted questions etc – for that tag today people seem to use so as a readonly site instead of as an active resource you can verify this by comparing so trends vs other language tracking where delphi is decreasing here but increasing in popularity in real life i doubt it’s the only community to have this problem and it will be especially visible in small communities david robinson this is a worthwhile concern but why are you confident delphi is increasing in popularity in real life as a relative portion of the developer ecosystem in the last year delphi dropped seven ranks on the tiobe index httpswwwtiobecomtiobeindex and while i think the redmonk programming language rankings stopped including the delphi tag separately from pascal in  in the july  data httpsogradymediaredmonkcomsogradyfileslangrankqplotwmpng delphi was one of the technologies most overrepresented on stack overflow compared to  of github pull requests pascal was about even between the two metrics and stayed that way in  what other language trackers are you referring to david m i’m sure it has large communities elsewhere including nonenglish but the language itself isn’t a concern – it’s the so culture the question is are so addressing it peter mortensen re “at least  questions” couldn’t you grandfather some of the oldies in even with the noise like cobol and forth especially as cobol has been mentioned in some stack overflow podcast episodes destraui i agree peter though you have omitted rpg and rexx – heh heh i would have been interested in a chart like this when i used to ponder over the difference between an “ordered collection” and linux barton chittenden i wonder some about what’s measured here… people post more on a given tag on so when they have more questions about a given language that could indicate that the language is popular but it could also indicate that it’s confusing steven byrne could very well indicate that is undocumentedpoorly documented or new i don’t ask hardly any c questions because they have already been asked same for php whereas r and python  haven’t had as many answered although this changes quickly it could also be that the languages themselves have betterlesser support forums for instance power basic’s forums answer every question imaginable while php’s leave me frustrated and confused stanislav bashkyrtsev pretty sure people will start abusing these trends thinking that one frameworklanguage is better or more popular than the other don’t know how useful this is for programming society tyler hibbard i don’t know of any language wars that have actually caused a language to die so i doubt things would change even with the inclusion of “stack overflow trend” graphs it’s useful because it lets programmers escape the inherent myopia of their daily language or languages and provides them more perspective andrewjgrimm arrays are three times more popular now  than at the start  why is that more nbs does it mean i should be an array programmer will i get a raise if i do so mike quentel enjoy analysing these graphs–good work suggestion improve difference between each line of the graph especially when there are more than a few items this particular graph has colours that are difficult to differentiate httpsinsightsstackoverflowcomtrendsutmsourcesoownedutmmediumblogutmcampaigntrendsutmcontentbloglinktagsjavaccccbbcpythoncccvbnetcjavascriptcassemblycphpcperlcrubycvbcswiftcrc drake i think it is a interesting tool it would be nice to have the possibility to choose between number of questions rate and page views rate john how come i can’t do a trend on webassembly even though it is a tag archimedes trajano can you be mindful to those who are partially color blind on the graphs i had trouble distinguishing  react js vs angularjs  knockoutjsvs redux david marquez great tool would be even more useful if it supported negative queries for example tags java android would graph activity that has java but does not reference android as to separate oracle java versus android java activity david robinson that would be cool but would also be computationally infeasible for this approach here we just have a mapping of month  tag to percent and it’s kept clientside to include negative pairs you’d need to query the full set of questiontag pairs each time the stack exchange data explorer would let you create queries like this though httpsdatastackexchangecomstackoverflowqueries david marquez interesting thank you for sharing this info regards stefan to track interest in languages you should compare pageviews not asked questions more questions can rather prove that language is more confusingpoorly documented nkansah rexford i agree more pageviews might be close to what people are actually reading on than questions asked which means people are struggling with the language in one way or the other anupam jain excellent point but more pageviews may also indicate the same 🙂 rd so because a percentage is used then a surge in popularity in a widely used technology is going to make other technologies look like they are reducing in popularity even if their numbers are increasing albeit at a lower rate liam hughes just fyi remember correlation  causation httpsxkcdcom andreas beham one should be aware that measuring popularity based on questions asked underestimates mature technology with good documentation the hot new stuff with poor documentation naturally draws a lot of questions i think this should change in order to base it on the number of people talking about it rather than the pure number of questions asked if one person is asking  questions on some technology does that mean it’s more popular than  persons asking one question each kcarter i concur with this as it was first takeaway after getting past the geewiz initial glow of the tool the sampling is skewed against more mature and favors those that are more kinetic in their evolution the more stable a platform is the greater the likelihood that questions are resolved by the general consumers and therefore no need to ask questions in order to find necessary information it would be unscientific but i would love to see each of these charts contrasted against an actual survey of users while this inherently would be flawed due to bias and level of participation by the community it would prove to be an interesting comparison to make i don’t think it is appropriate to refer to this information as ‘indicating a trend’ as there simply isn’t sufficient quantitative data here to actually determine what is being used more than the next platform jeff brown fucken diseased eliran malka awesome stuff one question though why can’t i find some tags does the trends tool not supporting all of the site’s tags for example the ‘flowtype’ or the ‘jspm’ tags are available on the main site but not in the tool’s tag autocomplete field that makes it hard to compare equivalent technologies eg ‘typescript’ vs ‘flowtype’ sebastian cool would be nice to have some sharing options livinia this article is very cool and very informative i so know what is stack overflow trends thank you httpwwwlivicoid jerry liu cool adrian it seems many tags are not available in the trends tool for example i can see gdi but not gdi i can see c and c but not pascal i’m guessing there’s a minimal threshold of activity a tag must reach to be included what’s the cutoff carpeliam i’m curious to know this too i was really curious to see how alexa skills were doing but didn’t see any alexarelated tag options looks like sotagtrendscom works for these tags though… raphael how does this project relate to httpsotagtrendscom — at all rob mcdiarmid i wrote sotagtrendscom independently looks like stack overflow just had the exact same idea ilya ryzhenkov how about adding ides to the presets 😉 httpsinsightsstackoverflowcomtrendstagsintellijideaceclipsecvisualstudiocnetbeanscxcode alex angas i would love to cut this data by page views and also region manish hi can you add one more things into this analysis could you please q determine the phases for technology like emerginggrowingestablished decline can any body help me with ideas for same its big challenge
