merger  current operations  adv films partnership  references  external links historyedit nichimenedit beginning around  the japanese government promoted the development of cotton spinning as an initial means of developing modern industry in japan in the wake of the meiji restoration japans native raw cotton supply proved inadequate to meet demand and there was only one japanese importer of raw cotton at the time making the industry highly reliant on foreign merchants to improve this situation a group of spinning companies established japan cotton trading co ltd 本綿花 nippon menka kabushiki kaisha in osaka in  under the leadership of tsuneki sano a yearold former government official after the russojapanese war nichimen expanded its business from importing the company began cotton spinning operations in manchuria and established offices in china korea germany italy and the united kingdom to supply local markets in  nichimen opened a subsidiary in fort worth texas to enter the raw cotton trade in the united states world war i strained cotton supply in europe boosting nichimens international business further in the late s the company expanded into south america and africa trading in cotton as well as wool food products and machinery the great depression harmed nichimens cotton business spurring the companys diversification beyond cotton to trade in silk rayon and other materials during world war ii nichimen was tapped by the japanese military to manage production of flour matches and starch the company changed its name to nichimen enterprise nichimen jitsugyo in  to reflect its more diverse business the largest zaibatsu trading companies were dismantled after the war giving nichimen an early lead among the sogo shosha in the s and a six percent share of japanese foreign trade by  nichimen became closely affiliated with osakabased sanwa bank in  which financed all of nichimens domestic business nichimen was not the main trading company for the sanwa keiretsu as that position was already held by iwai  co nichimen jitsugyo renamed itself nichimen co ltd in  by  nichimen was trading in steel electronics motor vehicles and fibers in addition to textiles nichimen served as the joint venture partner for nabisco when it began operations in japan in the s nichimen co ltd changed its name to nichimen corporation in  nichimen like other sogo shosha was hit hard by the collapse of the japanese asset price bubble in the early s and subsequently made a strategic shift from the soft businesses of lumber food and chemicals trading to the hard businesses of machinery steel and construction nissho iwaiedit nissho iwai was formed in  by the merger of nissho company and iwai sangyo company nissho company was founded in kobe in  as suzuki  company under the leadership of iwajiro suzuki and naokichi kaneko suzuki was originally a sugar trading firm but later diversified into flour steel tobacco beer insurance shipping and shipbuilding it became the second japanese member of the baltic exchange in london iwai  company was founded as a steel trading firm in  and established a number of prominent group enterprises including daicel nisshin steel tokuyama soda kansai paint and fuji photo film it changed its name to iwai sangyo company in  both nissho and iwai emerged as metals and machinery trading companies after world war ii but were significantly smaller than the four largest sogo shosha competitors mitsubishi corporation mitsui  co itochu and marubeni iwai was poorly managed after the war and was on the brink of failure in the early s while nissho was profitable and successfully expanding overseas the japanese government directed the merger of the two companies in  forming the fifth largest trading company in japan falling back to sixth place in  behind sumitomo corporation sanwa bank played a role in the merger and the combined firm became the trading arm of the sanwa group keiretsu nissho iwai was involved in a corruption scandal in  after it passed on a  million yen bribe from mcdonnell douglas to the director general of the japan defense agency in an attempt to influence the sale of f phantom aircraft to the japan air selfdefense force in the wake of the scandal one nissho iwai executive committed suicide by jumping from the companys headquarters building the scandal was

the justice department has intervened for the second time in civil suits brought by aluminium bahrain bsc  known as alba  against its raw material suppliers and brokers last week the doj asked for a stay in albas suit against japanese trading company sojitz corp and its us subsidiary more than two years ago the justice department obtained a stay in albas civil suit against alcoa inc the doj said discovery in the cases could interfere with the governments own investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing by alcoa sojitz and other parties including possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act alba sued sojitz in december  filing a  million claim in federal court in houston the suit alleged that from  to  sojitz paid  million in bribes to two of albas employees in exchange for access to metals at belowmarket prices alba is majorityowned by the government of bahrain in march  alba sued alcoa inc its longtime raw materials supplier for corruption and fraud the suit in federal court in pittsburg alleged that alba paid  billion in overcharges during a year period the money according to the suit first went to overseas accounts controlled by alcoas agent londonbased victor dahdaleh and some was then used to bribe albas executives in return for supply contracts just weeks after alba sued alcoa the justice department intervened in the case it asked the court for a stay while the government investigates possible criminal violations of the fcpa and other laws by alcoa and its executives and agent the doj said the stay was needed to protect potential witnesses against civil discovery the court granted the stay which is still in effect the doj hasnt commented on the status of its criminal investigation alcoa denied wrongdoing and said it is cooperating sources with knowledge of the governments investigation have reported to the fcpa blog that the justice department had questions about alcoas initial explanations which may have delayed potential settlement talks alba did not oppose the dojs requests for stays in the alcoa and sojitz cases theres no private right of action under the foreign corrupt practices act so albas claims against alcoa and sojitz were based on other federal laws including rico  usc § c conspiracy to violate rico  usc § d fraud and civil conspiracy to defraud the complaint against sojitz alleged the japanese company used bribes to buy underpriced product and then resold the aluminum it bought from alba at belowmarket rates to us companies including enron corp alcoas conspiracy alba said in the civil complaint succeeded in
