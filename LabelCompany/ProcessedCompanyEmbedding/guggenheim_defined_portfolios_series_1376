which may include all market capitalizations mlp private placements and securities issued by mlps and companies in the energy sector such as warrants convertible bonds preferred securities corporate

in mlps of any market capitalization and of companies headquartered or incorporated in foreign countries security selection the sponsor has selected for the portfolio mlps closedend funds and an etf believed to have the best potential to achieve the trust s investment objective when selecting closedend funds for inclusion in this portfolio the sponsor looks at numerous factors these factors include but are not limited to  investment objective the sponsor favors closedend funds with a defined  investment summary investment objective and a history of adherence to those policies and objectives  premiumdiscount the sponsor favors closedend funds that trade at a discount to its net asset value and trade at wider discounts than peers and its own historical average discount  consistent dividend the sponsor favors closedend funds that have a history of paying a regular monthly quarterly semi or annual distribution  performance the sponsor favors closedend funds with a solid history of performance in relation to its benchmarks and peers and  liquidity the sponsor favors closed end funds with adequate daily trading liquidity when selecting the etf for inclusion in this portfolio the sponsor will seek to include an etf that tracks the alerian mlp infrastructure index currently this etf is the alerian mlp etf when selecting the etf the sponsor looks at numerous factors these factors include but are not limited to  liquidity the sponsor favors etfs with adequate daily trading liquidity and  yield the sponsor favors etfs with market yields consistent with the investment objective of the trust when selecting mlp equities for inclusion in this portfolio the sponsor looks at numerous factors these factors include but are not limited to  overlap with etf and underlying closedend fund holdings the sponsor seeks to minimize overlap between the mlp selections in relation to the underlying holdings of the etf and closedend funds  liquidity the sponsor favors mlps with adequate daily trading liquidity  yield the sponsor favors mlps with market yields consistent with the investment objective of the trust  consistent distribution growth the sponsor favors mlps with a history of consistent distribution growth  valuations the sponsor favors mlps trading at valuation levels inline or lower than peers as measured by operating earnings to price and  debt levels the sponsor favors mlps with lower overall debt levels in relation to earnings exchangetraded funds etfs are investment pools that hold securities etfs provide an efficient and relatively simple way to invest in that they offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day etfs are often built like an index fund but trade like a stock on an exchange etfs generally offer advantages similar to those found in index funds such as low operating costs performance designed to track an index the potential for high tax efficiency and consistent investment strategies unlike conventional mutual funds etfs normally issue and redeem shares on a continuous basis at their net asset value in large specified blocks of shares known as creation investment summary  units market makers large investors and institutions deal in creation units the trust will buy shares of the etf on the exchanges and will incur brokerage costs future trusts the sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same general investment strategy one such trust is expected to be available approximately three months after the initial date of deposit the inception date  and upon the trust s termination if these future trusts are available you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge each

objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are  investment summary not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the trust certain closedend funds held by the trust and the etf invest in mlps mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests limited partnership units or limited liability company units are traded on securities exchanges like shares of common stock currently most mlps operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors investments in mlp interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors including commodity pricing risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk the benefit the trust derives from its investment in mlps is largely dependent on their being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes as a partnership an mlp has no income tax liability at the entity level if as a result of a change in an mlp s business an mlp were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes such mlp would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the applicable corporate tax rate if an mlp was classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes the amount of cash available for distribution with respect to its units would be reduced and any such distributions received by the trust would be taxed entirely as dividend income if paid out of the earnings of the mlp therefore treatment of an mlp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would result in a material reduction in the aftertax return to the trust likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units of the trust the trust is concentrated in the energy sector and certain closed end funds and the etf held by the trust include securities issued by companies in the energy sector as a result the factors that impact the energy sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust companies in the energy sector are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels and can be impacted by international politics and conflicts including the unrest in iraq and hostilities in the middle east terrorist attacks the success of exploration projects reduced demand as a result of increases in energy efficiency and energy conservation natural disasters cleanup and litigation costs associated with environmental damage and extensive regulation certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in securities that are rated below investmentgrade and are considered to be junk securities below investmentgrade obligations are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks and accordingly the risk of nonpayment or default is higher than with investmentgrade securities in addition such securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early returns of principal investment summary  certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in securities that are rated as investmentgrade by only one rating agency as a result such splitrated securities may have more speculative characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than securities rated as investmentgrade by more than one rating agency the trust invests and certain closedend funds and the etf held by the trust may invest in securities issued by smallcapitalization andor midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments the trust includes closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies that invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue common shares that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including management s ability to meet the closedend fund s investment objective and to manage the closed end fund s portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change closedend funds are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset value closedend funds may also employ the use of leverage which increases risk and volatility instability in the auction rate preferred shares market may affect the volatility of closedend funds that use such instruments to provide leverage the trust includes an etf etfs are investment pools that hold other securities etfs are subject to various risks including management s ability to meet the fund s investment objective shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the underlying etf has management and operating expenses consequently you will bear not only your share of the trust s expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etf by investing in an etf the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etf the trust is subject to an etf s index correlation risk to the extent that an underlying etf is an index tracking etf index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the fund s target index known as tracking error this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances  investment summary the etf and closedend funds are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see fees and expenses for additional information the value of the fixedincome securities in the closedend funds or the etf will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes the trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates a closedend fund etf or an issuer of securities held by a closed end fund or etf may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments andor to declare distributions in the future may call a security before its stated maturity or may reduce the level of distributions declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units the financial condition of a closedend fund etf or an issuer of securities held by a closedend fund or etf may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period certain closedend funds or the etf held by the trust may invest in foreign securities investment in foreign securities presents additional risk foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as adverse economic currency political social or regulatory developments in a country including government seizure of assets excessive taxation limitations on the use or transfer of assets the lack of liquidity or regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing legal andor accounting standards certain closedend funds or the etf held by the trust may invest in securities issued by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk share prices dividend rates or distributions on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust there is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends or distributions in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time investment summary  inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a security s outlook market value or yield may have changed see investment risks in part a of the prospectus and risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information who should invest you should consider this investment if the trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio the trust is part of a longerterm investment strategy that may include investment in subsequent portfolios if available and the trust is combined with other investment vehicles to provide diversification of method to your overall portfolio you should not consider this investment if you are uncomfortable with the trust s investment strategy you are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities or you are seeking capital preservation as a primary investment objective fees and expenses the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect fees and expenses that you may incur based on a  unit price actual expenses may vary percentage of public amount per offering  investor fees price  invested initial sales fee paid on purchase    deferred sales

period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor  approximate annual fund  of public operating offering amount per expenses price   units trustee s fee   sponsor s supervisory fee evaluator s fee bookkeeping and administrative fee estimated other trust operating expenses  estimated acquired fund expenses  total    the initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the inception date because the initial sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee  cd fee  as described below the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred fees begin despite the variability of the initial sales fee each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee  investment summary  the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of  per unit on the last business day of october  and november  and  per unit on the last business day of december the percentage provided is based on a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period the entire deferred sales fee will be collected  the cd fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust the actual cd fee is  per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period which is expected to be approximately three months from the inception date the percentages provided are based on a  unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if the unit price exceeds  per unit the cd fee will be less than  of the public offering price if the unit price is less than  per unit the cd fee will exceed  of the public offering price however in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed  of a unitholder s initial investment  based on  units with a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date  the estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately  million because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected in some cases the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees  although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the closedend funds and etf held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated closedend fund and etf expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of closedend fund and etf shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the closedend funds and etf for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying closedend funds and etf were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain closed end funds and etf held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such closedend funds and etf will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such closedend funds and etf example this example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds in the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge the trust s operating expenses do not change and the trust s annual return is  your actual returns and expenses will vary based on these assumptions you would pay these expenses for every  you invest  year  years   years  years  these amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment the example does not consider any brokerage fees the trust pays or transaction fees that brokerdealers may charge for processing redemption requests see expenses of the trust in part b of the prospectus for additional information investment summary  trust

which may differ from the way the company is classified for investment purposes and portfolio diversification purposes  common stock of a master limited partnership  mlp  investment summary  understanding your investment how to buy units you can buy units of the trust on any business day by contacting your financial professional public offering prices of units are available daily on the internet at the unit price includes the value of the securities organization costs the maximum sales fee which includes an initial sales fee a deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee and cash and other net assets in the portfolio we often refer to the purchase price of units as the offer price or the public offering price we must receive your order to buy units prior to the close of the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time to give you the price for that day if we receive your order after this time you will receive the price computed on the next business day value of the securities the sponsor serves as the evaluator of the trust the evaluator  we cause the trustee to determine the value of the securities as of the close of the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open the evaluation time  pricing the securities the value of securities is generally determined by using the last sale price for securities traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market in some cases we will price a security based on the last asked or bid price in the overthecounter market or by using other recognized pricing methods we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate if applicable the trustee or its designee will value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their market prices if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate the trustee determined the initial prices of the securities shown in trust portfolio for the trust in this prospectus such prices were determined as described above at the close of the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later organization costs during the initial offering period part of your purchase price includes a per unit amount sufficient to reimburse us for some or all of the costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal documents legal fees federal and state registration fees the portfolio consulting fee if applicable and the initial fees and expenses of the trustee your trust will sell securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor organization costs will not exceed the estimate set forth under fees and expenses transactional sales fee you pay a fee when you buy units we refer to this fee as the transactional sales fee the transactional sales  understanding your investment fee has both an initial and a deferred component and is  of the public offering price based on a  unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the inception date because the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the cd fee the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the unit price varies the transactional sales fee does not include the cd fee which is described under expenses of the trust in part b of the prospectus and in fees and expenses in part a of the prospectus initial sales fee based on a  unit the initial sales fee is initially  of the public offering price the initial sales fee which you will pay at the time of purchase is equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee  of the public offering price and the sum of the maximum remaining deferred sales fees and the cd fee initially  per unit the dollar amount and percentage amount of the initial sales fee will vary over time deferred sales fee we defer payment of the rest of the transactional sales fee through the deferred sales fee  per unit you pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem units the trust may sell securities to meet the trust s obligations with respect to the deferred sales fee thus no assurance can be given that the trust will retain its present size and composition for any length of time in limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of unitholders the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales fee from the dates listed under fees and expenses reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the maximum sales fee you pay it is your financial professional s responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales fee and the cd fee are a fixed dollar amount per unit your trust must charge the deferred sales fee and the cd fee per unit regardless of any discounts however when you purchase units of the trust if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total maximum sales fee is less than the fixed dollar amount of the deferred sales fee and the cd fee the sponsor will credit you the difference between your maximum sales fee and the sum of the deferred sales fee and the cd fee at the time you buy units by providing you with additional units large purchases you can reduce your maximum sales fee by increasing the size of your investment investors who make large purchases are entitled to the following sales charge reductions sales charge reductions as a  of the public purchase amount offering price less than

qualify for the discount if you purchase units with these special cusip numbers you should be aware that you may have the distributions automatically reinvest into additional units of your trust or receive cash distributions we reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units not subject to the transactional sales fee by investors whose frequent trading activity we determine to be detrimental to your trust we as sponsor will receive and you will pay the cd fee see expenses of the trust in part b of the prospectus for additional information exchange or rollover option if you are buying units of the trust in the primary market with redemption or termination proceeds from any unit trust you may purchase units at  of the maximum public offering price which may include an upfront sales fee and a deferred sales fee to qualify for this sales charge reduction the termination or redemption proceeds being used to purchase units of the trust must be no more than  days old such purchases entitled to this sales charge reduction may be classified as rollover purchases an exchange or rollover is generally treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes see taxes in part b of

investment deferred sales fee that will be collected on such units at the time of reinvestment the dollar value of these units will fluctuate over time this discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary market see purchase redemption and pricing of units in part b of the prospectus for more information regarding buying units how we distribute units we sell units

calculate the volume concessions in addition dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units which are not subject to a transactional sales fee however such sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for volume concessions guggenheim funds reserves the right to modify or terminate the volume concession program at any time the sponsor may also pay to certain dealers an administrative fee for information or service used in connection with the distribution of trust units such amounts will be in addition to any concessions received for the sale of units in addition to the concessions described above the sponsor may pay additional compensation out of its own assets to brokerdealers that meet certain sales targets and that have agreed to provide services relating to the trust to their customers other compensation and benefits to broker dealers the sponsor at its own expense and out of its own profits may provide additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell shares of units of this trust and other guggenheim funds products this compensation understanding your investment  is intended to result in additional sales of guggenheim funds products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales a number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these additional amounts such factors may include but are not limited to the level or type of services provided by the intermediary the level or expected level of sales of guggenheim funds products by the intermediary or its agents the placing of guggenheim funds products on a preferred or recommended product list access to an intermediary s personnel and other factors the sponsor makes these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisers advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediary s representatives or offices obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the sponsor s products the sponsor may make such payments to many intermediaries that sell guggenheim funds products the sponsor may also make certain payments to or on behalf of intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales such as the costs of developing trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades payments of such additional compensation some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend a guggenheim funds product including the trust over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units we generally register units for sale in various states in the united states we do not register units for sale in any foreign country it is your financial professional s responsibility to make sure that units are registered or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy units in another country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units for example we lost the amount set forth in trust portfolio on the initial deposit of securities into the trust see purchase redemption and pricing of units in part b of the prospectus for additional information how to sell your units you can sell your units on any business day by contacting your financial professional or in some cases the trustee unit prices are available daily on the internet at or through your financial professional we often refer to the sale price of units as the liquidation price you pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem your units certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit redemptions or sale requests until the end of the initial offering period or six months after the inception date at the discretion of the sponsor the price at which the trustee will redeem units and the price at which the sponsor may repurchase units include  understanding your investment estimated organization costs after such period the amount paid will not include such estimated organization costs if units of the trust are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period the entire deferred sales fee will be collected selling units we do not intend to but may maintain a secondary market for units this means that if you want to sell your units we may buy them at the current price which is based on their net asset value we may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price our secondary market repurchase price is generally the same as the redemption price certain brokerdealers might also maintain a secondary market in units you should contact your financial professional for current unit prices to determine the best price available we may discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice even if we do not make a market you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any business day for the current price redeeming units you may also be able to redeem your units directly with the trustee the bank of new york mellon on any day the new york stock exchange is open the trustee must receive your completed redemption request prior to the close of the new york stock exchange for you to receive the unit price for a particular day for what constitutes a completed redemption request see purchase redemption and pricing of unitsredemption in part b of the prospectus if your request is received after that time or is incomplete in any way you will receive the next price computed after the trustee receives your completed request rather than contacting the trustee directly your financial professional may also be able to redeem your units by using the investors voluntary redemptions and sales ivors automated redemption service offered through depository trust company if you redeem your units the trustee will generally send you a payment for your units no later than three business days after it receives all necessary documentation at the sponsor s discretion certain redemptions may be made by an inkind distribution of the securities underlying the units in lieu of cash you can generally request an inkind distribution of the securities underlying your units if you own units worth at least  or you originally paid at least that amount for your units this option is generally available only for securities traded and held in the united states and is not available within  business days of the trust s termination we may modify or discontinue this option at any time without notice if you request an inkind distribution of the securities underlying units of your trust you will incur any distribution or service fees rule b fees applicable to those securities exchange option you may be able to exchange your units for units of other guggenheim funds unit trusts at a reduced sales fee you can contact your financial professional or guggenheim funds for more information about trusts currently available for exchanges before you exchange units you should read the prospectus carefully and understand the risks and fees you should then discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have changed whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences to qualify for a reduced sales fee you may need to meet certain criteria we may discontinue this option at any time for more complete information regarding selling or redeeming your units see purchase redemption and pricing of units in part b of the prospectus understanding your investment  distributions dividends your trust generally pays dividends from its net investment income if any along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the income distribution to the unitholders of the trust as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of each unitholder s pro rata share of the estimated net annual income distributions in the income account because income payments are not received by your trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders may be more or less than the amount credited to the income account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuation in the distributions from the income account the trustee is authorized in certain circumstances to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee shall be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the income account on the ensuing record date you can elect to reinvest distributions in additional units of your trust at no fee or receive distributions in cash you may change your election by contacting your financial professional or the trustee once you elect to participate in a reinvestment program the trustee will automatically reinvest your distributions into additional units at their net asset value three business days prior to the distribution date we waive the sales fee for reinvestments into units of your trust we cannot guarantee that units will always be available for reinvestment if units are unavailable you will receive cash distributions we may discontinue these options at any time without notice in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of principal pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose security is in your portfolio in addition your trust may pay a special distribution in order to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise tax on undistributed income in the trust the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends trust expenses change or as a result of changes in the trust s portfolio reinvest in your trust you can keep your money working by electing to reinvest your distributions in additional units of your trust the easiest way to do this is to have your financial professional purchase units with one of the reinvestment cusip numbers listed in the investment summary section of this prospectus you may also make or change your election by contacting your financial professional or the trustee this reinvestment option may be subject to availability or limitation by the brokerdealer or selling firm in certain circumstances brokerdealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment option at any time reports the trustee will send your financial professional a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trust s  understanding your investment activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available see administration of the trust in part b of the prospectus for additional information investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust recently equity markets have experienced significant volatility if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security in the trust the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value market value may be affected by a variety of factors including general securities markets movements changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector interest rates and inflation governmental policies and litigation and purchases and sales of securities by the trust even though we carefully supervise the portfolio you should remember that we do not manage the portfolio the trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund master limited partnership risk the trust certain closed end funds held by the trust and the etf invest in mlps mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests limited partnership units or limited liability company units are traded on securities exchanges like shares of common stock an mlp consists of a general partner and limited partners the general partner manages the partnership has an ownership stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive distribution the limited partners provide capital to the partnership have a limited if any role in the operation and management of the partnership and receive cash distributions the trust s investment in securities of mlps which are required to distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order to not be subject to entity level taxation often offer a yield advantage over other types of securities currently most mlps operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors investments in mlp interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors including commodity pricing risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk there are certain tax risks associated with mlps including the risk that us taxing authorities could challenge the trust s treatment for federal income tax purposes of the mlps in which the trust invests these tax risks and any adverse determination with respect thereto could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps andor the value of the trust s investments the benefit the trust derives from its investment in mlps is largely dependent on their understanding your investment  being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes as a partnership an mlp has no income tax liability at the entity level if as a result of a change in an mlp s business an mlp were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes such mlp would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the applicable corporate tax rate if an mlp was classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes the amount of cash available for distribution with respect to its units would be reduced and any such distributions received by the trust would be taxed entirely as dividend income if paid out of the earnings of the mlp therefore treatment of an mlp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would result in a material reduction in the aftertax return to the trust likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units of the trust energy sector risk the trust is concentrated in the energy sector and certain closedend funds and the etf held by the trust include securities issued by companies in the energy sector as a result the factors that impact the energy sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust companies in the energy sector include but are not limited to companies that explore for produce refine distribute or sell petroleum gas products or consumable fuels or provide parts or services to petroleum gas or consumable fuel companies companies in this sector are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels and can be impacted by international politics including the unrest in iraq and hostilities in the middle east terrorist attacks reduced demand as a result of increases in energy efficiency and energy conservation the success of exploration projects cleanup and litigation costs relating to oil spills and environmental damage and tax and other regulatory policies of various governments natural disasters such as the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico will also impact companies in the energy sector oil production and refining companies are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding air emissions and the disposal of hazardous materials in addition declines in us and russian crude oil production will likely lead to a greater world dependence on oil from opec nations which may result in more volatile oil prices smallcapitalization and midcapitalization company risk the trust includes and certain closedend funds and the etf held by the trust may include securities issued by smallcapitalization andor midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than largecapitalization companies these additional risks are due in part to the following factors smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new andor emerging technologies these technologies may be slow to develop or fail to develop altogether have less publicly available information lack management depth or experience be less liquid be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key personnel
