 includes entry card printers  and a data input touch sensitive registration screens  and a payment systems    a a a and performance mode selection utilized during operation of registration screens  and a special features that are preferably but not necessarily incorporated in booth  pertain to  equivalent recording conditions  registration  access  camera control  activation card  portal access and  prescription dispensation these features are discussed below equivalent recording conditions the quality of recording equipment can vary widely as can how the equipment is utilized computers can be used to alter the appearance of an individual the individuals voice the background scene in a recording etc an individual who is a mediocre singer can be made by an expert soundrecording engineer to sound impressive an important feature of the invention is to insure that equivalent recording conditions exist in each studio booth or location utilized and that an individuals performance is accurately albeit professionally recorded without significant touching up that alters the ture nature of and misrepresents the individuals performance for example  lighting light fixtures of equivalent quality are utilized in each studio booth or other location the fixtures in one booth produce light having wavelengths equivalent to fixtures in another booth the placement and intensity of light fixtures in one studio booth replicates or reproduces the light found in another studio booth  camera cameras of equivalent quality are utilized in each studio booth or other location  microphones microphones of equivalent quality and sensitivity are utilized in each booth  recording equipment the equipment utilized to record signals generated by cameras and microphones is of equivalent quality in each studio booth or location  background music even though a song an individual is singing during a recorded performance may vary the quality of the background music is relatively consistent and the volume of the background music with respect to the volume of the performers voice is the same in each studio booth or other location the volume of a performers voice andor background music may if desired be adjusted so that the volumes are substantially equivalent but if this is done it is done in an equivalent manner in each booth such a volume adjustment may be used if the performers voice is softer or is louder than the background or accompaniment music however other modifications of a recorded performance are not currently planned because it is desired to keep the recording of reach performance as accurate as possible if other modifications are selected they are carried out in an equivalent manner in each booth  background scene or âsetâ if there is a background provided behind the performerâfor example a picture of the skyline of new york cityâthe background in each studio booth is equivalent or of equivalent quality replicating in each booth equivalent recording conditions and avoiding or minimizing modifications of the recorded performance tends to give a fair representation of each performer registration since each studio booth is sized to be utilized by only one or a few individuals at a time to record a performance lines can form and waiting times can ensue before an individual can access a studio booth to make a recording the studio booth of the invention addresses this problem by preferably although not necessarily providing each booth with a plurality of registration stations so that two or more individuals can simultaneously register to utilize the booth in addition when an individual registers he is provided with an estimated time when the booth will be available this time is printed on an activation or entry card that is printed and provided to a customer when the customer registers further when each individual enters and activates a booth with his or her activation card described below an individual has a set time to record a performance and leave the booth by way of example and not limitation once an individual activates a booth the individual is given thirty seconds to prepare for a recording is given three minutes to make the recording and is given an additional thirty seconds to complete the session and exit the booth as the last thirty seconds of time expires the lights in the booth fade encouraging the user to exit the booth access when an individual is in a studio booth making a recording signage on the exterior of the booth will light and state âstudio in useâ ârecording in processâ âin useâ etc this signage will deter individuals from entering the booth while another individual is recording a performance the signage will not however stop everyone curious onlookers will be tempted to open the door to the booth to âtake a peekâ and can ruin a performance by opening the door importantly to prevent such an occurrence the access door on the booth automatically locks when the booth is activated with an activation card and can only be opened by the individuals in the booth alternatively the door can be provided with a lock that is only operable from inside the booth so that an individual can lock and unlock the door once the individual is inside the booth camera control the cameras in the studio booth can remain in a single stationary position as is the case in other prior art recording booths to enhance however the flexibility of the booth it is preferred that the camera be adjustable in at least two of  up and down along a vertical axis  rotationally about a vertical axis  back and forth along a first horizontal axis parallel to the ground and generally normal to an individual in the booth  rotationally about the first horizontal axis  back and forth along a second horizontal axis normal to the first horizontal axis  rotationally about the second horizontal axis  back and forth along or rotationally about another selected axis  focus or zoom and  aperture setting the camera utilized in the presently preferred embodiment of the invention is adjustable up and down along a vertical axis and the focus of the camera is adjustable a joy stick is utilized moving the joy stick toward and away from an individual in the booth adjusts the camera up and down along the vertical axis moving the joy stick from sidetoside adjusts the focus or zoom of the camera in fig  the camera is adjusted such that most of the individual in the booth is viewed by the camera  and is shown on display screen  and is consequently being recorded in fig  the camera is adjusted such that is has zoomed in on and enlarged a portion of the individual shown in fig  consequently it is the enlarged portion that is being recorded having the ability to zoom in on a portion of an individual is important in the practice of the invention because it facilitates certain performances like for example modeling when a model may want a closeup of her face and another shot which shows her from head to toe the zoom feature is also useful when an individual is conducting a video conference with a physician and the physician wishes to see for example a certain area on the individuals body activation card an important feature of the invention is that the system utilized to provide an individual both with means to enter and activate a studio booth and with contest rules and disclaimers once an individual registers and pays for right to enter the studio booth and record a performance a printer in the studio booth prints and dispenses an activation card of the general type illustrated in fig  the activation card prints the name of the individual sandi martin the session or performance number  assigned to the individual and informs the individual how the card is used to activate the individuals recording session once the individual enters the studio booth ie insert the card into the slot inside the studio the bar code or other activation code printed or formed on or in the activation card is read by the studio booth when the individual is in the booth and as is described below activate the booth for the individuals recording session the reverse side of the activation card illustrated in fig  sets forth the contest details including the deadline jul   for entering the contest the fact that there will be a winner where the winners name can be found the prizes awarded the winner  and an all expense paid trip a guideline as to how the individuals recording will be evaluated performance reviewed for at least one minute and a legal stipulations or conditions associated with the contest the guideline in fig  includes a contractual provision that notes that interscope records will own the individuals performance this provision can if desired be expanded to commit the individual to a exclusive agency contract with the operator of booth  or with any other desired individual or entity the exclusive agency contract can have any desired terms including for example the length of time the contract is in force financial terms etc an exclusive agency or other contract can be entered into by an individual at some time after the individual records a performance in a booth  this typically would be the case after an individual is named a winner in a talent contest modeling contest singing contest job application etc the following example is given by way of illustration and not limitation of the invention example a studio booth  is placed in a shopping center airport university campus or other public or nonpublic location at  noon an individual sees booth  and is initially attracted by the d projection  that is moving and appears to be suspended in space above the ground the subject matter of projections  varies at one instant the projection  is of a food or other item that many individuals buy or use or like for example a cocacola bottle an ice cream cone a dvd of a popular movie a likeness of a famous movie star etc in another instant the projection  consists of an advertisement like âbuy cocacolaâ or âfly american airlinesâ in another instant the projection  describes the booth âstudio one recordingâ the individual is attracted by the sight of an object apparently floating in space is attracted by the potential desirability of the object itself and is attracted by the continuing alteration of what is being projected by display  first a desirable object is displayed then an advertisement then a description of the booth itself the individual approaches the registration station on the right of door  and sees on touch screen  the âwelcomeâ information shown in the top illustration of screen  depicted in fig  three

another embodiment of the invention the performances used during a contest are not conducted in booths located in public venues or traffic areas but are conducted in a plurality of booths or studios located inside buildings in nonpublic areas or in areas where there is little or no public foot traffic such nonpublic recording studios still preferably utilize a uniform consistent set of recording variables an activation card and other components of the invention when an individual utilizes a booth  the charge for utilizing the booth can vary as desired it is however presently preferred that the cost be nominal to encourage a high volume use of booths  a presently preferred charge for a  minute recording session is  the studio booth as an access portal in a further embodiment of the invention the studio booths of the invention are utilized by individuals as portals to access a personal relationship service like a dating or matchmaking service to access an employment agency to access a medical facility like a hospital or physicians office or to access another desired service or organization as is illustrated in fig  an individual first utilizes a studio booth  to produced a recorded performance  by way of example and not limitation the performance can comprise the individual giving answers during an interview comprise a speech by the individual describing the individuals characteristics comprise the individual singing a song comprise the individual modeling or comprise the individual sitting for a still photograph such a recording is accomplished utilizing  the camera subroutine  and audiovisual subroutine  fig  to control the position and focus of the camera and possibly the microphones and lighting and to generate signals and recording data  defining the recording the recording is then transmitted by booth  to a job placement agency  to a personal relationships agency  to a medical facility or to another desired location  other required data or information typically is transmitted along with the recorded performance  such data can vary as desired but can byway of example include the individuals name address age phone number vocational interests email address resume likes and dislikes and hobbies or other areas of interest personality profile likes and dislikes with respect to the personality and interests of other individuals etc the job placement agency  personal relationships agency  or medical facility  then contacts the individual or viceversa to exchange additional information about the services provided the charges of the dating service or about the individual the use of the booth of the invention as an access portal appears to be a particularly advantageous way of enticing an individual to access a personal relationships service comprising a dating or match making service alternatively after an individual has made an initial contact with a job placement agency  personal relationships agency  medical facility  or other organization  the individual can subsequently produce in booth  a recorded performance  and have the booth  transmit the performance to the agency  or  medical facility  etc when booth  is utilized as an access portal to a dating or match making service one particular advantage of booth  is that it produces an accurate photographic record of the individual in the booth and as a result functions as an independent verification of the appearance of the individual this is important because one primary problem encountered by dating or matchmaking services is that pictures submitted by potential clients often do not fairly represent the actual appearance of the individual the studio booth as prescription dispensation station one particular embodiment of the invention comprises utilizing studio booth  to dispense prescriptions in the manner illustrated in fig  after an individual utilizes the booth  to conduct an audiovisual conference or audio conference with physician that is at a location remote from the individual the physician  can utilize a stylus  or other instrument to write and sign a prescription on a touch sensitive screen  any other desired equipment can be utilized by a physician  to prepare necessary data to define and transmit a prescription to a desired location the prescription along with any other information needed to print the prescription for example the name and address of the physicians practice is transmitted by a transceiver a at the remote location to the transceiver  in the studio  the transceiver  forwards the medical data  in the computer memory in booth  the computer control via printer subroutine  transmits the medical data to printer  in booth  to print the prescription a hard paper copy of the prescription is printed and dispensed by printer  in addition to dispensing a hard copy comprised of paper booth  can be equipped to dispense a hard copy comprising a dvd or other disc or media that can be utilized by the patient to print a prescription or that can read or otherwise utilized by a pharmacy to fill the prescription for the patient the dvd or disc or other media can be programmed such that the disc can be read only once andor can be used to print only one copy of the prescription alternatively the patients booth  or the physicians booth  can be located in or adjacent or near a retail or wholesale store that includes a pharmacy after an audiovisual or audio conference between the physician and patient the physician can transmit a prescription directly to the pharmacy in the store the patient can then when the patients booth is located in the store step out of the booth wait while his or her prescription is filled and then pickup the prescription from the pharmacy locating the booth  utilized by the patient in a store with a pharmacy is particularly advantageous because the patient can both carry out his conference with a physician and immediately have a prescription transmitted to the store the prescription can be transmitted to the pharmacy from the patients booth  or from the physicians booth  the prescription can be transmitted from a booth  to the pharmacy via wireless signals over a fiber optic line over an electrical wire via satellite etc one advantage of booth  is that during the individuals conference with a physician the camera transmits the patients picture and voice to the physician the camera can be adjusted to zoom in or transmit particular areas of the patients body or to view and transmit other information to the physician or other heath care professional the bar code or other identification code or system on or embedded in the prescription can be utilized to track prescriptions to help insure that they are legitimately issued on an as need basis to patients and to insure that the dispensation of habit forming and other drugs is monitored and controlled in one embodiment of the invention any prescription issued by a physician via booths  to a patient or directly to a pharmacy is also entered in a computer server accessible by the physician and by the pharmacy when a patient presents a prescription to a pharmacy or when the pharmacy receives a prescription via signals from a booth  computer equipment at the pharmacy reads the bar code on the prescription queries the computer server and confirms that the prescription has been issued the name of the attending physician the name of the patient and the drug to be issued under the prescription in some cases audio transmission between the patient in one booth  and the physician in another booth  may be sufficient so that a video transmission between the booths is not required it is presently preferred however the any audio transmission between a physician and a patient include a video feed such that the physician can see and at least to some extent evaluate the appearance of the patient the video conferencing feature of booth  can be utilized in conjunction with any of the other functions of booth  described herein for example when an individual is performing and also if desired recording the performance the performance may be viewed by another persons with whom the individual is conducting a video conference the other persons can be by way of example and not limitation a family member a talent scout a physician a modeling agency a personal relationship agency etc the remote studio booth as means for establishing ownership and confidentiality for performer one important feature that is preferably but not necessarily included in or associated with each remote recording booth is establishing ownership of a performer in a performance recorded in the booth and establishing control of confidentiality of the performance in the hands of the performer if a performer utilizes music or lyrics or a background picture or design that is provided in and by booth  but is protected under copyright law then the performer does not own all rights to his or her performance the performer can only own the rights to copy distribute and sell his or her performance if an appropriate copyright license or assignment is obtained from the owner of the music or lyrics or background design and as well from the owner of the recording studio based upon the owners copyright in recording engineering provided by the studio booth  addressing this problem is one important feature of the invention it is preferred that the studio owner assign or license his copyright interest to the performer and importantly agree to attend to payment of the necessary copyright licensing fees through ascap or other suitable copyright licensing agencies for the music lyrics or background picture utilized in the recording booth during the performance licensing by the studio owner from ascap etc of music lyrics and background pictures is preferably accomplished by the studio owner prior to a performer utilizing the remote recording booth further it is preferred that the studio booth owner agrees thatâaside from the music lyrics background picture and recording engineeringâthe performance is entirely owned by the performer still further it is preferred that the studio booth owner agrees that the performance is confidential and will not be distributed without the approval of the performer yet further it is preferred that if the performer agrees to have his or her performance transmitted to a remote location or to a web site owned by the studio owner or another individual the performance is maintained in confidence at said remote location until the performer authorizes distribution or viewing of the performance at the remote location yet still further if a performance is transmitted to a remote web site or other location and the performer elects to incorporate the performance in a personal web site comparable to the numerous âmy spaceâ web sites now existing on the internet the performer can still control confidentiality of the performance on his or her personal web site by limiting access to the personal web site the foregoing ownership and confidentiality provision are believed important factors in connection with the practicality of operating the remote studio booth if the copyright ownership is not addressed then it may be left to the performer to obtain the proper copyright licenses it is unlikely a performers would undertake or now how to undertake obtaining a copyright license this would mean that the performance violated copyright law and that the owner of the studio booth can be implicated in violating copyright law this would expose the performer and studio owner to a lawsuit in accordance with the invention the solution to this problem is to secure copyright license before a work is utilized in the studio booth andor for the studio owner to assign or license to the performer any copyright interest of the studio owner in the performance this problem does not appear to have been previously addressed fig  illustrates one possible confidentialityownership flowchart in connection with the use of a studio or recording booth of the invention in

preferably is granted control over when and where and if the performance is published or transmitted the user can elect in the booth or at another designated location remote from the booth to have the users performance  transmitted to a contest web site or server  or to the studio one web site  at web site  the performance can at the election of the user remain confidential  alternatively at the web site the user can access his or her performance  utilizing the user id code from the activation card and can amend  the confidentiality of the performance one way the user amends the confidentiality of the performance is to allow  public access to the performance another way the user amends the confidentiality of the performance is to allow  access by designated entities a further way the user amends the confidentiality of the performance is to incorporate  the performance is a separate users web site for access by designated parties the separate users web site can be operated on a server provided by studio one or can be operated elsewhere the user may elect to have the separate users web site accessed only by user or only by a limited number of other parties or by the public still another way the user amends the confidentiality of the performance is to allow  the performance to be utilized in a tv program dvd or other media distributed to a selected audiences fig

network with recording booth nexus in another important embodiment of the invention recording booth  is the nexus of a wide ranging network of nodes to promote or advertise a product or service the network can be described by the coined words âsuper networkâ because of the potentially vast size of the network and of the multitude of advertising opportunities that such a network could provide the network derives from and is driven by performances recorded in one or more booths  any company or companies could advertise on such a network in the following discussion however it is assumed that genesis is an internet search engine comparable to googleâ¢ and that genesis has purchased the sole right to advertise on the network it is also assumed that the company studio one is the owner and operator of each booth  and is the owneroperator of the studio one internet web site a preperformance network nodes potential preperformance nodes in the network are illustrated in fig  and include registration  at the studio one internet web site a virtual tour  of booth  at the studio one internet web site  registration  on site at the studio one booth  and promotional banner and screens  on the exterior of the booth  the manner in which genesis advertises at each node can vary as desired but the following examples are provided when an individual registers online at the internet web site of studio one the promotional message âpowered by genesisÂ®â can appear on menus or displays that appears on an individuals computer screen when the individual is registering fig  illustrates the first three menus which could appear when the individual is registering on the internet to utilize a studio one booth  when the individual begins the registration procedure on the internet the top menu in fig  appears this menu begins âwelcome to studio oneâ the individual causes the top menu to disappear and the next middle menu to appear by using hisher mouse to click on the âpress to startâ box the middle menu appears the middle menu includes the heading âchoose a sessionâ after the individual selects a session the individual causes the middle menu to disappear by using hisher mouse to click on the âcontinueâ box the middle menu disappears from the screen and the lower menu in fig  appears and so on during the registration process each of the menus includes advertising for genesis in the form of the promotional message âpowdered by genesisÂ®â advertising or promotional material of genesis can of course take any desired form in fig  the recording booth includes a traveling banner that extends around the top of the booth the promotional message âpowered by genesisÂ®â can as illustrated in fig  appear in the traveling banner other advertising for genesis can appear in other ones of the exterior displays or display screens on recording booth  when an individual is taking a virtual tour of the recording booth  at the studio one web site advertising material for genesis can be included in renditions of booth  of display screens of registration procedures etc b network nodes available during recordation of performance potential nodes in the network that are available during the recordation in booth  of a performance are illustrated in fig  and include activation card  and display screens inside the studio one booth  the manner in which genesis advertises at each such node can vary as desired but the following examples are provided the activation card can as illustrated in fig  include the promotional message âpowered by genesisÂ®â when the individual possessing the card inserts the card inside booth  it is likely that the individual will consciously or subconsciously view that promotional message display screens inside booth  can include genesis advertising material fig  illustrates a sequence of three menus that can appear when an individual is inside booth  to record a performance the top menu in fig  includes the heading âwelcomeâ after the individual follows the instructions set forth in the top menu and inserts her activation card the top menu disappears and the middle menu appears the middle menu includes the heading âsandi martinâ after sandi martin completes her performance the bottom menu in fig  appears this menu includes the heading âyour performance is

a menu or in any other display that appears on a screen or other area in booth  or in another network node c network nodes available postperformance fig  illustrates potential postperformance nodes in the network which arise after an individual has recorded a performance in a booth  these nodes include without limitation the studio one web site where an individual views his or her recorded performance  a mystudio personal web site hosted by studio one  a contest providers web sitelocation  a personal relationship web site  a medical facility web site  a pharmacy web site  an employment agency web site  the web site  of a friend or family member of the individual who records his or her performance in booth  a casino web sitelocation  and the web site of a potential employer  with respect to node  an individual visits the studio one web site after the individual has recorded a performance in booth  and has elected to have the performance transmitted to the studio one web site for viewing by the individual when the individual views his performance the promotional phrase âpowered by genesisÂ®â or other desired genesis advertising material can appear at the beginning of the performance or at any other desired location in the performance or in the studio one web site in one particular embodiment of the invention the promotional phrase âpowdered by genesisÂ®â or other desired advertising material travels along with the recorded performance so that whenever the performance is played or viewed said promotional phrase appears at least temporarily during the performance with respect to node  an individual may elect to have her or his own mystudio personal web site which can be used to communicate with others on the internet and on which the individual can incorporate any desired pictures music film clips etc the individual can store on his mystudio personal web site the performances that the individual recorded in booth  the promotional phrase âpowered by genesisÂ®â can appear on the personal web site can appear in the recorded performance etc with respect to node  when a performance recorded in booth  is received at the web site or other location of a contest provider to be viewed by the contest provider or the providers agent the promotional phrase âpowered by genesisÂ®â can travel along with and appear at least temporarily during viewing of the recorded performance similarly the promotional phrase âpowered by genesisÂ®â can travel along with and appear in the recorded performance when the recorded performance is viewed at a node  to  the personal relationship web site  can comprise a web site where individuals submit personal information in an attempt to find an individual to date to marry etc as earlier noted herein a recording booth  can serve as a portal to such a web site the booth  can be the âfirst stopâ for an individual in the sense that the individual can record a performance in booth  enter appropriate information and have the recorded performance and appropriate information transmitted to the personal relationship web site to register for the first time with the personal relationship web site  in another embodiment of the invention an individual has previously registered and established an account with the personal relationship web site  prior to utilizing booth  and a performance subsequently recorded in booth  is be transmitted to the personal relationship web site  for incorporation in the individuals previously established account when an individuals recorded performance is transmitted to a personal relationship web site it normally is with the understanding that the performance can be viewed by customers or other individuals accessing the web site  in an attempt to find an individual to date to marry etc when booth  is utilized for a real time video conference with another individual at a casino  at a hospital or pharmacy or other medical facility at an employment agency etc the video of the individual in booth  that is viewed by the individual at the casino medical facility etc can include typically in a fashion that does not interfere with conducting the video conference the byline âpowered by genesisÂ®â or can include other desired material advertising or promoting genesis when the performance recorded in booth  consists of a still photograph the byline âpowered by genesisÂ®â can be included at the bottom or on the rear of the photograph preferably in a fashion not to interfere with the desired effect of the photograph one preferred feature of the network of the invention is that it is likely that many of the nodes in the network and therefore the advertising associated with the nodes will be viewed by a great many individuals as is reflected in table i below table ipotential viewing audience of network nodesnodeaudience registration atperformersstudio one internet site virtual tour ofperformers publicstudio one

employees friends family membersfriends family members wet site of potentialemployers personnel departmentemployer the recording booths  and the performances recorded in the booths  are the glue that link together the various nodes in the network and create the network of the invention incorporating promotional material into the network produces a promotion network with an unusually large audience which promotional network can be particularly effective when the number of companies or individuals advertising on the network is limited although the number of advertisers on the network can be any desired number in one embodiment of the invention the number of advertisers is in the range of one to five preferably in the range of one to two and most preferably is one definition of performance format and integration of scenic environmental backdrop another important feature of the invention which would as is the case with other features of the invention herein standing alone significantly improve the commercial viability and practicality of using booth  is the system for formatting a performance the first step in formatting a performance is to define the kind of performance by placing it in a desired category that will include only a portion of performances recorded in booths  such categories can be defined as desired however the following is provided by way of example one category of performances can comprise all performances entered into a st contest consequently each performance for the st contest comprises one kind of performance a second category of performances can comprise all performances entered in a nd contest different from the st contest consequently each performance for the nd contest comprises a second kind of performance a third category of performances can comprise all performances for a still âfull bodyâ photo shot for a model consequently each still âfull bodyâ photo for a model comprises a third kind of performance a fourth category of performances can comprise family portrait consequently each family portrait comprises a fourth kind of performance a fifth category of performances can comprise an interview or other performance that is to be submitted to apply for a job consequently each performance that is to be submitted for a job comprises a fifth kind of performance a sixth category of performances can comprises a performance that is to be submitted to a personal relationship web site to advertise for a mate or date consequently each performance for a personal relationship web site comprises a sixth kind of performance once the kind of performance is defined the performance is further formatted by selecting at least one scenic environmental backdrop for that kind of performance the backdrop is selected by determining a selected geographical locale if any and by determining the desired makeup or content of the backdrop for example any performance that is to be submitted in a category comprising a st contest may require a specific backdrop that is associated with the geographical locale of hollywood calif and that has a desired content comprising a sound stage at a particular studio in hollywood any performance that is to be submitted in a category comprising a nd contest may require a specific backdrop that is associated with the geographical locale of hawaii and that has a desired content comprising a particular beach in hawaii as the desired makeup of the backdrop any performance that is to be submitted in a category comprising a full body shot of a model may not require any particular geographical locale and may require a desired content comprising a stage runway of the type utilized for models at a fashion show any performance to be submitted in a category comprising family portraits may not require any particular geographical locale and may require a simple white background as the desired content of the backdrop any performance to be submitted in a category comprising a job interview may not require any particular geographical locale and may require an office background with an american flag as the desired content of the backdrop once the desired content of the scenic backdrop is determined formatting of the performance is continued by preparing an analog or digital image of the backdrop this is typically accomplished by taking a photograph of the particular stage beach etc that is selected but can also be accomplished by designing a backdrop on a computer or by any other desired means after the image of the backdrop is prepared formatting of the performance is completed by storing for recall the image in a digital or analog or other format in one embodiment of the invention the image of the backdrop is stored digitally on tape etc at the website of the owner or operator of booth  and is transmitted to booth  when that particular backdrop image is selected for a particular kind of performance in the booth by an individuals in another embodiment of the invention the image of the backdrop is stored at booth  in memory in a graphics source computer  fig  or is stored at booth  in any other desired format when an individual utilizing booth  registers either at the booth  online at a web site or at another desired location a plurality of performance categories are provided from which the individual can select at least one category as noted by way of example and not limitation such categories can comprise a st contest nd contest full body model shot family portrait etc consequently when the individual selects a particular category the kind of performance is selected in one embodiment of the invention simply selecting the kind of performance can determine the scenic backdrop that will be utilized for example if an individual selects a contest the contest may require use of a scenic backdrop with a geographical locale in new york city and a desired makeup consisting of the skyline  of new york city and when the individual conducts his or her performance in booth  that performance automatically incorporates that particular backdrop  into the individuals performance in a further embodiment of the invention when backdrop  is recalled during an individuals performance then during the performance the backdrop  appears on screen  along with the individual  such that the individual can view both simultaneously in the manner illustrated in fig  in a further embodiment of the invention when an individual selects a kind of performance while registering to utilize a booth  the individual may be given the option of selecting a scenic backdrop from a list of two or more backdrops for example if the individual selects a performance which consists of the individual being photographed with a celebrity a list of possible celebrities appears the list may include for example paris hilton jennifer aniston and brad pitt the individual selects one celebrity from the list if the individual selects jennifer aniston then when the individuals performance begins a backdrop including a picture of jennifer aniston is utilized and preferably appears on screen  along with the individual so that the individual can position herself or himself with respect to the picture of jennifer aniston the integration of a scenic backdrop with an individuals performance is explained in more detail with reference to figs   and  for purposes of the remainder of the discussion with respect to figs   and  the name of the individual  is sandi martin when sandi registers to utilize booth  she selects a modeling contest the kind of performance required by the contest comprises a full body still shot the contest can if desired permit a contestant to select one kind of performance from a menu of two or more different kinds of performances and submit the selected performance to be judged in the contest against other kinds of performances that are noted on the menu and are submitted by other contestants the entity conducting the modeling contest earlier formatted sandis kind of performance by selecting and storing for recall a single backdrop  two or more backdrops could have if desired been selected and a contestant given the opportunity to select only one of the backdrops for the contest with a locale of new york city and a desired content consisting of a portion of the skyline of new york when sandi selects the modeling contest this backdrop is automatically designated and selected by the control system in booth  to be utilized in conjunction with sandis modeling performance the backdrop  is stored normally along with other different backdrops for other kinds of performances in graphics source  fig  during sandis  modeling performance in booth  she stands in front of and stands on a screen  in the manner illustrated in fig  screen  can be any desired colors and have any desired design for example the screen can comprise a wall with a vertical surface painted green or blue or another selected color or the screen can comprise a wall with a white vertical surface that appears green or blue or another color because a green light blue light etc is directed at the wall to illuminate the wall and make the wall appear green or blue in one important embodiment of the invention the screen comprises a âchroma keyâ screen the fabric or other material comprising such screens ordinarily has a green or blue or gray color the green and blue colored screens are typically more difficult to utilize because the lighting must be carefully adjusted to illuminate uniformly the entire screen the preferred âchroma keyâ screen is a chromatteâ¢ fabric screen produced by reflecmedia emea of road one winsford ind est winsford cheshire cw qq united kingdom wwwreflecmediacom the fabric comprising a chromatteâ¢ screen is in contrast to conventional blue and green colored materials gray a gray chromatteâ¢ fabric screen contains millions of tiny glass beads that act as reflectors and return light that emanates from a source toward the screen the light is reflected from the screen back toward the source of the light consequently if in fig  a ring of small green lights is placed adjacent and extends circumferentially around the lens of camera  light from the ring travels toward a screen  consisting of chromatteâ¢ fabric and is reflected from screen  back to the camera lens the screen  therefore appears to camera  to be green if light from the ring were blue the screen  would appear to the camera to be blue if light from the ring were orange the screen  would appear to the camera to be orange and so on a chromatteâ¢ fabric screen  produces a uniform green blue etc background behind an individual like sandi martin that is standing intermediate camera  and screen  as is illustrated in fig  the screen material preferably extends from the vertical wall behind sandi  and onto the horizontally oriented floor of booth  so that the floor beneath sandi  appears to have the same color as the wall behind sandi as is shown in fig  during sandis modeling performance camera  produces signals representing sandi  and the blue or green colored screen  behind sandi  these signals are transmitted to a key card  the signals from camera  can also include audio signals produced by a microphone that monitors speech singing etc by sandi  similarly signals representing the backdrop  selected for sandis performance are transmitted from graphics source  to key card  as noted earlier the backdrop  for sandis performance normally is selected when sandi registers to utilize a booth  to record one of her performances the backdrop  is selected by the control system in booth  either automatically as a result of the kind of performance selected by sandi or by sandi if a selection of two or more backdrops is offered sandi for a particular kind of performance key card  combines the signals from camera  and from graphics source  and transmits a composite signal to chroma key  processor processor  incorporates backdrop  to produce a chroma key still picture or audio visual signal that depicts backdrop  in all areas of the still picture or video that are not occupied by sandi the finalized chroma key still picture or audio visual signal can be transmitted directly to screen  for viewing by sandi  while she records her performance the finalized chroma key signal can also be transmitted to a recording system  or any other desired recipient or location for storage in the memory of system  and the finalized chroma key signal can be transmitted from system  and booth  to a selected recipient like the web site of the operator or owner of booth  the finalized chroma key signal is also transmitted to a dvd recorderwriter  in booth  that produces and dispenses a dvd  containing sandis performance the dvd  can be dispensed into a pickup tray at any desired location inside or outside of booth  but is presently dispensed into a pickup tray located on the exterior of booth  such that sandi has to exit booth  and walk on the exterior of booth  to the dvd pickup tray the foregoing paragraph describes process of sending signals from camera  and graphics source  to key card  of sending signals from card  to chroma key  processor of sending signals from processor  to system  of sending signals from system  to dvd recorderwriter  and of producing and dispensing a dvd importantly this entire process preferably happens automatically which is critical to producing and dispensing promptly a dvd of a performance just concluded by an individual inside booth  during a performance signals can continuously flow from camera  and source  through to recorderwriter  such that portions of the performance are being recorded and written on a dvd at the same time the remainder of the performance takes place and such that recording the last portion of the performance on the dvd occurs at about the same time or soon after the performance is completed or alternatively the performance can be stored at card  key  system  dvd recorderwriter  or another point along the processing path and only be written and recorded on a dvd after the entire performance is concluded minimizing the amount of time an individual spends in booth  is important in enhancing the commercial viability of booth  providing portrait and landscape picture outputs camera  is shown in more detail in figs  to  and includes fujinon sdtv lens  camera body  and rotary table  camera  moves vertically up and down along rail box  in the manner indicated by arrows  in fig  such vertical movement of camera  is controlled by an individual inside booth  using a joystick or another desired control unit the longitudinal axis of camera  is presently generally perpendicular to an individual  in booth  and to the vertically oriented portion of screen  if desired a system can be provided to tilt camera  upwardly in the manner indicated by arrow  in fig  or to tilt the camera downwardly so that longitudinal axis of the camera is at an angle with respect to the vertically oriented portion of screen  or to an individual  standing in booth  as is indicated by arrows  in fig  table  rotates lens  and body  through ninety degrees of travel between two operative positions in the first operative position camera  produces a âlandscapeâ picture of an individual standing inside booth  that is the type of picture shown in display screen  in fig  and that accordingly includes about  to  of the persons body since an individual controlling the vertical position of camera  normally wants to include his or her head in the picture what is depicted on screen  when camera  is in the first operative position typically comprises  to  of the persons body beginning with the head and extending a limited distance down the persons body when camera  is rotated ninety degrees from the first to the second operative position camera  produces a âportraitâ picture of the full body of an individual standing in booth  the picture produced by camera  would if transmitted direction to display screen  without processing appear in the manner depicted in fig  with the individual  horizontally oriented on her side in order to compensate for this software or other controls rotate by ninety degrees the picture produced by camera  this software or control can be located in key card  or chroma key  or at another location before the finalized chroma key signal is received and displayed by display screen  as a result when the full body picture reaches screen  and recording system  it is upright in the manner illustrated in fig  a mockup of an internet home page of the type that can be utilized by the owner or operator of one or more booths  is illustrated in fig  the studio one home page in fig  is operated in conventional manner by inserting if necessary required information and by then clicking on desired portions of the web page to go to the next associated web page for example in the lower left corner of the web page of fig  the words âactivation code â appear in an information box the user would use his mouse to click on the box and then use his or her keyboard to insert the activation number in the box after which he or she clicks on the âgoâ button to the right of the box to go to an area of the web site that would have his or her performance that was recorded in booth  in connection with the activation card for example if after she conducted and recorded her performance no  in a booth  sandi martin retained the activation card illustrated in fig  she would insert in the âactivation code â information box in fig  her activation number of xt fig  and with her mouse click on the âgoâ button to the right of the information box to go to an area of the web site that stored and would play her performance similarly in the lower left hand corner of the web page of fig  there are boxes containing âusernameâ and âpasswordâ sandi could type in these boxes her user name and password to access another portion of the web site which portion could comprise a âmystudioâ web site similar to my placeâ¢ or to other âpersonalâ web sites that permit individuals to list information about themselves and communicate with individuals at other similar web site as is illustrated in fig  once an individual utilizes an activation code to access a performance  that is at the studio one web site the individual can elect to transmit  the performance to the individuals personal mystudio web site in another embodiment of the invention after identifying  one or more ongoing contests or possible recipients at the studio one web site or another web site the individual can transmit  a performance to a contest or other recipient a performance stored at the studio one web site in order to enter such contests the studio one web site can agree to store for a selected limited period of time or for an indefinite period of time a performance conducted and recorded by an individual in a booth  in a further embodiment of the invention if the individual has a performance transmitted to and stored at his or her personal mystudio web site or to a personal web site of some other name then after identifying  one or more contests   or other potential recipients  the individual can transmit  the performance from his or her personal web site to selected contests or recipients for consideration by the contests or recipients in this manner the individual can utilize over and over a performance professionally recorded in a booth  this embodiment of the invention is important because the ability to use conveniently over and over a recorded performance helps to guarantee that the my studio web site  andor mystudio web site will continue to generate traffic visiting the web sites transmission of a live or delayed broadcast in a further embodiment of the invention illustrated in fig  audio and video of an interviewer at a remote location is received by the transceiver  of a studio booth and is displayed on the interior of the booth such that the video of the interviewer appears on a screen  inside the booth and a customer ie a performer inside the studio booth views screen  and hears the interviewer at the same time the cameramicrophone system inside the studio booth produces audio and video of the customer in the booth and transmits the same to a screen and audio speaker located adjacent the interviewer such that the interviewer can at the same time the customer is viewing and listening to the interviewer view and listen to the customer in this fashion the interviewer can conduct an interview of the customer the interview can be broadcast  to a plurality of remote television computer or other display screens    the broadcast can be accomplished via cable satellite etc utilizing fiber optic infrared or any other electromagnetic signals transmission of a performance to a cell phone or other remote mobile media player in another embodiment of the invention illustrated in fig  a performance  recorded in a studio booth  is transmitted via a transceiver  at in or adjacent the booth  the performance is sent via cable satellite cell phones transmission towers etc utilizing fiber optic infrared or any other electromagnetic signals the performance is transmitted to a cell phone or other remote mobile media player  to an internet web site  or to a receiver at another selected destination  transmission of a performance from a remote mobile media player to a studio booth in another embodiment of the invention illustrated in fig  a performance  is sent from a remote mobile media player  to a transceiver  in at or adjacent a studio booth  the performance is transmitted from player  via cable satellite cell phones transmission towers etc utilizing fiber optic infrared or any other electromagnetic signals the performance can also be transmitted to a web site  or to a processing location operated by the owner or operator of the booth  which owner in fig  is designated studio one selection of auxiliary sound accompaniment in studio booth in one embodiment of the invention illustrated in fig  a customer registering to use a studio booth  is provided with the option of selecting auxiliary sound effects fig  illustrates one of a variety of scenarios that can be provided a customer when the customer is registering to use the booth or is inside the booth ready to record a performance in fig  it is assumed that the customer is at a location outside the booth and is registering to use the booth to record a performance one location of the customer outside the booth is at one of the registration stations provided at the booth another possible location of the customer outside the booth is at the customers computer where he is registering at an internet web site to use the booth to record a performance in fig  during the registration process the customer is given the option in interactive screen display  to select a song after the customer selects a song and presses his finger against the display screen over âcontinueâ the next display  appears on the display screen display  gives the customer the option of selecting an auxiliary sound effect the customer makes a selection by pressing his finger over the box at the end of one or more of the selections shown on display  by way of example and not limitation the customer presses screen over the box preceding âapplause at the beginning of performanceâ and presses the screen over the box preceding âapplause at end of performanceâ after which he presses the screen over âcontinueâ to cause the next display  to appear on the screen display  permits the customer to if he wishes hear a preview of the sound effect after which the customer presses the screen over âcontinueâ to cause the next display to appear the illusion one of the advantages of the studio booth of the invention is that it produces a still photograph or video that realistically makes it appear that the customers ie performers utilizing the booth are not in the limited confines of the booth but instead are at a location having a scenic backdrop that is much larger and much different in appearance than the inside of the booth various features of the booth of the invention are critical in producing this illusion a restricted size of studio booth the studio booth occupies a spatial volume that fits within a footprint volume defined as bounded by a horizontally oriented polygonal footprint area on the floor or groundâthe footprint having a perimeterâand bounded by vertically oriented footprint planes that are normal to the ground and extend upwardly from each side of the footprint perimeter for example if the studio booth is shaped like a cube ten feet on a side the spatial volume occupied by the booth is ÃÃ cubic feet the footprint planes each extend upwardly to a height equivalent to the height of a studio booth the height of the booth can vary as desired the polygon is a simple convex polygon like a triangle rectangle including a square pentagon hexagon octagon etc the polygon has a width and has a length that is normal to the width at least either the length or width is measured along a line parallel to one side of the polygon the width and the length each span the complete distance from one side or point of the polygon to the other side or point of the polygon the studio booth fits within said footprint volume when substantially the entire spatial volume occupied by the studio booth fits within said footprint volume substantially the entire spatial volume of the studio booth fits within the footprint volume when at least ninetyfive percent of the total spatial volume occupied by the studio booth fits within the footprint volume in fig  the polygonal footprint area  comprises a hexagon having a width indicated by arrows  and a length indicated by arrows  the base  of a studio booth lies within the perimeter of hexagonal area  the portions not shown of the studio booth extending upwardly from base  do not extend laterally outwardly from base  consequently the entire volume of the studio booth lies within the footprint volume in fig  the polygonal footprint area  comprises a rectangle ie a square having a width indicated by arrows  and a length indicated by arrows  the base  of a studio booth lies within the perimeter of rectangular footprint area  the portions not shown of the studio booth extending upwardly from base  do not extend laterally outwardly from base  consequently the entire volume of the studio booth lies within the footprint volume in fig  the polygonal footprint area  comprises a triangle having a width indicated by arrows  and a length indicated by arrows  the base  of a studio booth lies within the perimeter of the polygonal triangle area  portions not shown of the studio booth extending upwardly from base extend laterally outwardly from base  the portions account for twenty percent of the total spatial volume occupied by the studio booth of the portions the extend laterally outwardly from base  half of the spatial volume of these portions extend outwardly past the vertical footprint planes that extend upwardly from the sides comprising the perimeter of triangular area  consequently ten percent of the volume of the studio booth extends outwardly past and away from the footprint volume this means that substantially the entire volume of the studio booth does not lie within the footprint volume if the width and height of each of the footprint areas in figs  to  is identical then base  of the studio booth of fig  fits within the footprint volume associated with the rectangular footprint area  but does not fit within the footprint volume associated with the triangular footprint area  of fig  as long as the spatial volume of the studio booth of fig  fits substantially in at least one footprint volume having a simple convex polygonal cross section with a prescribed width and length then the studio booth is deemed to fit in a footprint volume the fact that the spatial volume of a studio booth does not fit in one footprint volume having a polygonal cross section with the designated width and length is of no moment as long as the spatial volume of the booth fits into a differently shaped footprint volume having a polygonal cross section with the designated width and length in one preferred embodiment of the invention a studio booth lies substantially within a footprint volume in which the polygon is a square having sides each ten feet long being able to record a performance in such a small booth and to produce a realistic appearing illusion that the individual is in an area with a much larger background is difficult in another preferred embodiment of the invention the polygon utilized to determine a footprint volume can not have an excessively small width in comparison to the length of polygon otherwise utilizing a relatively small studio booth is impractical consequently the polygon should have dimensional parity dimensional parity requires the polygon to have a width that is not greatly different from the length of the polygon which means that in order for the polygon to have dimensional parity the ratio of the width of the polygon to the length of the polygon is in the range of  to  preferably  to  and most preferably  to  b subject perspective distortion since a performance by a customer ie performer in a studio booth is being photographed in a small space subject perspective distortion can inadvertently be easily achieved subject perspective distortion occurs when one portion of a performers body is sized out of proportion with respect to another portion of a performers body if for example the performers nose or face appears abnormally large with respect to the remainder of the performers body then subject perspective distortion has occurred in accordance with the invention one important step in minimizing subject perspective distortion is to define a minimum distance that a performer  must be from the camera  in the booth  in a booth constructed in accordance with the invention in particular in a booth that fits within a footprint volume in which the polygon is a rectangle having sides each ten feet long this minimum distance is indicated by arrows  in fig  and is equal to three feet another important step in minimizing subject perspective distortion pertains to the camera lens utilized in the practice of the invention while the field of view of the lens can vary as described the lens of camera  preferably has a horizontal field of view indicated by arrows  in fig  in the range of fiftytwo degrees to sixtysix degrees the field of view of a camera ordinarily is a function of three parameters  the dimensions of the film format or image sensor  the focal length of the photographic lens projecting the image and  the kind and degree of distortion of the lens if a lens projects rectilinear nonspatiallydistorted image the film format or image sensor dimensions completely define the angle of view for any given lens focal length field of view is usually measured one of three ways  horizontally from the left to right edge of the frame  vertically from the top to bottom of the frame  diagonally from one upper corner of the frame to its opposite lower corner lens are often referred to by terms that express their field of view  ultra wideangle lenses also know as fisheye lenses cover up to  degree or even wider in special cases  wideangle lenses generally cover between  and  degrees  normal or standard lenses generally cover between  and  degrees  telephoto lenses generally cover between  and  degrees  super telephoto lenses generally cover between eight degrees through less than one degree  zoom lenses are a special case wherein the focal length and hence angle of view of the lens can be altered mechanically without removing the lense from the camera c subjectbackground correlation distortion subjectbackground correlation distortion occurs when the spacing between the performers and background appears abnormal ie either too close together or to far apart andor the performer appears abnormally large or small with respect to the background for example if a recording produced in a studio booth shows a german shepard dog standing behind a performer and the dog is as tall as the performed then the performer appears abnormally small in comparison to the dog and there is subjectbackground correlation distortion or if a recording produced in a studio booth shows a performer standing on a beach in the ocean surf and it appears that there are several palm trees lined up one behind the other just behind the performer this is subjectbackground correlation distortion because even though it may be possible for palm trees to be growing onebehind the other on the beach close to the surf such is highly unlikely and looks abnormal one principal way of minimizing subjectbackground correlation distortion is to after selecting a scenic background that can be incorporated in a performance recorded in a studio booth actually viewing the scenic background in combination with a performer recorded in the booth to determine if the performerbackground combination looks normal when the performerbackground combination is viewed it is important to view the combination at a normal viewing distance of at least twelve inches away from the combination preferably a viewing distance in the range of twelve to twentyfour inches viewing a still photograph or video at an abnormal distance can make the photograph or video appear abnormal another way of minimizing subjectbackground correlation distortion is to preselect one or more backgrounds and require that a performer utilize one of the preselected backgrounds the preselected backgrounds typically but not necessarily are selected to correlate with or relate to a particular kind of performance or event for example if a performer is participating in a contest then the owners or operators of the contest can select backgrounds that relate to the contest if the contest is a singing contest the backgrounds may each consist of a stage or stage setting that makes it appear that the performer is singing on a stage in an auditorium if the performer is conducting an interview for a job the backgrounds selected may consist of a conference room setting or a restaurant settings a further way of minimizing subjectbackground correlation distortion and of minimizing subject distortion is to preselect a camera settings that must be used by a performer for example if a performer is participating in a singing contest then the owners or operators of the contest can select a camera lens setting or camera position the will show the entire body of a performer that is participating in the contest if a performer is participating in a modeling contest then the owners or operators of the contest can if desired select a camera setting that will only show the head and shoulders of a performer that is participating in the contest when a camera setting is preselected this setting can be imposed on a performer in any desired manner for example when a performer registers to record for a contest a performance in a studio booth the software utilized in the booth can automatically set the camera lens or other adjustable portion of the camera at the preselected setting and not permit the performer to adjust the camera or when a performer registers to record a performance the performer can utilize a touch screen that is located inside the booth to select one of two or more camera positions that are offered under contest rules once the performer selects a camera setting the control software in the booth functions to cause the camera to adjust itself to the selected setting or when a performer registers to record a performance the performer can adjust the camera setting from inside the booth but the booth control system will not allow the performer to record a performance until the performer adjusts the camera to a position that was preselected for the contest low resolution transmission immediately after soon after ie within thirty minutes preferably within fifteen minutes most preferably within five minutes following the conclusion of the performanceunless the performer elects at the booth to cancel or not transmit the performance or while a performance is recorded in a studio booth  the performance is initially transmitted to a web site owned by the owner or operator of the booth or is transmitted to another designated location this initial transmission typically is done is a low resolution format which format is less than  lines of horizontal resolution the performance is temporarily stored in computer memory at the booth in a high resolution format comprising  or more lines of horizontal resolution the performance is later transmitted typically at night if desired in a high resolution format the low resolutionhigh resolution transmission dichotomy is believed important to the practical and economical utilization of the invention because it facilitates the prompt transmission at likely a relatively low cost in a low resolution format typically during daytime or evening hours while preserving a high resolution format of the performance in the event such is needed twoway transmission of content the economic viability of a studio booth  constructed in accordance with the invention is enhanced because the booth  produces and transmits to selected locations remote from the booth  content in the form of performances by customer utilizing the booth while the booth  at the same time receives advertising and other content that is shown on video displays     on the exterior or interior of the booth andor that is heard audibly on speakers located on the exterior or interior of the booth evaluation of performance on the merits another embodiment of the invention enables a performer to request a substantive or other review of a performance for example in the middle menu entitled âchoose a sessionâ in fig  one of the selections offered could be â¡ have your performance evaluated if the performer makes this selection a subsequent menu or display allows the performer to enter a postal address email cell phone number etc to which the evaluation report is forwarded the report can be transmitted in a printed format or the evaluator can contact the performer directly and provide a verbal report if desired the performer can be asked to pay an additional fee for the evaluation the evaluation can take any desired form for example if the performer is singing the evaluation could comprise comments on  whether the performer remained on key  the âwarmthâ of the singers voice  the uniqueness of the singers voice  the singers diction  the singers hand motions  the singers clothing  the singers facial expressions  the singers hair style and if any makeup  the singers pacing of the song  how the singer ended the song  whether the singer conveyed a desirable mood having described the presently preferred embodiments and best mode of the invention in such terms as to enable those of skill in the art to understand and practice the invention Â  previous patent data recording method data editing
