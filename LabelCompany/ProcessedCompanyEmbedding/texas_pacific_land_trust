pacific tpl steven miller growth at reasonable price value dividend investing portfolio strategysteve miller inksummaryfinding intrinsic value for the trust is “tricky” at bestnevertheless charts show investors have established a range of prices they are willing to buy at over the past decadethe price target for the trust is the texas pacific land trust nysetpl is not your typical company it produces no products it provides no services its only real asset is land much of it dry arid and not very habitable the trust has been selling off that land since  yet it remains one of the largest land owners in texas it spends its cash primarily on buying and retiring sharescalled subsharesin addition to paying a very small dividend it is too small for most portfolio managers but it has been one of the hottest stocks on the market it could be had for  as recently as  and it hit  in  whats it really worth ask an investor what the stock is really worth and you will get a shrug donald hodges of hodge financial told business insider in august of  mathematically to me its just one of those stocks where you cant really say what its worth but you know its worth a lot and you just better hang on for the ride in a recent seeking alpha article eric sprague wrote in an understatement the tpl valuation is tricky in an even more recent article contributor antao echoed that he wrote tpl is a hard company to value he continued putting any meaningful price tag on the land is impossible part of the problem assessing the trusts value is that it is a passive seller of land sales of land totaled  in  the highest in the trusts history but were  the year before the income from land sales simply cannot be predicted year to year the largest source of income in recent years have been from pipeline easements sprague showed that these have risen from  in  to  in  then there was the announcement just last september from apache corporation nyseapa of a significant new discovery they call alpine high the trusts stock price which had just doubled went from under  to more than  in less than two months clearly the alpine high discovery is a game changer but no one knows what the game will look like once it has changed in his article antao showed a correlation between stock price and book value but some commenters argued that book value is the wrong metric the trust holds land that is given zero value but some of it is worth a good deal more than that the point is a fair one and yet the correlation in antaos charts remain i believe metrics such as book value over price and considerations of future value both have gravitational pulls on the stock price but in opposite directions whats an investor to do nearly everyone agrees the stock is intrinsically worth more than it is today but does that mean investors should buy in at any price today as of this writing the stock price has come down nearly  from its high of  i do not know of any investors who enjoy paying  extra for their shares and believe in waiting for a better price when it can be had what is a good price while antao was writing his article i was puzzling about alternate valuations of the stock in an effort to find a good price to buy in i started with evaluating free cash flow against enterprise valuefcfevover the period of a decade the results were similar to antaos comparison of book value at against market price the graph i created from the figures confirmed my suspicion that the stock was overvalued at the end of  when the price closed at  i tried projecting a ratio for  based on fcfev but cash flows being what they are for the company i had no confidence of projecting them i then used a tool from the value investors toolboxncav to market this might seem to be a rather unusual metric to use but consider that the calculation uses current assets which are known for the trust instead of total assets which is unknown in addition the trust has been aggressively retiring its shares and the stock price has rocketed over the past year the ncav to market takes both share count and stock price into account the calculation typically includes debt and preferred shares but since the trust has neither they can be disregarded the calculation becomes elegantly simple and similar to the calculation for pricebook value current assets  total liabilitiesshares  share price while the ratio spiked high in  it remained within trends in  even given the high market price to project the ncav for  i made the following assumptions i expect that the trust will continue to buy back its subshares it bought back  of its subshares in  and in  and so i projected  will be bought back in  current assets have been climbing since  and an incremental increase for  seemed appropriate there i further assumed total liabilities will remain flat compared to the prior year in keeping with trends in prior years finally if i project a price of  the ncav ratio continues to follow its pattern  has a little bit of technical support as well the stock price dropped to  last november after running up past  for the first time the month prior tpl data by ycharts based on historic pes and an adjusted fy eps of  antao wrote tpl is worth between  and  per share certificate finding support for  is difficult based on ncav but if i adjust my assumptions lower i can find support for  conclusion while using ncav to market to project a stock price is somewhat unorthodox it is also true that the trust is not exactly an orthodox company the stock probably has an intrinsic value of more than share but  is in line within range of investors have paid for the company over the past decade based on the ncav to market metric disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in tpl over the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship

business insider finance bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × one of the hottest stocks on the nyse is a company most of us have never heard of — and its got an incredible backstory aaron gell aug    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print business insiderskye gould the texas pacific land trust has traded under ticker symbol tpl since ticker tape was an emerging technology but at a time when billions of shares change hands every day and a highfrequency head start measured in milliseconds can be enough to game the system few on wall street have ever heard of it that’s their loss with a colorful history peopled with scheming robber barons corrupt politicians wildcat oilmen farsighted hedge funders and one rebel heiress tpl is currently outpacing  of the stocks traded on the new york stock exchange its operating margins are orbiting near the stratosphere around  compared with  for apple inc a share purchased in august  for  would today go for  — for an average annual growth rate of of  this year alone the stock is up  not bad compared with the increase of  we’ve seen in the dow jones industrial average which doesn’t include tpl during the same period business insider the trust is a highly atypical company and not only in terms of its financial performance it manufactures no products and provides no services it has never released a killer app or built a gamechanging innovation and it controls no patents it maintains no factories facilities equipment machinery or inventory nor does it carry any other meaningful expenses aside from eight employees occupying a modest thfloor suite in a bland office tower in dallas’ city center it has no competitors no liabilities and no debt its chief asset — land lots of land — is finite and tends to steadily reliably increase in value over time that is until someone figures out a way to suck out more oil at which point it goes bananas tpl’s only real goal is to maximize returns while gradually liquidating its assets “imagine the powerpoint presentation” muses louis geser chief analyst for white space marketing and an independent microcap analyst who began purchasing tpl when it was around  “you could list what this company does on one hand and it’s on autopilot” not exactly says david peterson the trusts ceo who along with his team is kept pretty busy making real estate deals and keeping an eye on the accounts receivable its not as sleepy as it once was thats for sure sir he says   land in west texas lara barrettshutterstock tpl’s assets aren’t much to look at just mile after dusty mile of bonedry mostly featureless desert and grassland studded with creosote and acacia shrubs stretching forever across the empty expanse of west texas the trust has its origins in  when the state of texas and the us government eager to spur the construction of the texas pacific railway proffered a massive land grant — or what some might call a giveaway with the land as collateral the railroad financed its construction by selling nearly  million in bonds to the public several years later it went bankrupt and in  it began liquidating parcels to satisfy those investors it’s been a very drawnout process “yep we’re going out of business” tpl’s former manager roy thomas joked in a  interview with the dallas morning news “it’s just taking us a while” what began as more than  million acres has now been pared down to  and peterson seems in no hurry to dispose of the rest “if the trustees were to receive an offer they would consider it” he tells business insider “in the meantime the race has started and we’re pointed in the direction of the finish line” he laughs “of course no one knows how far that finish line is exactly”    that’s just fine with tpl’s stockholders who tend to be among the most patient of investors donald hodges hodges capital the trust has a few sources of cash flow in addition to slowly liquidating its holdings — an acre here an acre there usually buildable parcels near towns or cities — it derives some modest income from grazing rights and wind farms receives surface damages from pipelines and other infrastructure and earns royalties from oil found in shale formations miles below the surface currently the latter revenue stream is by far the most lucrative due to the boom in fracking and other secondary recovery methods which have unleashed significant reserves in areas that were abandoned by big oil decades ago but even without that recent windfall tpl would be a highly appealing investment the trust spends its cash two different ways it distributes a small fraction to shareholders in the form of dividends at a current yield of  and it systematically repurchases and retires outstanding shares as a result there are fewer of those out there all the time donald hodges chairman of hodges capital which counts oilman turned financier t boone pickens among its clients has been in the stock for decades and currently owns more than  of the trust “mathematically to me it’s just one of those stocks where you can’t really say what it’s worth” hodges says “but you know it’s worth a lot and you just better hang on for the ride”   and then there was one a stock certificate from the texas pacific railway texaspacificrailwayorg back in  the new york times ran an article in its financial pages taking note of the texas pacific land trust’s novel approach to doing business even then it was clear that by canceling its liabilities more quickly than it disposed of its assets tpl represented a uniquely lucrative proposition for a patient investor “it has been possible by the sale of a small portion of the trust’s lands to buy for cancellation a much larger percentage of the outstanding certificates” the article explained noting that in just four years the float or outstanding shares had been reduced by  through the sale of just  of the land it was the times declared “the acme of financiering” nearly a century later in  hedge fund manager murray stahl came to a similar conclusion a “contrarian research report” released by his fund horizon asset management described a littleknown stock that was “slowly but steadily buying itself out of public ownership “although this process has been ongoing for over a century” the fund reported “it may now have reached a point at which this dynamic begins to naturally accelerate …” predicting that within a decade “the company’s assets could become concentrated in the hands of a few share owners” the report concluded that seeing as how the shares represented  million acres of texas land “the magnitude of this accumulation of pershare value could be extraordinary” the price of a share at that point was a reasonable  factor in subsequent stock splits and anyone who followed stahl’s counsel would have turned that  into  for an increase of  horizon now horizon kinetics took its report to heart while stahl and his colleagues declined to speak with business insider for this article public filings show that the company’s position in tpl is now around  million shares worth around  million the guy that ends up with the last shares is going to be a rich son of a gun  a full decade after that first report the stock underwent a notable adjustment losing a third of its value in just two months but when horizon released a followup report in  the fund was if anything more bullish describing the precipitous price drop as a win for stockholders because the cheaper the stock the faster the trust could repurchase the outstanding shares driving up the value of those that remained “if you’re a longterm shareholder you almost want the price to decline” notes eric marshall portfolio manager for hodges capital who has been tracking tpl for decades “the lower the stock price the more shares get bought back the more acres you own per share at the end” further as horizon pointed out the more shares the trust owns the less it has to pay out in dividends leaving still bigger piles of cash lying around to purchase more shares donald hodges who recently celebrated his th birthday puts it succinctly “the guy that ends up with the last shares is going to be a rich son of a gun” generally speaking he adds tpl’s business model is “about as good of an equation as i’ve seen since i’ve been in this business which is  years i haven’t found a negative to it yet” there is perhaps no company quite like it in the world “they don’t even have to be successful as a business” louis geser marvels “all they have to do is keep doing what they’ve been doing for  years” by that reading the mineral royalties that have been pouring into tpl’s bank accounts of late are just the slimy black icing on the cake oil has painted the sands of west texas more than once in the past century spawning corporate empires and political dynasties the bush family is one winners and losers and boom towns that blossom overnight then tip into a steep decline when the pump jacks start sputtering but fracking or no tpl has quietly been making its investors wealthy for more than a century all because of one big bet that went very very bad — back when the country was young capitalism was practiced with bareknuckled zeal oversight was virtually nonexistent and land seemed all but limitless   making tracks an anonymous drawing of a texan herd being driven to the railhead ap in the midth century the idea of building a railroad through texas and on to california was more than a compelling business proposition it would be “the greatest commercial achievement in art and science contributed by the intellect and enterprise of man upon the globe” in the words of one wellrespected commentator of the era listen closely and you can hear the same lofty utopian spirit that still sets pulses racing in todays silicon valley the ardent faith in the power of technology to bring people together and ultimately redeem them the railroad would as we say these days make the world a better place “it would form a connecting link between nations and peoples by affording communication between the continents islands rivers zones climates seas and gulfs” the writer went on “it would unite the old with the new the latin blood with the saxon the present with the future lift ignorance into the sphere of intelligence and power and give to the peoples of the world a new life full of prosperity and promise” it’s a familiar idea — deploying a disruptive new networking technology to make life easier increase communication and expand horizons in this case the new technology was a railroad the texas  pacific and the goal of the pitch was to persuade the government to help finance its construction a map of texas published by the tp  portal to texas history grandiose though the author’s language may sound today it reflects the spirit of the reconstruction era manifest destiny as the nation’s imperialist impulses were then earnestly called was still a heady bloodstirring notion for many americans the nation’s fragility had recently been illustrated by the devastating loss of  soldiers and an unknown number of civilians during the civil war which had only just ended a few years before it would form a connecting link between nations and peoples by affording communication between the continents islands rivers zones climates seas and gulfs  the executives of the texas  pacific railway were not ones to softpedal the scheme’s potential “prosperous communities of farmers and thriving towns inhabited by intelligent mechanics manufacturers and traders will spring up like magic” they promised “school houses and churches will everywhere adorn infant towns and incipient cities and civilization will take firm and permanent root in what is now but a wilderness” another contemporary advocate reeled off a long list of more practical benefits from promoting the settlement of the west and “intercourse with the indian tribes” to increasing frontier security facilitating military transport spurring trade with asia and bringing “the lights of american civilization to regions remote and hitherto involved in the darkness of pagan idolatry and imperial despotism” meanwhile failing to build the railroad its proponents warned could have dire consequences including the possible secession of california and oregon “who can doubt that a new republic will grow up on the shores of the pacific which would perhaps … obtain supremacy of its own” one observer suggested ominously texaspacificrailwayorg the railroad’s partisans marshaled another argument to pry more subsidies out of the texas legislature and the us congress — and it too has echoes in today’s tech industry a southern route to the pacific was needed to counteract the monopoly that had sprung up to the north where the central and union pacific railroads had created a stranglehold on interstate commerce and transport this rationale was an especially compelling one for southerners still reeling economically from the war not to mention the new labor costs brought about by the abolition of slavery and eager to wrest their fates from the clutches of northern robber barons so what if getting the railroad built meant a massive transfer of the public domain into private hands “it was worth  cents an acre” louis geser says “there wasn’t seismic data on the property no one knew there was oil in tight seams that could be accessed  years later by fracking it was just an asset to give away to incent people to build a railroad to move goods” the texas  pacific railway tp which received its congressional charter in  wasn’t the first effort to build a railroad across texas one attempt which brought its backers  million acres of texas state lands ended in failure with just six miles of railway completed the property was turned over to a receiver eventually becoming the basis of tp’s land grant in exchange for building the portion of the railroad that would connect texas to san diego — passing through new mexico arizona and california — congress kicked in  million more acres in those territories and tp’s acquisition of two smaller texas railroads added many millions on top of that col thomas scott wikimedia commons by  the tp — under the able leadership of col thomas a scott also a vice president of the powerful pennsylvania railroad and a wouldbe robber baron himself — had cobbled together one of the most impressive land grants in history larger than the state of massachusetts the land was considerably more than was necessary to situate the railroad tracks intentionally so the idea was to sell it off piecemeal to settlers to finance construction such subsidies were all the rage in those days in total as much as  percent of the country was handed over to railroads and other interests a gilded age freeforall that the pulitzer prizewinning historian vernon louis parrington dubbed “the great barbecue” — a grand banquet laid out by the federal government at which the nation’s wealthiest citizens made gluttons of themselves “congress had rich gifts to bestow” parrington wrote in  “the eating and drinking went on … until only the great carcasses were left then at last came the reckoning when the bill was sent in to the american people the farmers discovered they had been put off with the giblets while the capitalists were consuming the turkey” still tp’s generous helping was not secured without considerable lobbying logrolling and probably outright theft as detailed in “reunion and reaction” by the late yale historian c vann woodward one scheme engineered by scott and his colleagues involved the creation of a construction company — its primary stockholders consisting of themselves their cronies and it was alleged numerous members of congress — which was then handed all the railroad’s construction contracts a sweetheart deal with guaranteed profits still the land grants came with conditions work would have to be completed on a set timetable or the property would be returned to the public domain mindful of its deadlines tp quickly set to work selling bonds and laying track in an early annual report scott assured bondholders that the board “saw no reason why the entire line shall not be finished within a period of five years”   the end of the line longview railroad workers c  longview public library longview texas obstacles began piling up almost immediately first an untimely lack of rainfall rendered the red river impassable which meant supplies had to be hauled overland then in the spring of  the workers were beset by an epidemic of yellow fever most devastating of all was the stock market panic of  when the bank jay cooke  co went under taking the whole us economy — as well as many european economies — with it and contributing to a “great depression” that lasted years scott by this time known as the railroad king sought extensions and further government subsidies using every means at his disposal from providing elected officials with free passage on the various lines under his control to initiating a lobbying campaign so aggressive it raised eyebrows in the media “of course there are the pamphlets printed and dinners eaten and the usual consumption of champagne” the times wrote when one massive tp bailout came up for a vote “congressmen are classified as an entomologist arranges his bugs before pinning them in frames … and any senator or representative who ventures to question the claim of mr thomas scott to receive this subsidy … is at once argued with cajoled threatened or persuaded” despite these efforts scott’s entreaties met with increasing skepticism one bid for a time extension in  turned into a scandal when a whistleblower named james a george submitted a letter to a house committee accusing tp officials of having committed “bribery and fraud” in procuring its original charter promising documentary proof he alleged that the company’s executives had paid “over  members of congress” a total of nearly  for their votes the evidence was never forthcoming and a few years later a house member claimed to have paid george  a relative bargain “to keep his mouth shut” regardless of whether george’s claim had any basis in fact there is little doubt that fraud and corruption were par for the course in the late th century and beyond “those sorts of charges appeared constantly and they were probably all true” says randolf campbell professor of history at the university of north texas “in that age anything went these guys were all such wheelerdealers it’s just astonishing the sort of shenanigans they got away with” railroad tycoon jay gould ap because of tp’s failure to build the requisite track even after a fiveyearextension the company was forced to relinquish the  million acres granted by the federal government in new mexico arizona and california — but not before its leaders cooked up a deal to transfer the property to the californiabased southern pacific railroad which in the meantime had managed to lay down track from san diego to texas along the same route the tp once hoped to use the deal would have been the new york times declared in a  editorial “one of the most audacious swindles ever attempted upon the government of the united states” scott had meanwhile been replaced by jay gould the widely reviled railroad tycoon and stock speculator who had managed to complete the texas portion of the tp securing much of the land grant originally offered by the state of texas alas as the tp’s empty rail cars began rattling across the mostly uninhabited scrub land of west texas it quickly became evident that for the time being at least the “prosperous communities of farmers” promised by the railroad’s founders had failed to materialize   a hard row to hoe crewmen and spectators beside crushed locomotives near jefferson texas in  portal to texas history the southern pacific scheme was eventually thwarted and tp’s subsequent return of more than  million federal acres to the public domain goes down as the largest land grant forfeiture in history but the railroad was still left more than  million texas acres to play with when it went belly up and was forced into receivership in a reorganization plan shares in the trust valued at  each were issued in exchange for the original railroad bonds each stock certificate represented  shares — and a board of trustees set about liquidating the land doing so proved difficult at least initially despite the tp’s aggressive sales pitch to settlers a decade before — when it promised that “those who earliest avail themselves of the unrivaled advantages of cheap lands and eligible situations will of course reap the largest reward” — immigrants who took the bait were met with dire challenges the greatgrandparents of president lyndon b johnson were among those early texas settlers in the biography “ the path to power ” robert a caro chronicled how within just a few years poor management of livestock and an ignorance of the science of crop rotation quickly  transformed what appeared to be a fertile arcadia into an unforgiving desert   “it had taken centuries to create the richness of the hill country” caro wrote “in two decades or three after man came into it the richness was gone … on their arrival the landscape was covered with grass but as the planting seasons went by farmers and cattlemen realized that under a small layer of rich soil “it was a land of stone  and the implications of that fact had become clear” as word got out tpl ran into difficulty selling off its holdings — a circumstance that would prove auspicious to those who held onto their stock certificates at that very moment it just so happened german inventor karl benz was perfecting the gasolinepowered automobile and within a few decades oil would begin gushing from that barren “land of stone” making a lot of texans very wealthy   the case of the missing stock certificate alice de lamar age  new york social diary sometime in the waning days of the th century as the texas  pacific railroad bonds were being converted into shares in the land trust one of the stock certificates went missing this was certificate no  in the ensuing decades as its value ballooned the missing certificate became the subject of several lawsuits on behalf of heirs of the longdefunct new york brokerage firm that had handled the transaction as max hensley president of the international bond and share society recounted in the journal scripophily the tale of the lost certificate became legendary “the story appeared in reader’s digest and constituted a whole radio program by art linkletter” he wrote “needless to say all this pot stirring yielded a fine cornucopia of crackpots and delusional hopefuls” courts continually ruled in favor of the trust however and for years the shares went unclaimed and the annual dividends were placed in escrow but in the mid s one jack lewin a retired chicago trade magazine editor with a penchant for digging through dusty library boxes to track down old stock certificates for  apiece and a  cut of whatever proceeds he could recover developed an obsessive interest in no  it eventually turned up in the archives of the wells fargo bank where it had sat moldering for  years the stock it soon transpired had been given to the dutch mining industrialist joseph raphael de lamar in consideration of a  loan he’d made to a man named joseph decker originally valued at  the certificate didn’t even cover the balance de lamar was an interesting character born in holland he stowed away on a merchant ship as a boy eventually becoming a sea captain and making his first of several fortunes salvaging shipwrecks in later years he entered the mining business but his use of cyanide to mine gold although wildly effective was also devastating to the health of his employees many of de lamar’s miners lasted only a year on the job before succumbing to silicosis from the “deadly delamar dust” as it was called according to historian arthur h clark as many as  men gave their lives to create de lamar’s mining fortune the joseph rafael de lamar house in new york now the polish consulate wikipedia some of the fruits of that sacrifice can still be seen at th and madison avenue in new york where de lamar erected a beauxarts mansion one of the most opulent in the city for his beloved daughter alice it now serves as the polish consulate when joseph died in  leaving alice half of his  million fortune the society press was breathless with speculation about her romantic life but alice ditched the madison avenue residence along with a palatial estate in glen cove long island she spurned her various aristocratic suitors and seemed embarrassed by her vast fortune perhaps she had an inkling of where it came from leading one newspaper to dub her “the girl who can’t get away from her millions” in later years she became a patron of the arts and a friend to ernest hemingway paul cadmus benny goodman hubert de givenchy and many other of the day’s most prominent cultural figures eventually jack lewin tracked her down in palm beach where the yearold society doyenne and gallery owner lived with her longtime lover the actress and theater producer eva le gallienne in a spanishstyle beachfront estate by then certificate no  was worth  million half of which went to charity per joseph’s wishes for alice who had no surviving relatives the unexpected windfall was most likely a meaningless addition to an accursed inheritance she never wanted in the first place its not known whether lewin collected any of his anticipated  commission   going back for seconds an oil jack pump sits near the permian high school football stadium ap the permian basin a massive oil formation in west texas and southeastern new mexico was first drilled in the twenties not long after joseph de lamar’s death before long shares of tpl exploded becoming for a time the highest priced securities listed on the nyse by  the reserves were tapped out — or they might as well have been there was more oil down there nobody doubted that but amid a worldwide glut it was too hard to reach and too costly to mess with big oil producers packed up and made for greener pastures — the north sea the gulf of mexico west africa south america pumps were capped oilfield workers drifted into other lines of work if they could find work at all and former boom towns like midland and odessa took on a haunted cast their rusting derricks standing as forlorn monuments to a swaggering era for two decades tpl stock never crept past    cruise down the once empty i between midland and odessa today and — well you can’t the lines of wideload semis and oil tankers mercedes glclass suvs and jackedup denalis stretch for miles traffic accidents are routine with an average of one fatality per week housing is impossible to come by unless you want to bunk in a “man camp” years after the membersonly petroleum club became a hangout for oldtimers reliving the glories of the the s oil embargo there’s now a wait for lunchtime tables per capita income in midland is second in the nation new “breastaurants” are opening their doors chalk it up to the development of hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling there are more rigs operating in the permian basin today than there were when jr ewing took two bullets to the gut by some estimates as many as  billion barrels of oil are sitting down there trapped between the layers of shale — more than they have in kuwait and texas pacific land trust still has the title to a great big chunk of it and perpetual mineral rights to a good bit more which explains why its stock price is on such a steep uphill ride so why hasn’t anyone heard of it there are more rigs operating in the permian basin today than there were when jr ewing took two bullets to the gut “that’s what i love about it” donald hodges says “it’s under the radar if you asked  investors i’d be surprised if  knew about it it’s not a candidate for any investment banking it doesn’t owe any money it’s being ignored by the wall street industry” “when the receptionist told me a journalist was calling” eric marshall tells business insider “i thought you might have the symbol wrong” ultimately tpl is just too difficult to classify and too small for most portfolio managers to take notice of it doesn’t appear on any stock index and only  shares change hands per day on average “you can find the most beautiful collector’s item in the world” louis geser observes “but if you’re a portfolio manager and you can’t take a meaningful position in it why bother” of course that still leaves plenty of room for individual investors at this point only one factor might emerge to slow tpl’s rise and that’s this little thing called climate change whether the frackers will actually manage to blast all that oil out of the ground before carbon taxes and new regulations turn it into a “stranded asset” — or elon musk consigns karl benz’s combustion engine to the scrap yard of history — is a question that probably doesn’t get asked a lot around the petroleum club not that the possibility worries tpl’s fans land in texas will always have some
