issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement simple website flaw exposed data of charter internet customersthe data of thousands of customers was vulnerable to a website hack according to a researcher who spoke with fast company photo flickr user mrhayataby daniel stuckey minute reada security flaw discovered in the website of charter communications a cable and internet provider active in  states may have exposed the personal account details of its customersadvertisementsecurity researcher eric taylor discovered the cable provider’s vulnerability as part of his research and demonstrated how a simple header modification performed with a browser plugin could reveal details about charter’s internet subscribers after fast company notified charter of the issue the company said it had installed a fix within hoursthe vulnerability could reveal personal information of “millions” of the company’s subscribers claimed taylor chief information officer for cinder an internet startup but a spokesperson for charter told fast company that “the vast majority of charter customers use a version of the site on which this security vulnerability was not an issue” and that the number of customers affected was less than one million the company is auditing its systems he said and has so far “seen no evidence of any password or data hacks” the exposed data did not include credit card numberstaylor  discovered the issue with his colleague blake welsh after recently finding a similar vulnerability in verizon’s online customer service system luckily for verizon he said that flaw “only exposed user ids phone numbers and device names” but the amount of user information exposed in charter’s case taylor said was “way way way more”sensitive account information exposed by the simple hack includes payment details modem serial numbers device names account numbers home addresses and morewith  million residential internet customers connecticutbased charter is the nation’s fourthlargest cable operator the company announced monday it’s going through with a  billion deal to acquire si newhouse jr’s syracuse nybased bright house networks the nation’s sixthlargest cable company the deal will expand charter’s customer base by more than  million bumping its rank to the thirdlargest cable operator in the countryhow a hacker could impersonate subscriberscharter’s site identified its customers through their ip addresses akin to the way automated customer support hotlines identify customers by their phone numbers when they call thus obtaining a subscriber’s ip address is all an attacker would need to see their account details ip addresses are the unique numbers for all internetconnected devices and applications and are increasingly easy to gatheradvertisementusing a lightweight addon for firefox to modify http headers called “xforwardedfor header” an attacker essentially could pass off a charter customer’s ip address as their own the plugin as its description explains “inserts a xforwardedfor field into the http request header some servers look at this field to identify the originating ip address”such a trick can be easily automated not unlike a vulnerability that andrew “weev” auernheimer used to glean  ipad users’ email addresses from att’s website in “in theory anyone with minor programming skills could code an automated program that scans every charter ip and returns the customers billing info” taylor explained because isps like charter distribute internet services through blocks of ip addresses an ambitious hacker could have incrementally added the number  to the end of a targeted address and see a different charter customer’s account details each time“personal information leakage as a result of such a vulnerability opens customers up to being attacked on other services such as email providers cellular providers and workrelated functions with many untold consequences” said hector “sabu” monsegur a former black hat hacker and security consultantafter using a subscriber’s ip address to make the simple header modification visiting a generic url on charter’s website to request a forgotten user name exposed a prefilled form containing that user’s last name and home address data from there clicking “next” would expose the account holder’s user nameadvertisementas well visiting a basic url to create a new user name would allow the creation of secondary user accounts and email addresses after a new email address is set up taylor explained the subscriber’s sensitive information could be accessed via api links or viewing part of the site’s source code “for any regular black hat that just wants to wreak havoc on a certain person this exploit will allow them to take full control over charter customer accounts” said the teenage researcherhe also theorized that such access to user information could be a sneaky way for law enforcement to “link customer billing info with nothing more than an ip address and no court order”“having a serial number to customer modems could allow attackers with enough access to monitor traffic at the isp level it could also help rogue law enforcement agents who are looking to circumvent the justice system” monsegur said adding that this type of problem is precisely what us attorneys are pursuing large corporations who fail to protect customer datastewart baker former general counsel at nsa and assistant policy secretary at dhs under president george w bush said he was skeptical that the vulnerability was meant to benefit law enforcement “in fact because it operates automatically and doesn’t require a subpoena most welladvised isps wouldn’t adopt this as a way to give data to law enforcement”baker who hosts a podcast on cyberlaw said the flaw might still have been intentional “for the benefit of customer service reps who can easily do a lookup of a customer complaining about service problems but i confess that i’m guessing”advertisementcharter isn’t the only company that’s left doors open to its subscriber accounts according to taylor he describes the issue as a pattern he’s found with other large isps that identify customers by ip addresses “i first found the same exploit in comcast in ” he said “i would spoof my ip address and go to the ‘forgot username’ page and it would pull up the address on file and then the user names and phone number on the account” taylor said he reported that bug to comcast privatelycyber attacks are on the rise a survey by pricewaterhousecoopers found that last year the number of detected incidents leapt  over  to a total of  million and the number of respondents reporting losses of  million or more almost doubled in a recent report juniper research warned of the rising cost that hacking poses to global industry estimating businesses will see damages of more than  trillion dollars by “keeping our customers and network secure is priority number one at charter”
