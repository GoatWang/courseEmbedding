intended for oral use only use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require dosing via other routes of administration instruct patients and caregivers that the recommended dose should be taken weekly as directed and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity see warnings and precautions  overdosage  it is important that xatmep be measured with an accurate measuring device see warnings and precautions  patient counseling information  a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device a pharmacist can provide an appropriate device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose  acute lymphoblastic leukemia the recommended starting dose of xatmep in multiagent combination chemotherapy maintenance regimens is  mgm given one time weekly after initiating xatmep continuation of appropriate dosing requires periodic monitoring of absolute neutrophil count anc and platelet count to assure sufficient drug exposure that is to maintain anc at a desirable level and to adjust for excessive hematological toxicity  polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis the recommended starting dose of xatmep is  mgm given one time weekly dosages should be tailored to the individual patient and adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response although there is experience with doses up to  mgm week in pediatric patients doses greater than  mgm week may result in a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions especially bone marrow suppression doses between  and  mgm week  to  mgkgweek may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered by an alternative route using another formulation therapeutic response usually begins within  to  weeks and the patient may continue to improve for another  weeks or more certain side effects such as mouth sores may be reduced by folate supplementation with methotrexate in pjia  evaluations prior to starting methotrexate assess hematologic hepatic and renal function before beginning as well as periodically during and before reinstituting therapy with xatmep see warnings and

precautions  bone marrow suppression xatmep suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and lifethreatening pancytopenia anemia leukopenia neutropenia and thrombocytopenia obtain blood counts at baseline and periodically during treatment monitor patients for possible clinical complications of bone marrow suppression provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue xatmep as needed  serious infections patients treated with xatmep are at increased risk for developing lifethreatening or fatal bacterial fungal or viral infections including opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia invasive fungal infections hepatitis b reactivation tuberculosis primary infection or reactivation and disseminated herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus infections monitor patients for the signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with xatmep and treat promptly consider dose modification or discontinuation of xatmep in patients who develop serious infections see warnings and precautions   renal toxicity and increased toxicity with renal impairment xatmep can cause renal damage including acute renal failure monitor renal function to decrease the risk of renal injury and mitigate renal toxicity consider administration of glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations   micromole per liter and delayed clearance due to impaired renal function see glucarpidase prescribing information  gastrointestinal toxicity xatmep can cause diarrhea vomiting stomatitis hemorrhagic enteritis and fatal intestinal perforation patients with peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis are at a greater risk of developing severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions interrupt or discontinue xatmep and institute appropriate supportive care as needed unexpectedly severe and fatal gastrointestinal toxicity can occur with concomitant administration of xatmep primarily at high dosage and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids see drug interactions   hepatic toxicity xatmep can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity including fibrosis cirrhosis and fatal liver failure avoid use of xatmep in patients with chronic liver disease assess liver function prior to initiating xatmep and monitor liver function tests during treatment interrupt or discontinue xatmep as appropriate transient asymptomatic acute liver enzyme elevations are common and are not predictive of subsequent hepatic disease persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis other risk factors for hepatotoxicity include alcoholism obesity diabetes hyperlipidemia previous significant exposure to liver toxins history of liver disease family history of inheritable liver disease persistent abnormal liver chemistry findings duration of therapy and advanced age  pulmonary toxicity methotrexateinduced pulmonary toxicity including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible or fatal cases can occur at all dose levels monitor patients for signs of pulmonary toxicity and interrupt or discontinue xatmep as appropriate  hypersensitivity and dermatologic reactions severe including fatal dermatologic reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis stevensjohnson syndrome exfoliative dermatitis skin necrosis erythema multiforme can occur with methotrexate discontinue xatmep if severe dermatologic reactions occur anaphylaxis can occur with methotrexate if anaphylaxis or any other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs immediately discontinue methotrexate and institute appropriate therapy methotrexate is contraindicated for use in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity radiation dermatitis and sunburn may be “recalled” by the use of methotrexate  secondary malignancies secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels of methotrexate there have been instances of lymphoproliferative disease associated with lowdose oral methotrexate which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate without institution of antineoplastic therapy discontinue xatmep first and institute appropriate treatment if the lymphoma does not regress  embryofetal toxicity based on published reports and methotrexate’s mechanism of action methotrexate can cause embryofetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a

oligospermia and menstrual dysfunction it is not known if the infertility is reversible in affected patients discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients see use in specific populations   increased toxicity due to thirdspace accumulation methotrexate can exit slowly from third‑space accumulations resulting in prolonged terminal plasma halflife and toxicity evacuate significant thirdspace accumulations prior to methotrexate administration see clinical pharmacology   soft tissue and bone toxicity with radiation therapy concomitant radiation therapy increases the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated with methotrexate  laboratory tests closely monitor patients undergoing xatmep therapy so that toxic effects are detected promptly in general monitoring of the following parameters is recommended hematology at least monthly renal function and liver function every  to  months see warnings and precautions    increase monitoring frequency during initial dosing dose changes or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels eg dehydration liver function tests transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy persistent liver function test abnormalities andor depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation see warnings and precautions  pulmonary function tests pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexateinduced lung disease is suspected especially if baseline measurements are available see warnings and precautions   risk of improper dosing both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the recommended dose is taken one time weekly as directed and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity see dosage and administration  overdosage  advise patients

to male and female mice at doses up to  mg per kg per day about  times the maximum recommended daily human dose this dose was  times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice lisinopril was not mutagenic in the ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation it was also negative in a forward mutation assay using chinese hamster lung cells lisinopril did not produce single strand dna breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay in addition lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in chinese

studies  hypertension two doseresponse studies utilizing a oncedaily regimen were conducted in  mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic blood pressure was measured  hours after dosing an antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with  mg of lisinopril in some patients however in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with   or  mg of lisinopril than patients treated with  mg of lisinopril in controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension patients were treated with lisinopril  mg daily hydrochlorothiazide  mg daily or atenolol ‑ mg daily and in other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension patients were treated with lisinopril  mg daily or metoprolol  mg daily lisinopril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was  caucasian lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure lisinopril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older   years patients it was less effective in reducing blood pressure in blacks than in caucasians in hemodynamic studies of lisinopril in patients with essential hypertension blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate in a study in nine hypertensive patients following administration of lisinopril there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function but suggest that changes if any are not large in patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be welltolerated and effective in reducing blood pressure see warnings and precautions  pediatric patients in a clinical study involving  hypertensive pediatric patients  to  years of age patients who weighed   kg received either   or  mg of lisinopril once daily and patients who weighed ≥  kg received either   or  mg of lisinopril once daily at the end of  weeks lisinopril lowered trough blood pressure in a dosedependent manner with antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses   mg  mg per kg this effect was confirmed in a randomized withdrawal phase where the diastolic pressure rose by about  mmhg more in patients randomized to placebo than compared to patients who remained on the middle and high doses of lisinopril the dosedependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups age tanner stage gender and race in this study lisinopril was generally welltolerated in the above pediatric study lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form  heart failure two placebo controlled week clinical studies compared the addition of lisinopril up to  mg daily to digitalis and diuretics alone the combination of lisinopril digitalis and diuretics reduced the following signs and symptoms of heart failure edema rales paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention in one of the studies the combination of lisinopril digitalis and diuretics reduced orthopnea presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as nyha class iii and iv and improved exercise tolerance a large over  patients survival study the atlas trial comparing  and  mg of lisinopril in patients with systolic heart failure showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose during baselinecontrolled clinical trials in patients with systolic heart failure receiving digitalis and diuretics single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate  acute myocardial infarction the gruppo italiano per lo studio della sopravvienza nell’infarto miocardico gissi study was a multicenter controlled randomized unblinded clinical trial conducted in  patients with acute myocardial infarction mi admitted to a coronary care unit it was designed to examine the effects of shortterm  week treatment with lisinopril nitrates their combination or no therapy on shortterm  week mortality and on longterm death and markedly impaired cardiac function hemodynamicallystable patients presenting within  hours of the onset of symptoms were randomized in a  x  factorial design to six weeks of either  lisinopril alone n  nitrates alone n  lisinopril plus nitrates n or  open control n all patients received routine therapies including thrombolytics  aspirin  and a beta blocker  as appropriate normally utilized in acute myocardial infarction mi patients the protocol excluded patients with hypotension systolic blood pressure ≤  mmhg severe heart failure cardiogenic shock and renal dysfunction serum creatinine   mg per dl andor proteinuria   mg per  h patients randomized to lisinopril received  mg within  hours of the onset of symptoms  mg after  hours and then  mg daily thereafter patients with systolic blood pressure less than  mmhg at baseline received  mg of lisinopril if hypotension occurred the lisinopril dose was reduced or if severe hypotension occurred lisinopril was stopped see dosage and administration  the primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at  weeks and a combined end point at  months after the myocardial infarction consisting of the number of patients who died had late day  clinical congestive heart failure or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as ejection fraction ≤  or an akineticdyskinetic ad score ≥  patients receiving lisinopril n alone or with nitrates had an  lower risk of death p   compared to patients who did not receive lisinopril n  vs  respectively at six weeks although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined end point at  months the open nature of the assessment of heart failure substantial loss to followup echocardiography and substantial excess use of lisinopril between  weeks and  months in the group randomized to  weeks of lisinopril preclude any conclusion about this end point patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with lisinopril had a higher  versus  incidence of persistent hypotension systolic blood pressure   mmhg
