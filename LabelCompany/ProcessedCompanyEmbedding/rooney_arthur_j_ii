yearbook  rooneys affiliation with the national football league nfl began in  when he paid a  franchise fee to found a club based in the city of pittsburgh he had named his new team the pirates which was also the name of the citys longestablished major league baseball club of which rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the teams stadium since the leagues inception in  the nfl had wanted a team in pittsburgh due to the citys alreadylong history with football as well as the popularity of the pittsburgh panthers football team an ncaa national championship contender during this period the league was finally able to take advantage of pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to  prohibited sporting events from taking place on sundays when most nfl games take place in  rooney won a parlay at saratoga race course which netted him about  he used the winnings to hire a coach joe bach give contracts to his players and almost win a championship the winnings funded the team until  when he sold the franchise to ny playboy alex thompson thompson wanted to move the franchise to boston so he could be within a fivehour train ride of his club at the same time the philadelphia eagles ran into financial problems rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a  interest in the eagles the other  held by rooney friend and future nfl commissioner bert bell

rooneys are the finest people the people i most respect in american sports ownership ive always felt that way and theres no reason to change they are people of integrity and character the way they put the steelers together to hire a man like chuck noll to emphasize the team concept i have a whole transcendental feeling for the steelers and the rooneys and pittsburgh “ ” — howard cosell october  rooney sent shock waves through the nfl by signing byron whizzer white to a recordbreaking  contract in  this move however did not bring the pirates a winning season and white left the team for the detroit lions the following year the club did not have a season above  until  the year after they were renamed the pittsburgh steelers during world war ii the steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the philadelphia eagles in  and the chicago cardinals in  after the war rooney became team president he longed to bring an nfl title to pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams like the cleveland browns and green bay packers the steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the pirates the team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a thenunknown johnny unitas in training camp unitas would go on to a hall of fame career with the baltimore colts and trading their first round pick in the  draft to the chicago bears who would draft dick butkus with the pick among others nevertheless rooney was popular with owners as a mediator which would carry over to his son dan rooney he was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the new york yanks to dallas texas after the  season due to concerns of racism in the south at the time ultimately the dallas texans failed after one year and the rights were moved to baltimore where the team became the baltimore colts the team now plays in indianapolis in  along with bears owner george

on sunday but in meeting the payroll on monday “ ”  steelers yearbook  rooneys affiliation with the national football league nfl began in  when he paid a  franchise fee to found a club based in the city of pittsburgh he had named his new team the pirates which was also the name of the citys longestablished major league baseball club of which rooney was a fan since a childhood spent in the shadow of the teams stadium since the leagues inception in  the nfl had wanted a team in pittsburgh due to the citys alreadylong history with football as well as the popularity of the pittsburgh panthers football team an ncaa national championship contender during this period the league was finally able to take advantage of pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to  prohibited sporting events from taking place on sundays when most nfl games take place in  rooney won a parlay at saratoga race course which netted him about  he used the winnings to hire a coach joe bach give contracts to his players and almost win a championship the winnings funded the team until  when he sold the franchise to ny playboy alex thompson thompson wanted to move the franchise to boston so he could be within a fivehour train ride of his club at the same time the philadelphia eagles ran into financial problems rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a  interest in the eagles the other  held by rooney friend and future nfl commissioner bert bell bell and rooney agreed to trade places with thompson bell took the role of president of the steelers that he relinquished to rooney in  when bell became commissioner rooney got his good friend and his sisters father in law barney mcginley to buy bells shares barneys son jack arts brother in law retained the mcginley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in  howard cosell on the rooneys the rooneys are the finest people the people i most respect in american sports ownership ive always felt that way and theres no reason to change they are people of integrity and character the way they put the steelers together to hire a man like chuck noll to emphasize the team concept i have a whole transcendental feeling for the steelers and the rooneys and pittsburgh “ ” — howard cosell october  rooney sent shock waves through the nfl by signing byron whizzer white to a recordbreaking  contract in  this move however did not bring the pirates a winning season and white left the team for the detroit lions the following year the club did not have a season above  until  the year after they were renamed the pittsburgh steelers during world war ii the steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the philadelphia eagles in  and the chicago cardinals in  after the war rooney became team president he longed to bring an nfl title to pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams like the cleveland browns and green bay packers the steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the pirates the team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a thenunknown johnny unitas in training camp unitas would go on to a hall of fame career with the baltimore colts and trading their first round pick in the  draft to the chicago bears who would draft dick butkus with the pick among others nevertheless rooney was popular with owners as a mediator which would carry over to his son dan rooney he was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the new york yanks to dallas texas after the  season due to concerns of racism in the south at the time ultimately the dallas texans failed after one year and the rights were moved to baltimore where the team became the baltimore

fans and players the team has occasionally employed this practice after rooneys death however they now focus more on talent than geography throughout the entire draft rooney also supposedly liked

                                    the steelers decades index ed kiely on art rooney the chief index art rooney in  a tribute to dan rooney                 arthur j rooney in  moments after the conclusion of super bowl ix on a chilly january day in new orleans eight years ago captain andy russell held up a football in the pittsburgh steelers locker room at old tulane stadium and handed it to an old man this ones for the chief russell said its been a long time coming  the chief art rooney pulled out the old national football league ledger books he keeps carefully wrapped in a cellophane bag in the desk drawer of his offices at three rivers stadium the books are  years old now but theyre still in remarkedly good condition they tell the story in rooneys own neat handwriting of the birth of a franchise the humble origins of a team celebrating its golden anniversary season in  the yearold rooney opens the pages of the first ledger it suggests footballs equivalent of john hancocks pulling the declaration of independence out of his desk drawer to show where he signed it i found these when we moved here i dont think anybody around here is interested in them rooney says almost apologetically but they bring back a lot of memories for me he remembers byron whizzer white johnny blood mcnally and bill dudley as vividly as terry bradshaw franco harris and lynn swann he remembers the bad old days as well as the good old days he remembers he founded the team the year fdr became president and didnt get his first championship trophy until gerald ford held the office he enjoyed all the years even the frustrating ones when i had to walk in the alleys instead of on the main drag but the most satisfying ones were when we finally won he says the ledger books show it all started on september    the wednesday the steelers played their first game at forbes field against the new york giants there were  fans who paid a total of  the steelers lost  but rooney noted crowd was very enthusiastic that was the modest beginning a whole generation of fans has grown up thinking the steelers always were the modern successful organisation that rooneys two eldest sons dan and art jr and coach chuck noll built when they became the team of the seventies but the games pioneers never dreamed of instant relays and super sundays back in the days when they ran their franchises with a handshake rooney still remembers the time in the s when george halas of chicago offered to give him  more than the guarantee for shifting a game date the guarantee was  percent of the gate or a minimum of  when it came time to divide the money rooney s  percent amounted to  after rooney reminded halas about the extra  halas argued he already was getting  more than the  guarantee the two men argued their points back and forth until halas got up from behind his desk and said ill fight you for it  rooney laughed and said he didnt want to fight but finally he won his argument and walked off with a check for   as rooney got to the door he turned to halas and said george you know if wed had that fight you were no sure thing  it was just a hop skip i and a jump from semipro ball in those days maybe just a hop rooney says between chomps on his familiar cigar the biggest thrill wasnt in winning on sunday but in meeting the payroll on monday an athlete a promoter and a noted horse player rooney had been operating a semipro team for years he was able to bring that team into the national football league after paying a  nfl franchise fee in  simply because the pennsylvania blue laws banning sunday play were repealed that year one of the most enduring legends is that he founded the team after scoring heavily at the racetrack he did make a memorable twoday killing at old empire city and saratoga but that came in  after the franchise had been founded the early days of the steelers are rich in legend and lore rooneys ledger entry after a  game  pittsburgh looked bad crowd hostile  could have summed up a lot of games over the years with a twinkle in his irish eyes rooney who seems to have stepped out of the pages of the last hurrah tells stories about those days i was at the track most of the time and unfortunately some of my coaches were with me he says rooneys quick wit and easy going manner have given him the image of being a loveable loser he pleads innocent of the charge i take it terribly he says nobody feels any worse than i do about losing the steelers didnt always lose at times they played better than legend now has it three different times  in   and   the steelers needed to win their last game to clinch the division title on all three of those occasions they were playing a team they had beaten during the regular season all three times they lost that was the story of the franchise rooney often was operating on a shoestring budget because forbes field was a small stadium and he was a good natured guy who never liked to make the tough decisions that go with a winning football team my father was a little bit of a rogue and he had some flaws but they were great flaws his son art jr says he carried loyalty and friendship to the extreme on top of everything else the steelers always seemed to be unlucky there were no immaculate receptions in those days instead there were plays such as frank giffords diving onehanded catch that helped the new york giants beat the steelers  in the  finale for the division title the steelers coach in that game buddy parker once groaned when this team gets lucky itll be lucky for ten years he didnt know he was looking ahead to the s when franco harris made the immaculate reception and the steelers won coin flips for the rights to draft terry bradshaw and lynn swann the team got new uniforms in  and changed its name from pirates to steelers when art rooney stopped at his teams hershey pennsylvania training camp to watch practice a newsman asked what he thought of the team they look like the same old steelers rooney cracked the name stuck for years and years when anything went wrong the fans derided them as the same old steelers rooneys main project until the end of world war ii simply was keeping the team alive the steelers had only one winning season in their first  years even signing whizzer white in  for the then incredible sum of  didnt help the team went  with the future us supreme court justice in the backfield in  rooney even sold the team to alexis thompson and bought half of the philadelphia franchise owned by his friend bert bell he quickly had second thoughts and convinced thompson to swap teams so rooney and bell shared the pittsburgh franchise during world war ii bell retained his interest until  when he became commissioner and sold his share to rooney and barney mcginley whose son jack still owns  percent of the team after world war ii pro football took its first step towards bigtime status rooney figured it was the beginning of a new era when he signed dr jock sutherland who had won national collegiate championships at the university of pittsburgh in the s as coach in  a tough disciplinarian sutherland had the steelers in a playoff for the division title with philadelphia in  the steelers lost  but sutherland seemed to be building a winner the franchise then was hit by tragedy sutherland died of a brain tumor in the spring of  the team floundered coaches john michelosen joe bach and walt kiesling who spent  years with the team and was called in to coach three different times bach who had coached the club in  before leaving for various assistant and head coaching jobs at the collegiate level modernised the team in  when the steelers became the last pro club to abandon the single wing but bach had to resign in  because of illness it was an era noted for per sonnel mistakes the steelers cut johnny unitas a ninth round draft pick in  they made obscure defensive back gary click the number one pick in the  draft in  they passed up jim brown for len dawson the steelers had a sprinkling of good players including elbie nickel ernie stautner jim finks lynn chandnois jack butler fran rogel and pat brady  but they really were the same old steelers the only time art rooney ever interfered with a coach in his half century with the club came during the kiesling regime a conservative coach keisling sent rogel up the middle on the first play of every game the fans even chanted hididdlediddle rogel up the middle  so rooney finally ordered kiesling to call a pass play on the first play of a game in  it was such a surprise that jack scarhath threw an yard touchdown pass to jack goose mcclairen but the play was called back because of an offside penalty and on the next play first and  rogel went up the middle years later kiesling confessed to having told a player to intentionally beat the snap buddy parkers arrival in  signaled the start an upswing in steeler fortunes the new coach brought in veterans such as bobby layne his old detroit quarterback john henry johnson and eugene big daddy lipscomb and made the team a contender but parker was noted for his rash moves and impulsive trades  most notably the  trade of wide receiver buddy dial to dallas for the rights to defensive tackle scott appleton of texas whom the steelers couldnt sign it became known as the buddy dial fornothing trade another chapter of the same old steelers after the dial trade there was a changing of the guard art rooney told buddy parker to get approval for future trades from his eldest son dan born the year the team was founded dan was  and taking administrative control of the team rooneys second son art jr two years younger than dan was moving into the scouting department a younger generation of rooneys was coming of age art jr known as artie says a friend of mine told me it wasnt for us it was more like a quest in the days of the knights king arthur and all that stuff it was exciting to work in that
