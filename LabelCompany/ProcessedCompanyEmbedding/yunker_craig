farms cy farms the third in our series on genesee county farms and farmers the house was ramshackle there were broken doors and windows that wouldnt close but the land was good carl yunker knew it was soil he could grow something in i was after the dirt carl said i said if i got the dirt ill get the rest this is good land he couldnt buy the acre farm and its  cows but he could lease it he moved his family from sheldon to a house without plumbing in elba it was  the house was more than  years old the yunkers married in  and with two young children would put down roots near the intersection of transit and north byron bernice went from cooking with gas to a wood stove in kitchen with warped floorboards that first thanksgiving she was expecting  people for supper the night before a cat crept in through the broken door from the cellar into the kitchen and feasted on turkey breast the day after thanksgiving carl built a new cellar door in the kitchen paint was peeling from one wall bernice drove into batavia and bought the largest rand mcnally map of the united states she could find she bought a series of smaller state maps she decorated the wall with the maps she said so visitors would discuss the state of the union rather than the state of the house i said if she lives with me for a year she will stay with me for good carl said craig yunker craig yunker the yunkers second of five children was born in  in sheldon he was raised in the house on transit road today the house that was falling apart  years ago is now the home of craig and kimberly yunker  its fully restored of course inside the walls are white and the floor polished hardwood left exposed are structural beams that were hand hewn in the 0s by strong men with axes and chisels carl who turns  next month lives with bernice in a farmhouse built in 0 when the yunkers first moved to elba the merrimans who farmed the land before the yunkers lived in the newer house while the yunkers lived in the older house after carl and bernice moved in bernice wanted a little storage room at the back of the house fixed up to use as an artist studio  carl expanded the room and added a second level giving bernice all the space she needed to paint and draw and display her work when carl and bernice met she was a preachers kid in sheldon they saw each other for the first time in the foyer of a church when i saw him he was sort of looking me up and down one sunday when i went into church and i thought you young snip you  bernice said i thought he was  years old and he was  bernice yunker bernice knew nothing about farming when she met carl but shes proud to call herself a farmers wife thats the name of her studio  farmers wife studio  where she paints and teaches art classes bernice has been a member of the genesee county art society for more than  years  her favorite subject is trees she paints and draws a lot of trees well she paints and draws a lot carl said shes a workaholic when it comes to art when she has five minutes he said shes in the studio working on something bernice has completed thousands of pieces of art earlier this year she threw out about  of her paintings living on a farm bernice said her children learned the value of work the boys started working in the barns when they were  getting paid for their work by the time they were  they were buying their own clothes i dont see how the city people to it bernice said these boys were never under my feet because they were working after all that farm work craig wasnt sure he wanted to be a farmer his mother dropped him off at cornell university for his freshman year and thats when he told her he wasnt sure he wanted to farm he read jack kerouac as dean moriarty took to the road so did craig yunker after the first semester of his second year at cornell craig  left on a sixmonth ramble across america he drove a  chevy he packed  a mamiyasekor  dlt camera in las vegas his car was done and he was out of money he managed to make it to california and spent some time at a commune before returning to new york he came home and went back to cornell craig has a degree in agricultural economics and a masters in resource economics carl had gone from tenant farmer to farm owner in  when craig came home father and son became partners all of craigs siblings found pursuits other than farming gail the oldest lives on a boat north of seattle chris three years younger than craig is a military man and lives in virginia joy lives in troy and heidi lives in medina cy farms is owned today by carl craig craigs son christian and pj riner who is now retired but for years handled the daytoday operations of the farm while craig managed the business and cys growth what started as a acre tenant dairy farm is now  acres of turf corn wheat soybeans alfalfa onions and green peas how cy transformed from a small dairy farm to one of the largest crop farms in wny is as much a story of persistence and hard work as good fortune craig said id like to be able to tell you that i had everything planned out but some things just happen craig said our success is sort of a hybrid of luck and timing with some hard work thrown in but a lot of it is just luck the big turning point came in  when cy farms was a acre operation with 0 cows the federal government decided the country was awash in dairy products the usda wanted fewer cows and fewer dairy farms the government set up a reverse auction  farmers would set a price for their herd and the government would start with the lowest bid and buy up more and more herds at higher and higher prices until the target number of cows were purchased if farmers put in a bid they obligated themselves to destroying their cows or exporting them to a foreign country we submitted a fairly high bid and i was fairly confident that we wouldnt get taken craig said we only bid it because its just one of those things where everything has its price so we said lets put in a number high enough that if we get taken well be happy we didnt expect to get taken and we did we were surprised that our bid got accepted but we had already signed it so we had no choice at that point the yunkers had a year to dispose of their herd by contract they couldnt produce milk for five years the story continues after the jump click on the headline to read more they were left with  acres of land as carl said good land good soil you can grow things in good soil things like corn and peas and cabbage i thought at that time maybe well get back in the dairy business but we never went back to milking cows craig said carl yunker made the right decision in  he came to genesee county because he thought the good flat farm fields of elba would give him more flexibilty as a farmer than the hill country around sheldon without cows cy farms became a crop farm and began to grow carl was also working on his own plan by age  he wanted to start backing out of the business and handing over more control to craig too many farmers according to carl said dont have a plan for handing their farms off to their children thats one of my big criticism of family farms where dad hangs on so long and doesnt give the younger generation the opportunity to develop themslves and move on carl said family farms that cease being family farms have meant opportunity for the yunkers there was for example a 0acre farm  including muckland  that fell into the hands of four brothers four feuding brothers the brothers sold off their farm equipment and leased the land to cy farms craig knew better than to sit all four brothers in a room and try to buy their land if one guy liked this deal the other guy wouldnt like the deal because the other brother liked the deal craig said he was patient he stayed friendly with each brother it took i think two years but i got that deal craig said mucklands it was a big deal too big for cy to handle on its own to help finance the purchase craig sold off some of the land to a neighboring farmer the purchase included muck good oniongrowing muck cy farms added onions to their product line next they added grass perhaps the biggest deal for the yunkers was the purchase of batavia turf initially craig was just interested in acquiring more crop land tony peca owned  acres of farmland craig was thinking about the land not the business peca started batavia turf in  and it was the original turf farm in new york when the thruway was constructed through genesee county part of the deal was peca could keep his billboard next to the i batavia turf has the only billboard in new york on thruway authority property the business was very well known craig said and as he dug into the particulars of the deal he realized it would be a good thing to buy not just the land but the business we looked at it as an opportunity to expand craig said pecas two sons signed on as yunker employees to oversee turf production and manage the marketing for two years they were paid aboveaverage salaries craig said to help the yunkers break into the business we didnt know anything about growing turf and we didnt know anything about marketing turf craig said calves at cy heifer farm the yunkers of course as former dairy farmers do know cows and in a different way the next cy farms expansion got the family back into the dairy business rather than milk cows they raise them for area dairy farmers the opportunity came to the yunkers when agway let one of its business units fall into bankruptcy a few years before agway managers decided one of the secrets of success for dairy farmers in california was the replacement heifer business rather than dairy farmers raising their own calves there are whole farms that do nothing but raise calves for other farmers agway thought that might be a good business line in wny the company picked land owned by cy properities for the operation raising calves means manure manure means noxious odors cow odors can cause complaints from nearby residents the yunkers owned a plot of land just southwest of the mucklands up on a ridge overlooking the onion fields a bit isolated from residential neighborhoods the wind carries odors away from any homes in the area and out over the farmfields it seemed like a smart spot to raise calves and convert manure into plant food cy heifers takes in calves from about 0 dairy farmers in the area as they grow they move through a series of barns according to size and age until theyre old enough to be moved back into the farmers production herd the dairy farms can concentrate on milk production rather than raising their own calves the  acres of cy farms is divided among 0 or so parcels in elba byron batavia and stafford all of the land is owned by cy properties which leases land to cy farms batavia turf and cy heifers each business unit operates on its own pl profit and loss statement but farm equipment and employees are shared among the operations the morning managers meeting it takes a lot of coordination to manage the crops the land the equipment and the people just under  employees total each morning at  craig yunker and the farms five managers meet in a midcentury ranch home that has been converted to office space on the southeast corner of transit and north byron  meeting with craig every day are christian yunker charles augello chuck barie mac ewell and mike riner first topic each morning the weather cold rain wind and sun  whatever the elements  will determine much of the work schedule for the day  its hard to plow a field when its muddy and darn near useless to spray pea plants in the wind everything starts with weather and then you plan your day craig said the morning meeting is a time to balance priorities against available resources theres usually more work than hours in the day or feet on the ground there are five us every morning judging who needs what tractor who needs what truck who needs what personnel or this or that and sometimes you know something has to wait craig said one man is going to be frustrated because hes got his plan but there arent enough tractors trucks and people to do everything what crops are grown each season is planned out up to a year in advance craig and his team make a pl for every crop they grow each crop is analyzed on its own for its own profitability craig said if crops are not profitable in one year thats normal but if its a trend and they stop making us money then we stop growing them we did that with tomatoes this year you wont find any cabbage growing on cy property  when the management team analyzed the potential for cabbage two problems loomed large the affordable health care act and the difficulty in hiring migrant labor cabbage may grow again on cy farms but first craig said he needs to be assured that employing more than  people wont drive up the cost of health insurance and he needs to know he can hire legal workers that wont get swept away in immigration raids solutions to those problems if there are any will only come out of washington then theres the price of corn last year and this corn prices have hit historically high levels craigs office is dominated by a large wooden desk he has a bookshelf and filing cabinet on one wall are original color penandink drawings by don carmicheal of the old courthouse and county building  momentos of craigs tenure as chairman of the genesee county legislature in the s corn on the back of door craig keeps a poster of corn prices for more than  years it shows corn prices fluctuating in a fairly nominal pattern then theres a big spike  prices climbed above  a few years back  then prices returned to a fairly normal level craig points to a spot off the chart and says now prices are here that would be somewhere over the  mark sixdollar corn is another reason not to grow cabbage last years drought in the midwest and this years flooding in the eastern corn belt have been good things for wny corn growers last year we got prices higher than we ever expected and we had a very good year because of that craig said we forwardcontracted our corn and sold a good portion of the next years crop near the corner of route  and ivison road are a half dozen storage bins that glisten in the sun theyre made to store feed corn cabbage is a perishable crop and must be sold close to harvest corn can be stored much longer the idea is to sell it when its profitable and not when you have to sell it craig said onions are a crop that must be sold at harvest too its one of the most challenging crops cy farms grows out on the muck farmers battle wind rain and weeds its no different for the small muck farmer or the big muck farmer  the demand for onions doesnt change much year to year as craig put it a restaurant isnt going to buy more onions just because the price drops if the price is high it doesnt suppress demand that can make growing onions at a profit a challenge which is why craig thinks cy farms has an advantage with its  acres and more than half a dozen crops it grows farm managers can rotate crops react to changes in the market and the weather and absorb in most years unexpected price fluctuations one of the advantages we have over somebody that just grows onions is that diversity and that stabilizing effect craig said the production numbers for cy farms in a typical year are impressive corn   acres at  bushels per acre wheat   acres at  bushels per acre onions   acres at  lbs bags soybeans   acres at  bushels per acre alfalfa   acres at  to  tons per acre barley  0 acres at 0 to 0 bushels per acre  acres of turf harvested per year batavia turf grows more than  acres of grass per year but it takes  to  months to bring grass from seed to sod sliced and rolled onto pallets ready for delivery to customers from pittsburgh to watertown jose castanada and katie houseknect with  acres available for crop rotation the grassgrowing business has benefited from being absorbed into cy farms one problem smaller turf operations run into is that with only a few hundred acres available used year after year for the same crop the sod is more susceptible to weeds and disease  jose castaneda manages the turf operation and katie houseknect and chuck hoover sell the grass jose makes it easy to sell a quality product houseknect said we do have the finest quality sod in wny because of our quality soil the emerald green color the guarantee of quality the fact that we can rotate our crop and keep the sod clean of any type of infestations makes it easy to sell the grass is 0 percent kentucky bluegrass and varieties of fescue the fescue is more drought and disease tolorant than bluegrass and helps batavia turfs sod keep its emerald green color even in dry summers every day except rain days during the spring and summer crews use a precision computercontrolled grass harvester to cut and roll the turf grass is delivered to clients the same day or the day before its scheduled for planting  customers include homeowners schools landscapers contractors and sports field owners yunker is clearly proud of the role batavia turf has played in helping diversify the family business and add to its overall growth running a big farm keeps craig busy but he still has time for himself hes never lost his love of adventure in his office behind his desk is a large photo of a sailboat charging through the waters of lake ontario craig yunker with his hemingway collection craig loves sailing the man who once drove a  chevy across america still loves to travel and he loves ernest hemingway when craig travels he prefers to stay where hemingway stayed hemingway lived in havana for a time so craig has been to cuba when visitors enter the home of craig and kimberly yunker they find themselves first in a room with few pieces of furniture there are a couple of paintings on the walls to the back of the room is a floortoceiling window that frames a green back yard yellow roses grow by the patio on the south wall of the room at the center of the house there is also a cabinet filled books by hemingway and about hemingway craig and kimberly have three children christian  cyrus  and katherine  theres a picture of their children with the hemingway books upstairs in the old farmhouse craig pointed to a wineskin hanging from a single nail pounded into one of the exposed handhewn beams of a guest room the wineskin is autographed  the skin is from pamplona spain hemingway made many trips in his time to pamplona he wrote about the bullfights there in the sun also rises men drink wine from bota bags in pamplona when craig sojourned in pamplona he stopped in a shop to buy a wineskin craig spoke to his travel companion he mentioned hemingway the shop owner exlaimed oh ernesto the little man scurried to the back of the store and retrieved a photo it was a framed print of the shop owner with hemingway standing behind him while the shop owner signed a wineskin next to the wineskin hanging from that wooded beam is a photo of craig yunker standing where ernesto once stood while the shop owner signed his wineskin what do you like about hemingway christian yunker his sense of adventure he was his own person he lived his own life i like his style of writing its straightforward cy farms is a big operation now and christian yunker is next in line to run it like father like son craig is giving christian increasing responsibility for the farm over the years just as his father did with him christian is also a graduate of cornell after college he worked in new jersey for six years handling farm loans for farm credit east it was good experience it gave him a broader knowledge of what it takes to run a modern farm like a lot of sons christian admires his father and thinks craig has a real talent for the business he has the ability to deal with people and negotiate deals christian said hes much more of a bigpicture thinker most of his decisionmaking is about five 0 years down the road which for some people doesnt come as naturally as it does for him christian has two young daughters  much too young to know if theyll take to farming i want them to be successful in life so im not going to presume anything christian said looking down the road christian said perhaps they wont run the farm perhaps it will become an employeerun operation its too soon to say so these days while little girls play and farmworkers work one of the favorite pastimes of carl yunker is sitting on his porch reading novels and watching the traffic pass on transit road carl figures half the traffic is trucks and tractors owned by cy farms he said hes proud of what the little farm in elba has become he thinks it will be around for a good long while now i hope it keeps going successfully and im sure it will carl said weve got a great team of people put together people are the heart of an operation youve gotta have good people or you dont

examine the influence of various intensity levels of athletic participation on academic and leadership performance in a selective institution for the purpose of this study a retrospective analysis of existing admissions and student performance data was conducted the continuous dependent variables were academic and leadership performance scores the categorical independent variables were the three intensity levels of athletic participation high commitment athletes moderate commitment athletes general population students gender and race the subjects for this study included  of the  students that graduated from a selective institution from  through  results of this study provide evidence that participation in college athletics did not hinder student academic performance in a selective institution even athletes that participated in high commitment athletics were found to reach their academic potential in this setting these findings are attributed to the institutional policies that allowed athletes to remain integrated within the student body as a whole it remains unclear however which policies had the greatest impact on the academic success of athletes in this investigation in a separate analysis athletic participation was found to negatively influence high commitment athletes leadership performance scores in a selective institution given the scarcity of published research examining the influence of athletic participation on leadership development the findings of this investigation may form the foundation upon which future studies will build upon the implications for
