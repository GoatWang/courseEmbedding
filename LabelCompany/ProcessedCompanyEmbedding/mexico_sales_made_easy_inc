don’t worry see it again and learn how to get  in free advertising from the us government read more why franchising is going global posted by sandro on  pm in news  comments off on why franchising is going global why franchising is going global taking a franchise brand international is in a sense the final frontier for growth it’s where many franchise brands that have begun – and been successful – in the us turn when they seek expansion it’s a strategy that often occurs in part because of growth that has saturated domestic markets and territories typically larger more established franchise brands begin looking across borders for untapped markets and potential growth it’s an expansion strategy that’s not new but during the past couple of decades as franchising has continued to grow as a popular business model the international growth strategy has been on the rise international franchising can also provide opportunities for new and existing franchisees looking for expansion options there are opportunities as near as mexico and canada and as far as the middle east in one sense international franchising can be a relatively smooth and easy process after all the franchise concept is built around infrastructure simplicity replication and streamlined operations what works in one place generally works in another and many international markets are wide open and untapped and offer enormous potential for franchisors – with the right products services and business culture consider this eighty percent of the world’s population lives in areas that are considered emerging markets the us department of commerce estimates that over  percent of the expected growth in the world’s trade over the next two decades will come from developing countries particularly big emerging markets which account for over half the world’s population but only  percent of its gross domestic product nevertheless there are challenges for franchisors that seek expanding kingdoms in other lands – and often for the franchisees who operate the units franchisors look at key markers such as what kind of demand exists for their products and services in the new international markets the initial cost of entry sourcing supplies and related vendor issues and whether or not it makes sense to open company and franchise units in these new territories franchisors are going to evaluate a country’s gdp per capita general population statistics and the overall health of the country’s economy another significant factor affecting international expansion laws often vary from country to country on small business operations and franchise licensing it can be complicated and requires research franchise representatives need to visit the countries they are considering moving into and devote time and resources to studying these cultures very carefully one of the first questions to consider is time of entry one school of thought says not to be the first to the market but a close second this way another franchisor essentially invests in the market research for all competitors if the product or service flies and the market is proved to be viable and economically attractive then other brands and concepts can begin to move in one of the most critical components of successful international franchise expansion is finding the right partners this is a key ingredient to longterm success and profitability for the franchise brand there’s likely to be cultural barriers political barriers legal barriers language barriers and a hodge podge of other factors that differ from standard us operations that’s why it’s important to identify key people on the ground who know and understand all of these read more expanding vidbox in mexico posted by sandro on  am in news  comments off on

with a touch of wanderlust are looking to mexico as a viable business location and for smart reasons elizabeth helsley fell in love with mexico while on a yearlong college study abroad trip to mexico city after graduating in  she went back home and worked in san diego until a usbased company relocated her back to mexico city she was thrilled with the opportunity so much so that in  she left the company and started her international consulting business global luxe in guadalajara “i get up and am excited to go to work every day” she beams entrepreneurs like helsley with a touch of wanderlust are looking to mexico as a viable business location and for smart reasons first while the rest of the world reels from financial meltdown mexico’s economy is going strong “after the crisis of  mexico proved to be very stable” says mauricio monroy president of the usmexico chamber of commerce california regional chapter “we had a similar situation in the late ’s and since then our banks have gotten healthy and diversified so we are nicely insulated from what the rest of the world is going through” second the exchange rate at press time  usd was equivalent to around  mexican pesos this is good for mexico as the peso has historically been worth much less the result “it is cheaper for mexicans to buy us products and services” he says third the lack of culture shock on the part of mexican consumers american products advertising and services are commonplace in mexico making it that much easier for usborn entrepreneurs to launch a business inside the country fourth us companies can establish a presence in mexico and stay owned and managed by us nationals “in many other countries you have to hire a local employee” monroy says “here it’s not hard to start a business—you need  pesos for an llc and  pesos to form a corporation” but before you book a flight heading south it’s also important to consider some of the differences that might accompany setting up your business in mexico what you need to start a business in mexico monroy suggests doing a few things before making the move including a marketing survey “you need to make sure your product or service will be well received in mexico” he says “i recommend talking to chamber of commerces business organizations and economic development organizations you can pay them to conduct surveys for you” then it is off to do the paperwork of setting up a business mexico has a variety of business launch requirements—from licensing to permitting fees—and it’s important to make sure you have everything covered not sure where to look try the local economic development corporation or hire a notario publico helsley chose to do the latter “a notary in mexico is not the same as a notary in the us” she says “here it is a highlevel special position every read more i want to do business in mexico posted by ryan on  am in blog  comments off on i want to do business in mexico read more top  reasons your product will get stuck at the mexico border posted by ryan on  am in news  comments off on top  reasons your product will get stuck at the mexico border anyone who has had to deal with mexican authorities either on a personal or business basis will have had experience of how concerned they are with having paperwork in order hispanic countries seem to take documentation to whole new level and mexico is no different each i must be dotted and each t crossed when you are about to export goods to mexico you should prepare for an administrative and logistics minefield you will need to present comprehensive documentation to support the import of your goods and the distribution within mexico’s borders any discrepancies or deficiencies in the paperwork and your goods will be seized and held until the problem areas are resolved to the satisfaction of the mexican importation laws which are administered by the general customs administration before your product crosses into mexico imported goods need to stop and be unloaded at a receiving warehouse on the us side what i mean is that your truck can not drive right across the border deliver the product and drive back over the border but it’s before even loading your goods onto the truck or into the hold of a ship or plane that the problems with importation could begin the top five reasons your goods might get stuck at the mexican border range from the temporary to the almost indefinite  your goods are missclassified all of your goods will need to be classified for import duty payments the documentation must conform to the harmonized tariff schedule hts and this includes identifying them as nafta or non nafta imports underneath this classification comes a subclassification by industry the goods to be imported must be annotated as to the industry for which they are being imported as this too will have an impact on duties payable once at customs for clearing the professional customs expert cannot change the classification details it is up to the exporter importer to ensure the classification paperwork is in order and though this can often be done online it is a lengthy process you will need to provide proof of the payment of any import duties and taxes payable these might include iva vat customs processing fees warehouse fees and special taxes on production and services all goods must be marked with country of origin stamps or stickers and be imported with a certificate or origin imports from nafta countries may be free from importation taxes  your goods are misvalued the valuation you place upon your goods on the importation documentation will determine the duties to be paid if any of course the country of origin will also impact these duties payable if upon inspection of the paperwork or the goods themselves the customs officer believes that the goods have been undervalued whether deliberately or mistakenly then the goods will be held whilst checks are made these checks may include internet searches for similar goods and phoning the supplier to ensure price charged is the correct valuation this is not only on the exporter end it is also a problem found with importers where the importer needs to attach valuation paperwork and undervalues for avoidance of tax and duties mexican and american authorities work closely together to ensure that there is a good knowledge of the origin of goods and valuation of goods read more  things you absolutely need to do before start selling in mexico posted by ryan on  am in news  comments off on  things you absolutely need to do before start selling in

avoid costly delays by having correct labels prepared for all the products you’re exporting be aware that there are labeling requirements for your shipping boxes and containers as well and compliance will make it easy to move your goods smoothly across the border  you need to have the correct hs classification numbers for your products hs stands for harmonized system and is an internationally recognized system used to classify products so they can be easily identified by any country export codes are six digits and categories of products are then subcategorized with an additional four numbers creating a ten number hs classification for example the category of computers might have a six digit code  and a laptop a subcategory might have an additional  number code  therefore the number  is the hs code that allows anyone in any country to understand that you’re exporting a laptop computer simple and easy to understand in any language – hence the harmony you’ll also encounter the term schedule b – a schedule of classification used internationally and here in the us administered by the us census bureau by international agreement most countries recognize the same first  “harmonized” digits these are the first  numbers schedule b and are usually adequate for export purposes are you wondering adequate for what good question you’ll need to know if there are any tariffs that will need to be paid or whether a product qualifies for a preferential tariff under the free trade agreement the class of goods determines appropriate tariffs and your schedule b number is needed to fill out several required documents including the shipper’s export declaration certificates of origin as well as other necessary shipping documents finally realize that while at first glance it may seem like there’s a lot to know perhaps a new set of rules that feels like ‘one more thing to do’ – they’re really quite simple and the mexican market represents so much potential that learning the

how to know which flagwaving products are true red white and blue consumer reports magazine february  puzzling labels laws allow for patriotic symbols as long as makers identify where a product was made given a choice between a product made in the us and an identical one made abroad  percent of americans would rather buy the american product according to a new nationally representative survey by the consumer reports national research center more than  percent of those people cited retaining manufacturing jobs and keeping american manufacturing strong in the global economy as very important reasons for buying american about  percent cited concern about the use of child workers or other cheap labor overseas or stated that americanmade goods were of higher quality and people would pay extra to buy american more than  percent of all respondents indicated they’d buy americanmade clothes and appliances even if those cost  percent more than imported versions more than  percent said they’d pay at least an extra  percent perhaps more surprising according to a new survey of consumers in the us and abroad by the boston consulting group more than  percent of chinese respondents said they’d buy the americanmade version over the chinese even if it were to cost more clearly most americans want to know where products are made and want to buy those that will help create or keep jobs in the us—an attempt applauded by economists like jeff faux a distinguished fellow of the nonprofit nonpartisan economic policy institute in washington dc “consumers need to understand that all jobs and wages are interconnected” faux told us “when you buy foreign goods—and sometimes there’s no choice—it means that fewer us workers will have the money to buy the goods and services you sell” but what does “made in the usa” even mean and how can you identify what’s made where in this special report we’ll decipher labeling laws and explain why a product that pictures an american flag might be made abroad identify companies that still make products in the us hear from economists about manufacturing trends and provide our experts’ assessment of the quality of some americanmade apparel a guessing game photo tooga few products except cars textiles furs and woolens are required by law to reveal their american heritage but when any manufacturer chooses to boast of an american connection it must comply with federal rules designed to keep consumers from being misled our evidence shows that if not misled consumers are at least confused readers flood consumer reports with letters and email seeking explanations as to why for example frozen blueberries from oregon are identified as a product of chile why a company named florida’s natural sells apple juice with concentrate from brazil why pants made in vietnam are labeled “authentic active outdoor american” or why a tshirt with the words “made in the” above the us flag comes from mexico though perplexing such words and pictures don’t usually violate regulations that are issued by the federal trade commission the agency responsible for protecting consumers from false or deceptive product claims the key factors in determining whether a “made in the usa” claim is deceptive says ftc senior attorney laura koss are the claim’s context and whether it’s likely to mislead a reasonable consumer ultimately the line between legal and illegal is determined by the overall impression planted in consumers’ minds but the line is blurry every case is different and subject to interpretation koss says most of the complaints the ftc receives are initiated by companies that are pointing a finger at competitors they claim are seeking an unfair advantage when a company definitely crosses the line the ftc’s priority is stopping the behavior not punishment if a company refuses it faces civil penalties—in theory in practice the ftc has brought only one civil penalty case since the late s slapping toolmaker stanley with a  fine in  to settle charges involving the pedigree of its zero degree ratchets stanley claimed that the ratchets were made in america but the ftc noted that much of their content was foreign the types of claims “made in the usa” claims can be “unqualified” or “qualified” unqualified means that “all or virtually all” significant parts and processing are of us origin the product may contain a small amount of foreign ingredients if they’re not significant—the knobs of a barbecue grill for instance companies must be able to document any claim qualified claims the main cause of confusion come in many forms but each must tell the whole story take the new ipad mini the packaging says “designed by apple in california assembled in china” that’s an acceptable claim by contrast a company could land in trouble if it said “created in the us” without specifying the country of manufacture since consumers are likely to interpret a vague standalone term like “created” as allinclusive the ftc requires companies to post prominent unambiguous statements such as the actual country of origin to leave an accurate impression readers who have sent us complaints seem most irritated by foreignmade products whose makers have patriotic names american mills americana olives great american seafood united states sweaters the us lock company or whose packages have flagwaving slogans “true american quality” or symbols pictures of the flag eagle statue of liberty but all of those products are likely to be legal as long as they leave a clear impression about where they’re made another type of labeling law enforced by us customs and border protection with an assist from the department of agriculture requires imported goods to bear a countryoforigin label when they enter the us if an import combines materials or processing from more than one country the agency considers the country of origin to be the last country in which a “substantial transformation” occurred—for example the place where a computer was fabricated not the country that supplied most parts the usda’s agricultural marketing service is responsible for administering and enforcing countryoforigin labeling of certain foods large retailers must use signs labels or stickers to identify the birthplace of covered commodities most meat fish fresh or frozen fruits vegetables and some nuts that’s why some brands of salmon are labeled both “wildcaught alaskan” and “product of thailand” the fish was caught in us waters but took a detour to asia to be skinned and boned to take advantage of cheaper labor before making its return voyage under the law that side trip must be noted bottom line if you want to buy american products these tips should help read labels carefully using the info above consult websites that name companies making products in the us americansworkingcom madeinamericaforevercom and madeinusaorg contact a manufacturer directly check our listing of some of the companies still manufacturing in america still made in the usa crayola crayons photo manufacturer according to the bureau of labor statistics american manufacturing lost almost  million jobs between  and  “offshoring” became a buzzword with the implementation of the north american free trade agreement in  but the more recent hemorrhaging of jobs was due in large part to china’s entry into the world trade organization in  notes ron hira associate professor of public policy at the rochester institute of technology a decade of bls data reveals heavy job losses across more than a dozen manufacturing sectors including apparel and textiles electrical equipment iron and steel production computers glass and leather tanning and finishing why are foreign nations so appealing to manufacturers simple economics for starters in  compensation costs wages and benefits for manufacturing jobs in the us were  per hour on average according to the bls that’s lower than in  northern and western european countries but far higher than costs in china  per hour in  based on bls estimates another manufacturing powerhouse india has even lower hourly compensation costs than china but depending on the manufacturing sector labor may account for only a small fraction of operating costs so china may offer manufacturers “goodie packages” to relocate including tax breaks lowcost land rental and reduced utility costs according to hal sirkin a senior partner with globalmanagement consultants boston consulting group in exchange us companies might be required to take on local companies as business partners or cut other deals with area businesses or municipalities stihl chain saw photo stihl the appeal of foreign countries may wane sirkin says “china gets more expensive every year by  chinese wages will average  per hour still well below the us minimum wage but american worker productivity is significantly higher when you consider all the factors the true cost to manufacture goods from china will be only about  percent cheaper than to make them domestically in another few years” national security issues and an iffy supply chain are also concerns “natural disasters such as the  tsunami in japan can disrupt the product pipeline leading to shortages of parts products and long shipping delays” says john hoffecker a managing director of global business consultants alixpartners in new york by  the boston consulting group predicts cost advantages in electricity natural gas and labor over japan and several european countries in a range of industries will give us exports a big boost as a result the group says the us could add as many as  million to  million manufacturing jobs by the end of the decade jeff faux a distinguished fellow of the economic policy institute in washington dc is not sanguine about the nature of those jobs “when you think it through” he says “our default policy to compete in the global economy over the long run is to lower the wages and benefits of american workers and no one at the top will admit that there’s no question a few jobs are coming back however they’re jobs that once paid  per hour and are now paying  globalization isn’t the problem the problem is that we started to accelerate the opening of us markets to foreign goods but without preparing our workers for the brutalization of competition for  years leaders have said we need to train and upgrade the skills of american workers but it needs to be done before signing these trade agreements not after the fact” wolf range making it in america still it’s a stretch to say as is commonly heard that the us doesn’t make anything anymore in fact sirkin says the us makes about threequarters of all the manufactured goods including components it consumes the chemical and plastics industries are thriving thanks to declining natural gas prices and foreign automakers including bmw hyundai kia mercedes and volkswagen have opened plants in the us master lock returned “onshored” or   “insourced” in laborspeak  union jobs to its milwaukee lock factory among the companies that have dug in their heels and continued to manufacture domestically is lenox which says it’s the only maker of fine bone china in the us some companies are bucking the outsourcing trend even in industries that have largely fled the us large appliances electronics and apparel appliances in  michiganbased whirlpool manufactured most of its frontloading washers in germany now the company is in the midst of making a fiveyear  billion investment in usbased plants facilities and equipment of the products whirlpool sells in the us it makes  percent in us plants and it continues to ramp up production of frontloaders in ohio where it already makes dryers dishwashers freezers and toploaders “on the one hand us labor costs are often higher than in other countries” says casey tubman whirlpool’s general manager of cleaning “but when you look at the higher productivity for american workers and consider the fact that it’s very expensive to ship something as big as a refrigerator or washer we can quickly make up those costs” last year kitchenaid returned the manufacture of hand mixers from china to the us and ge opened two factories in kentucky to make hotwater heaters and refrigerators a spokesman for sears told us that “through our manufacturing partner electrolux more than  new american jobs will be created at a plant being built in memphis” there should be plenty of demand if the industry does come back about a third of respondents to our survey said they’d tried to buy usmade appliances during the past year and more than half of respondents perceived such appliances as having much or somewhat better quality than those made abroad pendleton portland collection blanket electronics few tvs cell phones or digital cameras are made in america but in december apple ceo tim cook said “next year we will do one of our existing mac lines in the united states” chinabased lenovo the world’s secondlargest personal computer maker announced last october that it would start making some pcs in north carolina bucking a trend “that has seen electronics manufacturing jobs migrate overseas for more than two decades” the company said and element electronics an american company has been assembling lcd tvs in its detroit factory since january  the company says that opting for domestic production was “an emotional decision    maybe even a patriotic choice” apparel the domestic industry has been scorched by job losses because of plentiful and cheap labor overseas more than  percent of clothes and shoes sold in america are made elsewhere according to jack plunkett of houstonbased plunkett research still the industry is gaining traction in the us there’s growth among designers with output too small to attract the interest of international manufacturers and among those who simply want to be part of a made in america movement and as youll read in american made but well made even some big names are offering at least a limited assortment of americanmade garments and accessories to build on the momentum president obama through the departments of commerce and labor last fall launched the “make it in america” challenge offering  million in grants to applicants who come up with the best proposals to encourage “insourcing” spur foreign investment and expand job opportunities through employee training programs close to home—mostly here’s a sampling of companies that make or assemble at least some of their products in the us note that a company’s entire output isn’t necessarily americanmade and some primarily american companies may have manufacturing facilities in more than one country to meet demand overseas product

looking for usmade products is important to most americans our national survey found that other corporate behavior matters at least as much we asked respondents all things being equal would you be more likely less likely or neither to buy from a company that       more likely less likely neither gives back to the local community    treats its workers well    expresses public support for causes you believe in    engages in environmentally friendly practices    is american not foreign    has manufacturing plants in your home state    american made but well made respondents to our survey praised the quality of usmade products  percent said that us clothing and shoes were of better quality than foreign goods  percent said “much better” and  percent said “somewhat better” just  percent said americancrafted clothing or shoes were of worse quality and almost  percent of americans said they had tried to buy usmade clothing or shoes within the past year no wonder more and more companies are adding at least a few usmade items to their product lines but no product is worth your hardearned dollars if it’s poorly made for a snapshot of how americanmade products measure up we bought one sample of six products from big brands and asked our experts to assess their quality price is what we paid brooks brothers cotton sport shirt  made in america from longstaple egyptian cotton woven in italy the fabric is smooth strong and unlikely to pill egyptian cotton is typical in fine sheets and shirts brooks brothers sweated the small stuff and the shirt has impeccable details the button holes are perfect the collar has interfacing that makes it “stand up and be noticed” our expert said the striped fabric on the back of the shirt lines up with the yoke and the yoke lines up with the collar “like a good wallpaper job” our expert noted there are gussets on the side of the tail and small pleats in the sleeve to help resist accidental tears the shirt also comes with two extra buttons one for the placket and another for the collar our only nitpick a few loose threads bottom line “it’s a wellmade highquality shirt” our expert said “with features that help it resist wear and touches you’d expect from a tailor” lands’ end ragg socks  these thick casual socks made in osage iowa are multicolored as the name “ragg” implies they’re  percent cotton  percent wool  percent nylon and  percent spandex the heel and toe are densely knit to keep those areas from wearing out a bit of spandex in the heel and toe adds strength elastic throughout helps the socks stretch and retain their shape over time but a raised seam across the top of the toe could irritate the foot and give a hiker blisters better socks have a smooth seam other drawbacks chaff in the wool the processor didn’t eliminate all field debris after the sheep was sheared loose threads and sloppy finishing at the top of the ankle   bottom line “construction could be better and you’d expect higher wool content for the price” our expert said llbean women’s braided leather belt  the leather isn’t buttersoft but it’s fine for a belt the braids are machine made and the belt made in california features simple flatcut leather with unfinished edges that could abrade over time the braid’s ends were taped before sewing and double backstitched to create sturdier seams the sewing is neat the buckle components fit together nicely and the metal prong that slips into the hole is well finished so it’s unlikely to snag on other materials bottom line “it’s well made overall” our expert said “and decent for the price” new balance  running shoe  it looks well built with doublestitching at most joints and good adhesion between the sole and upper but the synthetic materials seem cheap the shoe feels very stiff and inflexible materials could result in unusual wear because the materials aren’t porous the shoe is likely to retain heat it’s also somewhat heavier than many of today’s running shoes which tend to be very light the company’s plants are in maine and massachusetts bottom line “the shoes appear well made but are very stiff and use crudelooking materials” our expert said “for the money there are better choices” orvis cropped cotton pants for women  they’re made in california of a stretchy jersey knit like tshirt fabric but denser the two pockets aren’t pocket bags but are instead a single piece of fabric folded over itself—a cheaper design the pants have an elastic waistband a bar tack at each pocket to help prevent ripping a tshirtstyle hem and serged stitching that’s reinforced at seams to prevent unraveling sewing at the crotch and hem is neat but hanging threads as long as  inches could snag bottom line “the fabric is nice but the pants seem pricey for what they are” our expert said woolrich vintage throw  on one side this blanket made in woolrich pa is  percent wool and  percent nylon on the other it’s nubby polyester and acrylic sherpa fleece the fleece side is a stretchy double knit with a fuzzy texture to counterbalance the roughness of the wool on the flip side it has an oldfashioned look and the big loopy chain stitch around the edge adds to the handsewn feeling though it’s made by machine as is the rest of the blanket if the edge were to wear out the chain stitch would unravel but it’s purely decorative so the blanket would stay intact the sides are actually held together with a conventional serged seam that’s concealed from view bottom line “it’s a classic” our expert said “good fabric choices and construction details mean it’s something you’ll have for a very long time” car wars comparing pedigrees most vehicles are multinational even those with iconic american nameplates and many imports are surprisingly red white and blue case in point the chevrolet spark below left and toyota sienna below right only  percent of the chevy’s parts are american or canadian more than  percent including the engine are from korea where the vehicle is assembled and the automatic transmission is made in japan by contrast  percent of the sienna including its engine is american it’s assembled in indianawe know those facts because the american automobile labeling act requires passenger vehicles pickup trucks suvs and vans to bear labels specifying the value of their us and canadian parts as a percentage of the total value of all car parts the country of assembly and the country of origin of the engine and transmission that information is typically on the vehicle’s window sticker     email newsletters free email newsletterschoose from
