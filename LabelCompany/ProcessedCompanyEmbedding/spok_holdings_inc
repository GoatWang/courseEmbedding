hospital communications software effective hospital communications for modern day healthcare physician and caregiver communication is available instantaneously with today’s mobile devices the ability to communicate via hipaacompliant messaging software allows confidential patient information to be effectively shared via secure text messages or hospital pagers in timesensitive situations spok provides health systems with hipaacompliant communication solutions that integrate seamlessly with current operations on any type of device or combination of devices spok at the forefront of secure critical hospital communications with so many mobile devices in use organizations need to rely on an enterprise communication system that can share information with all of them different people need different devices depending on their roles some use smartphones or tablets others use pagers or wifi phones many rely on a combination a mobile device and email to receive information learn about mobile communications in these areas secure smartphone texting physician and caregiver communication preferences encrypted paging secure smartphone texting clinicians rely on smartphones tablets and increasingly wearables to provide fast accurate communications that are the underpinnings of patient care and safety secure texting apps address the need for protecting protected health information phi while messaging from these devices although many of these apps can be used at no cost to encrypt your text message that’s really all they can do with spok mobile you can simplify communications and strengthen care by also using your devices for patient consults and updates via thirdparty apps to access and send images and video receive secure code alerts and test results and much more talk to an expert at spok access the staff directory and oncall schedules mobile clinicians need the ability to easily message the right person on the right device spok mobile gives users instant access to the organization’s directory allowing staff to communicate with individuals or groups via encrypted text image and video messages staff can find individuals by name as well as searching for keywords such as “cardiology” facilitating faster consult requests and communication with oncall personnel referencing a centralized digital directory instead of a paper one gives users access to the most uptodate contact and oncall scheduling information to reach the right provider and improve care coordination security and encryption spok mobile uses industry best practices to guard the security of phi the solution offers a variety of security features including encryption application lock automated message removal passwordprotected inbox and remote device wipe to keep messages secure in accordance with guidelines from hipaa and the hitech act receive patient care alerts and test results a lot more than just a texting app spok mobile can receive alerts from patient monitoring systems such as heart monitors and ventilators when vital signs change it can also connect ordering providers with test results from the lab radiology and other departments enabling critical results to be seen quickly for fast response mobile device management mdm spok mobile integrates with mdm solutions like airwatch® mobileiron® and xenmobile® which gives endusers access to more security features this also gives health system it departments more control over the use of the application and content housed within the app physician and caregiver communication preferences many hospitals need pagers for certain staff members or to provide reliable coverage during disaster situations but they also need to message to smartphones wearables and other mobile tools this means maintaining a variety of communication devices to meet various needs the spok device preference engine enables you to not only support your staff by providing secure easy messaging to all of their devices but also to let them choose their preferred device for particular situations dpe considers factors such as message priority to route a textbased or voice message to the intended recipient on his or her preferred device for that situation the system can also add in escalation contacts in the event a message is not received and acknowledged in a predefined timeframe the solution improves patient care by connecting staff more quickly for important conversations it also reduces time spent calling around for doctors or waiting for responses encrypted paging although pagers have been a mainstay in hospitals for decades there’s no question that smartphones tablets and other devices have changed how people communicate in healthcare but while some physicians and other clinical staff have migrated to using smartphones for timesensitive communications pagers remain key for many personnel especially now that encrypted options are available for use in environments that demand hipaa compliance in fact in a  study of more than  hospitals  percent of the organizations used widearea paging and  percent used onsite paging many leading hospitals are still maintaining their proven affordable paging systems while adding many other device types to the mix the spok mobile secure texting app supports critical healthcare communications by integrating with the hospital’s directory and oncall information smartphones can work handinhand with pagers as both can receive alerts from patient monitoring nurse call and other communication systems via spok when hospitals evaluate communications technology finding a partner that offers the ability to send messages to a variety of devices is key pagers can complement secure text messaging in staff workflows many healthcare systems today integrate pagers into their workflows and secure communications along with smartphones in fact ‘device diversity’ is a powerful approach truly effective enterprisewide communications necessitate the ability to send various staff members a single message and have it received on whichever mobile device they carry hospitals need a communications approach that supports their workflows which likely means different devices for different staff hipaa compliance many people don’t realize that some pagers—such as the t and t available exclusively from spok— now offer an important advantage previously only available on smartphones equipped with a secure texting app encrypted communications encrypted pagers can provide a secure communication option that is also highly reliable even when cellular and wifi coverage is spotty this means that protected health information phi can be shared among staff on pagers and smartphones seamlessly to meet industry guidelines for sharing sensitive information tried true and cost effective the fact is that paging isn’t old technology it’s simple reliable technology its value remains high for critical messaging it’s not affected by lapses in cellular or wifi coverage additionally paging is exceptionally reliable and cost effective in fact for the daily price of a cup of coffee it’s possible to keep a pager on hand and ready to go there is still nothing even close to paging from a costeffectiveness perspective learn more about the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the hipaa privacy rule establishes national standards to protect
