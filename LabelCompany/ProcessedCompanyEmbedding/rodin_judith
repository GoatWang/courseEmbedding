paperbackverified purchasethe blue  brown books are fun to read they establish most of the concepts that are discussed in the pi these concepts are notated below along with page numbers my notes below indicate the page numbers where these concepts occur in the bb books as well as in the pi if you read the bb books you will have a relatively easy time recognizing the concepts but not necessarily understanding them as they are set forth when you read the pi you will know what to look out for additionally it seems that much of the first  pages of the pi is spent not doing philosophy but is spent reflecting about philosophy this  page span of reflection is apt to be particularly confusing unless one first reads the bb books the endresult of reading the bb books that is when you proceed to read the pi you will feel selfassured and happy in recognizing the same concepts and new variations of these concepts that appear in the pihere is some latebreaking news a few years after posting this review i finally published a real paper about wittgenstein the following paper contains several pages about wittgenstein that is about his analysis of the meaning of the word expectation my article got published in early brody t  obviousness in patents following the us supreme courts decision of ksr international co v teleflex inc in journal patent trademark office society to summarize ws philosophy first of all shows how the grammar of our language makes us think that mental acts or mental processes mental images or feelings of which we are conscious are required for our various language games again and again w discloses paper experiments demonstrating that mental acts of which we are conscious are not at all required for language games next w explains how our various language games are like games where these language games include meaning understanding referring commanding and so on w devotes much space to providing exercises disclosing different classes of language games where the exercises are meant to convince us that there is no essential mental act of which we are conscious finally w provides an answer as to what is essential for a word to transmit meaning understanding reference a command a request and the like however w provides only a sketchy answer namely that the answer lies in some institution or use notesmental act or mental process notion that meaning referring understanding depends on a mental image or a mental process wittgenstein explains how the grammar of the layperson gives birth to this notion wittgenstein explains that this is a false notion and at times makes fun of this notiona the mental image or mental process is like consulting a paradigm or prototype page    of bb booksb the mental image or mental process is like consulting a table page  of bb booksc the mental image or mental process is like accompaniment of another some kind of addition page   of bb books wittgenstein reveals what the layperson believes understanding and imagination to require a mental image or mental process wittgenstein says that the layperson exclaims but when i image something something certainly happens page  of pid you say to me you understand this expression    as if the sense were an atmosphere accompanying the word   page  of pie what really comes before our mind when we understand a wordisnt it something like a picture well suppose that a picture does come before your mind when you hear the word cube say the drawing of a cube page  of pif wittgenstein shows how we are tricked into thinking there is this mental act or mental process in an example of the language game of intending but didnt i already intend by way of a mental process the whole construction of the sentence    at its beginning so surely it already existed in my mind before i said it out loud    but here we are construing a misleading picture of intending    page  of pig wittgenstein says that the layperson says we sometimes call it thinking to accompany a sentence by a mental process    thus implying that this is how the layperson comes to think that language games must be accompanied by a mental processh wittgenstein says that the layperson comes to believe that language games require a mental image or mental process since the layperson has the false picture that the processes called    recognizing always consisted in comparing two impressions with one another it is as if i carried a picture of an object with me and used it to perform an identification of an object as the one represented by the picture page  of pii wittgenstein makes fun of the notion that language games require a mental image or mental picture when he writes that it is no more essential to the understanding of a proposition that one should imagine anything in connexion with it than that one should make a sketch from it page  of pij wittgenstein tells how the layperson is tricked into thinking that language games of understanding require a mental process or mental picture as the layperson is all to willing to say but when i imaging something or even actually see objects i have got something which my neighbor has not   i understand you you want to look about you and say at any rate only i have got this page  of pik a gun is fired in my presence and i say this crash wasnt as loud as i expected    was there a crash louder than that of a gun in your imagination page  of bb booksl i see someone pointing a gun and say i expect a bang the shot is fired    so did that bang somehow already exist in your expectation    did something of the shot already occur in my expectation page  of pim wittgenstein explains how we are tricked into thinking that the mental image or mental process exists wittgenstein points out that people generally agree to the proposition that the purpose of language is to express thoughtsso presumably the purpose of every sentence is to express a thought page  of pi wittgenstein points out that the laypersons agreement to this proposition is what makes the layperson believe that the mental images or mental process are necessary for language games page  of pin wittgenstein provides another example that shows that a mental act or a mental process need not accompany language games example of expecting we say i am expecting him when we believe that he will come though his coming does not occupy our thoughts page  of pio wittgenstein provides yet another example showing that language games do not require a mental image or mental process you were interrupted a while ago do you still know what you were going to say if i do know now and say itdoes that mean that i had already thought it before only not said it no page  of pip meaning referring understanding do not depend on mental acts mental acts of which we are conscious because of the fact that we can say napoleon was crowned in  and also mean the man who won the battle of austerlitz page   of bb booksq wittgenstein argues that meaning referring understanding are not dependent on a mental picture because we can say kings college is no fire even though if you did have a mental image there would be a dozen buildings that look just like that image page  of bb booksr when i think in language there arent meanings going through my mind in addition to the verbal expressions the language is itself the vehicle of thought page  of pis wittgenstein shows how the grammar of the layperson suggests that language games require a separate mental image or mental process one is tempted to use the following picture what he really wanted to say what he meant was already present somewhere in his mind even before we gave it expression page  of pit wittgenstein agrees that mental images do occur even though he says that they are not a necessary part of any language game with the exception of the language game of describing what you imagine the mental picture is the picture which is described when someone describes what he imagines page  of piu wittgenstein makes fun of the notion that a mental image blue is used when we use the language game of color of the word blue has anyone shewn me the image of the colour blue and told me that this is the image of blue page  of pifeelings feelings are a subset of mental acts or mental processes notion that language games eg meaning referring understanding intending depend on a mental process where the mental process is a feeling wittgenstein explains that this is a false notion and makes fun of this notion pages           of bb booksa feelings of familiarity page  of bb booksb relaxing of a strain page  of bb booksc feelings of tension or feeling relieved page  of bb booksd when i said give me an apple and a pear and leave the room had i the same feeling when i pronounced the two words and page  of bb bookse didnt i have a sort of homely feeling when i took in the word tree page  of bb booksgeneral properties of actual games games of sports cards board games and language games concept that that there are many different types of games that it is fruitless to define games by any single characteristic game that it is fruitless to find a common element in all games and that games are better defined by way of a family of resemblancesa wittgenstein states that the search for this common element is like attempting to strip off its particular costume or like trying to find the real artichoke by stripping off its leaves page  of bb booksb wittgenstein provides examples of the multitude of games for example bounded card games and unbounded card games page   of bb booksc a game is something characterized by a multitude of circumstances page  of bb booksd but if someone wished to say there is something common to all these constructions    one might as well say something runs through the whole threadnamely the continuous overlapping of these fibres     page  of pilist of language games wittgenstein uses these examples to demonstrate the absence of a mental image or mental process in these language games and also to demonstrate the existence of the family quality in these language gamesa languages game of can page  of bb booksb languages game of trying page  of bb booksc languages game of searching page  of bb booksd languages game of expecting page  of bb bookse languages game of familiarity page  of bb booksf languages game of color page  of bb booksg languages game of understanding page   i then try to remember what happened in my mind when i understood the words i did understand and when i didnt understand the others    this experiment will sow us a multitude of different characteristic experiences it will not show us any one experience which we should be inclined to call the experience of understanding    but opposed to these there will be a large class of cases in which i should have to say i know of no particular experience at all i just said yes or no wittgenstein then provides a list of these experiences page  of bb booksh languages game of sameness pages   of bb booksi languages game of observing page  of bb booksj languages games of recognizing page  of bb booksk languages games of thinking page  of bb books wittgenstein argues that the self observation of any mental image or mental act that occurs during thinking will not tell us what thinking is in order to get clear about the meaning of the word think we watch ourselves while we think what we observe will be what the word meansbut the concept is not used like that it would be as if without knowing how to play chess i were to try and make out what the word mate meant by close observation of the last move of some game of chess page  of pi here wittgenstein is implying that the language game of thinking requires context page  of pi say yes this pen is blunt    first thinking it then without thought then just think the thought without the words    but what constitutes thought here is not some process which has to accompany the words if they are not to be spoken without thought page  of pil languages games of willing volition intention page    is it time to get up he tries to make up his mind and then suddenly he finds himself getting up describing it this way emphasizes the absence of an act of volition wittgenstein also uses the example of volition to illustrate the game character of the language game of volition but there is not one common difference between so called voluntary acts and involuntary ones viz the presence or absence of one element the act of volition page  of bb booksm language games of belief page   of bb booksn language games of using a name or naming page  page  of pio language games of observing page  of bb booksp language games of deriving page  of bb booksq language game of similarity or having something in common page    of bb booksr language game of reading page  of bb bookss language games of interpreting drawings and yet one feels that what one calls the expression of the face a drawing is something that can be detached from the drawing of the face it is as though we could say this face has a particular expression namely this pointing to something    we are as it were under the optical delusion which    makes us think that there are two objects where there is only one the delusion is assisted by our using the verb to have saying the face has a particular expression page   of bb books see also page   of bb books here wittgenstein points out how the laypersons use of ordinary grammar makes him think that a mental image or mental process is needed in the language games of understanding of interpreting etc whereas in fact understanding interpretation etc comes from context or from an institutiont language games of interpreting music what is it like to know the tempo in which a piece of music should be played and the idea suggest itself that there must be a paradigm somewhere in our mind and that we have adjusted the tempo to conform to that paradigm but in most cases    i will    just whistle it in a particular way and nothing will have been present to my mind but the tune actually whistled not an image of that page  of bb books sing this tune with expression and now dont sing it but repeat its expressionand here one actually might repeat something for example motions of the body slower and faster breathing and so on page  of pi here wittgenstein seems to be showing how the laypersons use of grammar indicates that expression is a mental process separate from the singing page  of piu similarly in a discussion of the language game of recognition wittgenstein states that suppose the game    consisted in this that b should say whether he knows the object or not but does not say what it is suppose he was shown an ordinary pencil    what happened when he recognized it    the words oh this is a pencil did not refer to a paradigm the similarity of which with the pencil shown b had recognized asked what is a pencil be would not have pointed to another object as the paradigm or sample but could straight away have pointed to the pencil shown to him    he just reacted in this particular way by saying this word page  of bb booksv wittgenstein explains why the notion that a mental image or mental process is used in understanding interpreting etc a word or a drawing wittgenstein explains the word falls one is tempted to explain into a mould of my mind long prepared fro it but    i dont perceive both the word and a mould    page  of bb booksinstitutions context use situations wittgenstein concludes that meaning referring understanding etc depends on some connection to context uses institutions connectiona the meaning of a phrase for us is characterized by the use we make of it the meaning is not a mental accompaniment to the expression    i want to play chess and a man gives the white king a paper crown leaving the use of the piece unaltered but telling me that the crown has a meaning to him in the game    i say as long as it doesnt alter the use of the piece it hasnt what i call a meaning page  of bb booksb we refer by the phrase understanding a word not necessarily to that which happens while we are saying or hearing it but to the whole environment of the event of saying it page  of bb booksc wittgenstein indicates that meaning comes not from a mental image or mental process but from use what we call their meaning is not anything which they have got in them or which is fastened to them irrespective of what use we make of them page  of bb booksd regarding the language game of naming wittgenstein says we can therefore say that if naming something is to be more than just uttering a sound while pointing to something there must also be    the knowledge of how in the particular case the sound    is to be used page  of bb bookse this thought ties on to thoughts which i have had before    this thought is connected with those earlier thoughts and yet be unable to shew the connexion page  of pif of course if the meaning is the use we make of the word    but we understand the meaning of a word when we hear or say it we grasp it in a flash and what we grasp in this way is surely something different from the use which is extended in time    but can the whole use of the word come before my mind when i understand it in this way page  of pi one cannot guess how a word functions one has to look at its use and learn from that page  of pig an intention in language game of intending is embedded in its situation in human customs and institutions page  of pih this concerns the language game the color red what am i to say about the word red that it means something confronting us all and that everyone should really have another word besides this one to mean his own sensation of red or is it like this the word red means something known to everyone    page  of pi thus wittgenstein seems to say that meaning comes from something confronting us all from something known to everyonei the following concerns the language game of expecting an expectation is imbedded in a situation from which arises the expectation of an explosion may for example arise from a situation in which an explosion is to be expected page  of pij this concerns wittgensteins connection of language games with use it is as if we could grasp the whole use of the word in a flash   cant the usein a certain sensebe grasped in a flash page  of pi here wittgenstein seems to be suggesting how meaning comes from something other than a mental image or mental process a machine as symbolizing its actionsthe action of a machinei might say at firstseems to be there in nit from the start what does that meanif we know the machine everything else that is its movement seems to be already completely determine we talk as if these parts could only move in this way    the machines action seems to be in it from the start       the possible movements of a machine are already there in it in some mysterious way    page  of pik i have been trained to react to this sign in a particular way and now i do so react to it    a person goes by a signpost only in so far as there exists a regular use of sign posts a custom page  of pil to obey a rule to make a report to give an order to play a game of chess are customs uses institutions page  of pi comment  people found this helpful

paperbackverified purchasethe blue book is concerned with an exploration of meaning in language reputedly one of wittgenstein most direct and accesible works it is subtle and containing many of his ideas that appear in the previous tractatus and later investigations a good dose of semiotics is needed to organise his ideas in a context more accessible to the casual reader interested in linguistics and neuropsychologycomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not found only

of  starswaiting for itbyim thinkingon may  format paperbackverified purchasethis may seem ostentatious to write a review prior to reception but from the minimal glimpse of this book afforded me by amazons peeking feature i can see that this is a great book philology and language analysis are hardly my forte or general interests but this nestles with symbolism and therefore is in a vein of epistemology and heuristics that i am very much inclined for attributions signs ascription frames of understanding and the like seem to be addressed in this book it is sad and superficial for me to state that what brought me to purchase this book is its title having not tackled any wittgenstein prior i read one comment stating that this might be a hard read but after gilles deleuze and karl marx

social innovations q  a judith rodin judith rodin is funding new innovation processes like crowdsourcing and collaborative competitions share comment download print order reprints related stories by eric nee summer  judith rodin heads the rockefeller foundation one of the world’s oldest most influential and innovative foundations many of the th century’s big breakthroughs—social security the green revolution the discovery of dna and family planning—can be traced to early funding from the rockefeller foundation today rodin is doing her best to keep the rockefeller foundation at the forefront of new and big ideas the foundation continues to fund organizations tackling specific problems like poor health care and environmental degradation but rodin has taken a different tack by also funding organizations that are creating new innovation processes—like crowdsourcing and collaborative competitions—which can be applied to solving all types of social problems in this interview with stanford social innovation review managing editor eric nee rodin explains the impact that the economic downturn has had on the rockefeller foundation and its grantmaking ability she goes on to discuss in some detail why the foundation is funding organizations developing new innovation processes and which processes are proving most fruitful and last rodin explains how the rockefeller foundation is adapting its grantmaking to the new opportunities provided by the obama administration eric nee how is the economic downturn affecting the rockefeller foundation judith rodin nobody foresaw the magnitude of the economic crisis or the rapidity with which it occurred our endowment was down somewhere in the neighborhood of  percent at the end of ’ and we will undoubtedly be well over our traditional  percent payout this year but our investment managers were attentive to the market turbulence and in early  we took out a sizable line of credit with a large bank with access to that money we did not have to sell our holdings into a declining market to meet our grantmaking needs we plan to honor all of our approved grants and move forward with all of our ongoing initiatives the rockefeller foundation has been around for more than  years and with the confidence of that history we’re well positioned to weather this financial crisis what lessons did the foundation learn from going through the great depression just as the federal government saw the opportunity to initiate major programs during that time of need so too did the rockefeller foundation it spent substantial resources on significant programs such as the development of social security we are planning to do the same thing now what impact will the economic downturn have on nonprofits clearly there will be fewer nonprofits at both the level of givers and the level of grantees this may be the moment for consolidation in an “industry”—in quote marks—that’s really proliferated and where there may not have been the incentive or the motivation for economies of scale and so regrettably this may be an opportunity for that i also think that innovation is going to be critical accomplishing more with less working together leveraging resources sharing data and creating models for change that can be more easily replicated all of these things are going to be absolutely urgent in this economic climate you mentioned innovation one of the rockefeller foundation’s program areas is funding innovation can you explain what you are doing in that area innovation is not just a product it’s a process we want to focus our funding on the how not just on the what we’re funding organizations that are at the cutting edge of the process of innovation our hope is that those processes can be used by lots of different organizations in lots of different fields what we’ve found is that a lot of the innovative processes that have been created in the private sector can be applied to solving not forprofit social challenges in the fields in which we work—health care economic security climate change poverty alleviation and capacity building we’re focusing our efforts on two core innovation ideas first that the most successful solutions will often come from the place where you’d least expect them here we are funding organizations involved in crowdsourcing techniques and collaborative competitions second that the innovations that focus on the user often lead to extraordinary and we think different outcomes here we are funding organizations focused on userdriven innovation let’s talk about the first type of innovation model you mentioned crowdsourcing we began with a partnership with a forprofit company called innocentive that has linked together a network of about  engineers scientists and entrepreneurs around the world they use a webbased platform to gather solutions to problems that have confounded people working in just one place such as an rd department at a large pharmaceutical company hundreds or even thousands of people who have never met and never will compete to solve a problem the best solution which is determined by the organization that posted the problem wins a prize we thought this would be an amazing platform for finding solutions to world problems i’ll give you an example bogolight had developed a solarpowered flashlight and wanted to expand on that to develop a product that could light a whole room for people who had no electricity so they posted the problem on innocentive the winner was a scientist in new zealand someone with whom bogolight which is based in houston would never have come into contact just as important bogolight said the process was much more economical and allowed them to see the problem differently the new light is now being used in african villages and in the gaza strip one of the interesting things is how many of the solvers have sent emails back to innocentive saying “i can’t tell you how fantastic it feels to be working on social problems it’s not that i don’t like the prize money and i like working on the forprofit problems too but it feels terrific to be working on socially important problems that i know can help people” who are you funding in the area of collaborative competitions an example is changemakers an ashoka founded ngo here again our interest is in the process at innocentive the problem solvers don’t see one another’s solutions but at changemakers all of the solutions are posted so that everyone can read them and perhaps build on one another’s solutions they aren’t in the same room but they can collaborate virtually making it possible to create a different and better solution it’s through collaborative revision and iteration that the best ideas come and new and creative solutions are developed cocacola for example sponsored a global water challenge at changemakers they were looking for ways to help impoverished communities gain access to sanitation and drinking water almost  competing applications came in from  countries four of these entrants were named winners and are splitting  million to create scalable replicable and sustainable models that can be applied around the world the second type of process that you are funding is userdriven innovation can you explain what that is the design firm ideo is one of the best practitioners of userdriven innovation their concept is that innovations are most successful if the people who will be using the product or the service are given a real voice in the development process ideo usually works with large forprofit companies to help design new products and services we funded ideo to work with nonprofits to help solve social problems one grantee they’ve been working with is conversion sound a social enterprise that develops hearing aids for poor people in rural india through the ideo process they discovered that because authority commands such respect particularly in the rural parts of india hearing aid technicians would be more effective if they wore uniforms it’s certainly not something that i would have thought of or even thought was important but the users identified this as critical in this instance a small change in the program made a very big difference another example of userdriven innovation is the work done by positive deviance a group at tufts university their idea is that every community has positive outliers people who stand out because their behavior is different from most of the other people in the group and because they are more successful what positive deviance does is identify the behaviors that have made these outliers successful and then teach and institutionalize these behaviors to others in the group positive deviance gets credit for showing what reduced hospital acquired infections they found that in hospitals where the infection rate was very low individuals were using hand sanitizers and that that was not the case systematically in those hospitals with high infection rates positive deviance spread those practices to other hospitals with our funding positive deviance is trying to figure out ways to decrease corruption in governments of developing countries they’re identifying the behaviors of the most ethical public officials in developing countries and what behaviors they engage in to root out waste fraud abuse and corruption and then they are trying to generalize and teach those behaviors their belief is that some of the abuse comes from lacking the skills to behave ethically rather than simply looking for fraudulent ways to hurt people how does the rockefeller foundation get these lessons and skills about innovative processes out to the rest of the world that is the critical question we think innovation is a skill that can be taught our innovation initiative has three parts the first part which i’ve already described is to make the grants to do the work the second part is monitoring and evaluating the work this involves not only measuring success in the more traditional terms—does the innovation work—but also evaluating whether the process made the work of the grantee better different more costeffective and a whole cascade of other parameters the third part is to disseminate the process through conferences written materials and other means our success will be realized only if all of this spreads and goes to scale we’ve already begun bringing the grantees together both actually and virtually to share what they have learned one of the things we are also doing is to turn the lens on ourselves and ask are we the rockefeller foundation and the philanthropy sector as a whole using these innovation tools and techniques if we are are we using them as effectively as we might and if we’re not can we go through the same kind of training that we’ve been doing with our grantees we’ve held one workshop for several foundations that were interested in embarking on this journey with us and we’ve held a couple of workshops for ourselves if we really get good at this we believe that by using some of these innovation practices we can make up for some of the financial cuts in our endowment let’s talk about president obama what impact will his administration have on the foundation’s work we did a national poll last summer with time—well before the economic crisis really hit what we found is that americans want new public policies they want government and their employers to enter into a new kind of social contract americans also understand that their roles will have to change and that the st century is going to demand different things of them as well we were struck by their embrace of government so i think president obama has that mandate the opportunity for innovation is real in part because resources are limited whether it’s innovation in public policy whether it’s a white house office of social innovation whether it’s new kinds of models of publicprivate partnership all of these are going to be necessary i don’t think it’s a choice between public and private approaches to solving social problems it’s going to require all of the sectors we may need to redefine the roles of each and how they interact but the problems are so big that we need both the markets and the public sector to engage but we need them to engage in different ways that’s what this discussion in washington and literally around kitchen tables everywhere in the united states is really all about what is the rockefeller foundation doing now to take advantage of this situation we worked on the economic stimulus bill trying to draw attention to issues like infrastructure climate change and the environment poverty and urbanization some of our grantmaking has changed to capitalize on this shift as well we just funded a conference at nyu’s furman center called “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste” this conference looked at the mortgage and housing crisis and asked “what are the opportunities for new ideas about homeownership and how mortgages and financing need to occur” the new us department of housing and urban development secretary shaun donovan was a keynote speaker you launched a new program last summer called campaign for american workers how has that program adjusted to the new economic and political reality it was very clear to us that the growing inequality around the world was going to have enormous impact and that government was not providing major solutions to that set of issues so as we thought about this we said “has the social contract for the th century now changed so much that we really ought to examine what the st century contract should be” the campaign for american workers is an effort to produce new social research and create new public policy solutions all motivated toward increasing the economic security of the american worker our view is that you can’t use protectionist trade policies or immigration policies to solve that problem it’s about doing what america has always been good at which is growing the pot through innovation and economic development and expanding the workforce what are some programs that you have funded in this area one example is the tax policy center which has developed the idea of a guaranteed retirement account if workers don’t have access to a conventional defined benefit pension plan they could contribute  percent of their income to the plan and the government would pay the first  percent of that amount and then the employer would kick in another  percent it’s similar to a k the difference is that the money is deposited into an individual account with the social security administration which pools the money and puts it into relatively conservative investments are you optimistic about the future i think we will find solutions this is an amazing opportunity for americans we can’t afford to squander it because it’s a onceinageneration opportunity     free weekly enewsletter email

day its okay to be afraid because you cant be brave or courageous without fear dave chappelle comedian remarks by judith rodin at the november  bsr annual conference  the rockefeller foundation about usnews  media remarks by judith rodin at the november  bsr news  media remarks by judith rodin at the november  bsr annual conference november   good evening i want to thank aron cramer and his incredible team for putting together another inspiring productive exhausting week but as you know bsr’s good work is more than just excellent conferences they are an incredible partner for so many of us in thinking through how we can bring together publicprivate partnerships to solve large pressing challenges and build better businesses in the process building resilience offers us one of those dual opportunities this week you’ve heard from the crème de la crème of resilience thinking and doing you’ve covered a range of topics from building resilient businesses to becoming resilient leaders to thinking about resilience in the face of climate change you’ve heard from ceos csos and even cros—the first cohort of chief resilience officers who are leading cities in the  resilient cities network pioneered by the rockefeller foundation and you’ve networked among your peers sharing insights best practices and a few war stories along the way if there is one mantra to sum up these proceedings the next poster for your office wall it may be the words of business strategist andrew winston who wrote “an extreme world calls for extreme change” and we are indeed living in an extreme world crisis has become the new normal thanks to the combining forces of globalization urbanization and climate change not a week goes by that we don’t feel some disturbance that affect our businesses or the economy or geography that surrounds them maybe it’s an attack on our systems a data breach or technology glitch maybe it’s a disruption in our communities standing here in san francisco our minds go immediately to earthquakes and forest fires but we are also seeing the effects of the slower burning stresses—drought air pollution and wealth inequality—on the communities and businesses here other crises come from the inside a massive product recall with no alternative sources for backup material like lululemon faced a few years ago or the scandal volkswagen is currently caught up in you might not think of these as resilience challenges but they are and any one of them could take a business or even an industry down in some weeks it’s all of these disruptions but if we spend so much time putting out fires and responding to emergencies we miss out on new opportunities to grow our businesses to unleash new innovations to reach the full potential of our careers and our companies and while it’s true that small challenges are good tests that can lead to transformations businesses should be taking deliberate planned proactive risks rather than be in the position of reacting resilience thinking gives businesses the upper hand when you invest in resilience building not only do you spend less time and energy responding and reacting you see dividends—resilience dividends—in the form of greater consumer loyalty higher employee morale and yes greater profits there are three ways that companies can achieve these resilience dividends first organizations must begin by building resilience from the inside out this means more than just establishing business continuity plans it requires embedding resilience at all levels of the culture a textbook case study is toyota motor corporation before the japanese earthquake in  the automaker had learned from past crises and established disaster response task forces in every operation unit but leadership did more than that it had taken care to build the kind of culture that empowered its employees and its suppliers to gather and share information quickly make decisions and do what needed to be done to get car parts to manufacturers and deliver cars to customers—during good times and in times of crisis when the earthquake struck toyota’s leaders not only called into action the disaster response task forces that had been established the company’s president akio toyoda delegated his authority to the people on the ground despite a production loss of about  vehicles within a month all of toyota’s major plants in japan were running by the end of june  percent of production had been restored and in two years toyota had regained its top position while other businesses in japan still even four years later are struggling to recover so start with building a culture that promotes greater resilience second the private sector can benefit from a hugely untapped market for innovating resilience products and services some companies have made resilience building one of their new business lines for example veolia is a company dedicated to helping customers solve their environmental and sustainability challenges in boston for instance veolia’s innovative underground energy system recaptures and reuses environmentallyfriendly thermal energy or “green steam” which is reducing greenhouse gasses equivalent to removing  cars from the roads and increasing air quality but it is also powering nearly  customers in the central business district and biotech corridor in nearby cambridge that’s the resilience dividend other companies are innovating new product and service lines that answer the question “what do people cities or businesses need to prepare for withstand and grow in transform in the face of shocks and stresses” for example big data companies are innovating platforms to help cities analyze their resilience challenges new orleans is working with palantir to understand and then fix more effectively with one solution problems arising from the interlinked geographical overlap of crimes poverty school dropout rates and environmental hazards so  your companies can innovate around resilience products and services creating new market opportunities third be a critical partner in building resilience in the cities and communities where you are located take the current drought crippling the west coast the tourism industry in las vegas is a huge consumer of water but they’ve recognized they have a role to play in building the resilience of their region for example the mgm grand directed its restaurants to make a simple but important change by thawing frozen meat in a meat cooler overnight rather than under running water one restaurant alone has saved  million gallons of water in a year and saw significant savings on their water bill that’s just one restaurant imagine the dividends if all of the restaurants on the strip made this one simple change in this example building resilience isn’t just about environment sustainability but also yielding resilience dividends by advancing more inclusive economies—where everyone including your customers employees and neighbors have access to opportunities this is a theme i hope to explore further with aron and share some of the good work bsr and the rockefeller foundation are doing in this area but first let me end by saying that while an extreme world calls for extreme change it also presents an extreme opportunity  percent of the jobs that will exist in ten years haven’t even been invented yet seventy percent of the urban infrastructure needed by  has not yet been built thousands of products and services that will be a part of daily life haven’t even been imagined many of those jobs and those products will be a direct result of seizing opportunities to manage and limit disruption build resilience and thrive in an extreme world and i have no doubt that the individuals who will be leading those boardrooms and who will create those product lines are sitting at these tables here tonight ready to put what you’ve seen heard and dreamed this week into practice come monday the future of your business and our society may depend on it bio judith rodin judith rodin is a pioneer innovator changemaker and global thoughtleader read full bio sign up for enews × subscription options email thank
