of the financial measures and ratios we present including tangible book value and tangible book value per share metrics are supplemental measures that are not required by or are not presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we refer to these financial measures and ratios as nongaap financial measures we consider the use of select nongaap financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating periodtoperiod comparisons we believe that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting analyzing and comparing past present and future periods these nongaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with gaap and you should not rely on nongaap financial measures alone as measures of our performance the nongaap financial measures we present may differ from nongaap financial measures used by our peers or other companies we compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent gaap measures whenever we present the nongaap financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the nongaap financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance the company does not provide a reconciliation of forwardlooking nongaap financial measures to its comparable gaap financial measures because it could not do so without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of the information needed to calculate reconciling items and the variability complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the nongaap financial measures in future periods when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods the company does so primarily on a nongaap basis without preparing a gaap analysis as that would require estimates for various cash and noncash reconciling items including items such as expected credit losses stockbased compensation acquisition and dispositionrelated expenses and restructuring costs that would be difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy for example future expectations for credit losses depend on a variety of factors including general economic conditions that make estimation on a gaap basis impractical  similarly equity compensation expense would be difficult to estimate because it depends on the companys future hiring and retention needs as well as the future fair market value of the companys common stock all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change it is also difficult to anticipate the need for or magnitude of a presently unforeseen onetime restructuring expenses as a result the company does not believe that a gaap reconciliation to forwardlooking nongaap financial measures would provide meaningful supplemental information about the companys forwardlooking measures
