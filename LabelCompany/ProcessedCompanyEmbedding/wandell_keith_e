– booyah by every financial measure harleydavidson generated improvements in the second quarter of  with strong earnings growth increased shipments and growth in its dealers’ new motorcycle sales both

may used bikes sales continue to firm up meaning they offer the dealer a method to help offset the “sticker shock” of new bikes did anything go less positive  well that depends on your viewpoint  from a shareholder’s perspective it’s “houston we’re ready to throttle up”   stock price set a new week high at  as a riderlayman the touring motorcycle shipment increases were offset by the decreases in custom and sportster declines  there were no age demographics quoted in the analyst call but we’ve been told that typically “youngsters” don’t buy the higher priced baggers  in addition the new  touring models that were announced earlier in the month have… shall we say… “lean” engineering innovation compared to previous years  in a number of cases there we’re only paint palette changes and price increases made up the socalled “new” touring models  there was about a  price increase in the us market  the lack of innovation is especially troubling to me given that product development spending was up m in the first half of  which was described as a continuation of their strategy and focus on leaner engineering  sure metals and fuel costs are up but the lack of stronger product changes is not always a recipe for long term success nothing was noted on the call about the recent expansion in india  not sure why given that sga expenses were up about m on the strategy to grow  –  international dealers by   latin america saw a decrease in retail sales which was largely due to all brazil dealers being terminated  there was a restart in that country and the new dealers  were

new  model from harleydavidson was inadvertently released to the public by the california environmental protection agencyair resources board  no details have been released or provided by the motor company but according to carb’s online listing of  hd models that the agency approved the new models show up here if the information is complete it looks like three motorcycles are being discontinued softail cross bones softail rocker and street glide trike  there are additional models getting the  cu inch and the new “switchback” which is getting its name for the ability to be switched back and forth from touring to nontouring  isn’t that the same as a convertible which has been out for  years now  there is also what looks to be a new th anniversary vrod model water cooled vtwin it might be premature on my part but these new models don’t look like a major transformation underway in product development  it looks more like a really big yawn vs true innovation  the fact that keith e wandell president and ceo a position he has held since may  has pontificated in every earnings call about the new direction for harleydavidson through the development and implementation of a strategic plan based on the core tenets of growth continuous improvement leadership development and sustainability… which includes expansion of the company’s global reach and product development transformations along with manufacturing capabilities for improved responsiveness is lacking  i’ll reserve final judgment until the actual  release at the end of july but at this point i find myself asking is “switchback” code word for a return to the old axiom…if it sticks out chrome it if breaks make it bigger and if it’s ugly paint it black and speaking of innovation check out this link to cyril huze’s blog about a water cooled patent that hd filed over a year ago… it seems to have resurrected a worldwide discussion on when will water cooled vtwins finally hit the market  obviously not in  but maybe in  update june   – partial release of the new  models occurred about a month early  see url here update july  – the hd “switchback” was rolled out at the anaheim ca dealer meeting this morning and

christmas snow sculpting tom queoff tomahawk on december   leave a comment » this holiday season i want to thank all of you for your continued support and wish you a merry christmas and a happy new years below is a little poem i crafted for the harley team… december   ‘twas the night before christmas when all through the harley house not a manager was stirring not even a supervisor mouse annual reviews were hung by the hr door with care in hopes yearend bonuses soon would be there directors nestled all snug in their beds while dreams of promotion danced in their heads ms tonit in snowflake sweater and me in my suspenders we’d just settled down to write our yearenders when from the rd floor there came such a clatter i sprang from my desk to attend to the matter clutching my iphone i flew up the stairs wondering what marketingcaused mayhem i might find there with the moon high above the tomahawk facility it cast a glow over financial services billing  eligibility when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a mediumheight chap looking quite cavalier that glass in his hand so clearly a red zinfandel i knew in a moment keith e wandell more rapid than eagles his lieutenants they came as he whistled and shouted and called them by name “now dasher now dancer  you curator bill on joanne on markhans on enrico you work here still” “into my office at the end of the hall now dash away dash away dash away all” up they lined like toy soldiers taking up residence it was a small army of regular and senior vice presidents and then keith began banging on his shiny new laptop “yes friday’s are casual day but this plant absenteeism has to stop” i spoke not a word and was turning around when out of his blackandorange chair the boss came with a bound his eyes — how they twinkled and this i must say his cheeks were like roses all red like a football fan on a cold packers day his holiday necktie drawn up tight like a bow and the bald of his head was as white as the snow he had a broad face and the harley tshirt showed a little ceo belly that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly he wasn’t chubby nor plump just a jolly old elf and i smiled when i saw him in spite of everyone else a wink of his eye and a nod of his head soon let us know that hd vp’s had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but with fingers quite soft he started filling envelopes so fast it made him cough and laying a finger aside of his nose he gave a wave and twist down the elevator he goes he sprang up on his motorcycle sidecar to his team gave a shout “to miller park” he cried it’s time to chill out” and i heard him exclaim as he throttled away “i have envelopes for all and for all have a great harley ridin’ day” photo courtesy of tom queoff usa snow sculpting team

comment » i’m talking about kingfisher beer was introduced into india by the british who eventually set up a brewery that produced asia’s first beer — a pale ale called lion however these days lager is the only type of beer you’ll find available in india and “the king of good times” is kingfisher it’s india’s most recognized and widely available beer its name has been associated with sports fashion and even an airline and sooner than anyone would have thought… in bawal india a harleydavidson assembly line worker will be having a kingfisher and relaxing with coworkers but i’ve gotten ahead of myself…  let’s jump into the the way back machine and set the dial for —  “the fact is we must focus both our effort and our investment on the harleydavidson brand as we believe this provides an optimal path to sustained meaningful longterm growth” said ceo keith wandell at the october   announcement to discontinue production of buell motorcycles  on october   the last buell lightning xbscg rolled off the company’s east troy wisconsin assembly line  it was the last of the  motorcycles built in the company’s  years of operation harleydavidson street  it was a combination of factors in making the decision but essentially the global recession forced a reckoning and harleydavidson decided to refocus on its tent pole products or what i’d call doubling down on its core lineup of heavyweight bikes  as a result the motor company abandoned entry level motorcycles buell blast exited the sport bike buell and sold mv and thumb their noses at the adventure market buell ulysses   in the process the motor company made a lot of motorcycle enthusiasts upset about what looked like a myopic approach of only looking at spreadsheets versus doing a bit more market research and addressing a need jump ahead years and witness the financial rebound of the company and the launch this week of the new harleydavidson street  and street  motorcycles  could it be a buell blast redeux  the smaller cc motorcycle basically fills a void left when they discontinued the buell motorcycle line which included the cc buell blast  more important in this announcement is the fact that the motorcycles will be made both in the us and bawal india marking the first time the company will manufacture a complete motorcycle at an overseas facility  i’ll repeat that… the first time the company will manufacture a complete motorcycle outside the us harleydavidson street  side view the manufacturing news in of itself will be fodder for many future blog posts but sticking to the motorcycle announcement the new ‘street’ bikes are the first harleydavidson motorcycles to be designed from scratch since the vrod  years ago it makes this road glide owner wonder if that’s an indicator of where all the engineers were redirected in lieu of updating the ‘glide’ with the all new project rushmore features that were incorporated into the new  touring models the fact is the company has aggressively expanded its marketing efforts because realistically there is no replacing white baby boomer men and this means they have to attract younger men noncaucasian men women and do that from countries as disparate as india italy brazil and the us with much more success  by turning inwards relying on a singlebrand tradition and nationalism over the last years and divesting itself of brands that were dimming the lights on a brighter future–the motor company can and now has expanded into other segments at the street  announcement the harleydavidson ceo keith wandell said “the younger riders don’t want their dad’s chromedout harley” “they want the dark custom sinister look the ability to rebel” sounds like a bit of marketing spin but with more than half of its dealerships outside the us harleydavidson has really put a lot of investment behind a push to expand and broaden its customer base including new motorcycle buyers–worldwide photo’s courtesy of hd and kingfisher  note

th anniversary ceo cold weather down  earnings earnings report hd harleydavidson harleydavidson ceo keith wandell hd keith e wandell q revenue sales weather on april    comment » you’re the ceo and going down your quarterly earnings check list still in business after  years – check secured music talent for th anniversary party – check number one seller of motorcycles to young adults  – check increase  first quarter revenue to b up  vs b a year earlier — check increase  first quarter income to m vs m a year earlier – check hog shares up  to closed at  – check us dealers sold  new motorcycles down  from a year earlier – ooops colder temperatures and the wet climate set the stage for the quarterly sales miss  at least according to harleydavidson ceo keith wandell who stated in last week’s earnings call… “by far the vast majority of the sales decline was weather related” interesting  the earnings call didn’t signal any major marketing changes for the brand instead pinning some of the losses on external factors such as rainfall in many parts of the country the weak economy and the unseasonably cold weather are the only unemployed consumers who keep getting rained on harleydavidson consumers generally speaking home sales and auto sales are up  it would seem that management neglected to remind us about superstorm sandy how federal tax returns have been delayed and how fuel prices are unsettling to consumers  to be fair some retail outlets selling spring apparel home and garden were depressed due to wintry conditions but looking at the weather for an impact on harleydavidson consumer spending seems a bit trivial i spent the last week in arizona and if you plotted temperatures from dawn until noon you’d observe an alarming warming trend  if you extended that trend line for the next months you’ll clearly notice that ice caps will melt and the poor polar bears will be swimming more we’ll soon know if the good weather in the upcoming quarter provides a

person think they’re a sap – for investing in sap ag harleydavidson’s thirdquarter earnings were income from continuing operations at  million on consolidated revenue of  billion compared to income from continuing operations of  million or  per share on consolidated revenue of  billion in the yearago quarter through nine months harleydavidson income from continuing operations increased  percent yearoveryear to  million or  per share on consolidated revenue of  billion compared to income from continuing operations of  million or  per share on consolidated revenue of  billion in the yearago period “the third quarter marked a pivotal milestone in harleydavidson’s transformation with the launch of the erp production system at york a major piece of our restructuring work is behind us we are now focused on optimizing the system and look forward to the start of seasonal surge production early next year” said keith wandell chairman president and chief executive officer like partners in a threelegged foot race both the management and employees were hobbled by their connection to this socalled new erp production system at the company’s largest assembly plant  how ironic  a new production system being implemented to improve manufacturing performance becomes part of the problem that resulted in comments during the call like “harleydavidson’s annual new model launch was pushed to late august from late july” “new motorcycle sales were adversely affected by a limited availability of new motorcycles in july august and early september”  and leaving no deflection rock unturned… “the economy remains fragile and there’s a lot of uncertainty for highend products like a brand harleydavidson like ours” no mention in the call about the milwaukee hq it jobs outsourced in july to india infosys and if that had an impact on q nothing mention in the call whether what i feel has to be the lamest slogan “great motorcycles” on the th anniversary models is creating sales issues  it

california  weather there were more yettobe licensed benzes ferraris and porsches over a threemile stretch than i’ve seen in the past year  and here i was in an ultracool nissan cube rental arm out the window and for a few blocks comingling with the rich and famous speaking of… did you read that the harleydavidson president and ceo keith wandell opted not to have his base salary increased in  according to a proxy statement filed with the us securities and exchange commission on the surface this – “we’re all in it together” – grand gesture would make a person believe that a ceo who accepts a zero increase in salary is saying they’re a team player who wants to make a sacrifice for the good of the company  after all wasn’t it harleydavidson management that laidoff hundreds of workers closed plants and obtained impressive union concessions in a new multitiered workforce structure for the survival of the company call me cynical but when i hear about these it seems more like “camouflage” to deflect scrutiny off the extraordinary set of ceo benefits or at minimum to get publicity and produce significant positive shortterm market reaction in fact there are a number of reports which suggest these type of salary tactics are nothing but a ruse or smokescreen as a number of ceos have adopted these pay schemes  it’s the kind of opportunistic behavior from those wealthier more confident influential ceo’s rather than sacrificial acts they are ‘projected’ out to be i certainly don’t know if or what mr wandell’s intent was but we do know his total compensation in  rose nearly  to about  million compared with  million in   we also know the motor company paid mr wandell a bonus of  in   he also received a base salary of  in  equal to his salary in  and to be clear this post isn’t about wealth envy or whining about how it must be nice to be rich  we all know that rich people and bankers are beating the system  they’re writing off multithousand dollar meals with rare wines at places with unlisted phone numbers that youi can’t get into  unless you just woke up in north korea then you know that in america if you don’t like what you earn where you work or what you do for a living then you’re entitled to leave quit and go start a company further your education or do whatever the hell you want  it’s clear that company’s exist to make a profit for their shareholders and if the shareholders don’t like what the ceo is doing or earning then they can fire the board of directors to include the ceo but wait there’s even more  mr wandell received total cash bonus payments both discretionary and performancebased totaling more than  million in  compared with cash bonus payments of about  million in   his stock awards were valued at  million compared with  million in  while his option awards were valued at  million compared with  million the previous year  he also received “other” compensation totaling about  in  compared with about  in  the payments included  in lieu of receiving certain perquisites and personal benefits nonqualified deferred compensation plan contributions of  k plan contributions of  and life insurance premiums of  he also received additional benefits that totaled  consisting of financial planning services personal use of company aircraft and clothing what’s the punch line well given that mr wandell has made things happen meaning that as “head honcho” he made moves that hd insiders historically shied away from  he played hardball with dealers shed crappy brands cut labor contracts made major job cuts and closed plants some folks were let go just prior to christmas but unfazed he continued to trim the fat and raised cash by selling some old investments like harley’s semisecret test track in the everglades  he also challenged harley’s own traditional norms by altering its marketing strategy to attract nontraditional segments like women and minorities  he also embarked on an international growth strategy that will eventually bring the all the products the parts the lifestyle and the american vtwin to enthusiasts worldwide  the financial numbers speak for themselves all this from a guy who came to the motor company and did not even ride any kind of motorcycle  he’s earned a raise  how hard is it to understand… harley success  industry success photo taken by author’s iphone and postprocessed in

exuberant minds of two friends william s harley and arthur davidson started working on a project which was to overcome a hurdle of climbing hills on a cycle in the nearby up hills they planned to equip their cycle with a motorized engine to solve this situation and utilized a garage space in the house of mr davidson where the very first engine with a capacity of  cc was developed and fit into a cycle what started as a mere experiment went on to become one of the most iconic brands in motorcycle industry which is sought after by people across age groups and borders alike and has created a niche for itself by providing out of the box designs and latest technology constantly changing with times and in fact remaining abreast sometimescurrently after more than  years of its inception the company is headed by ceo keith ewandell and has operations in almost all major countries across the globe and a strong employee base of more than  this paper is focused on the marketing function of harley davidson and bring forth its marketingmix and related strategiesproduct in the marketing mix of harley davidsonfrom the very beginning harley davidson has maintained a certain level of wow factor in providing its bike models in the market and has always aimed at heavily built bikes which contain a strong engine which gives both power and the trademark thumping sound which in a way is also its identity another trademark of harley davidson are its design which are customized as per the biker and there are so many unique bik designs that even the customer is spoilt for choice all the designs are dashing and most importantly unique to harley davidson only these bikes are considered as “mean machines” that inspire awe and enchant millions with uniquely benchmarked shapes and designing harley davidson is the icon in terms of highway cruising bikes which allows long stretch drives inspired from widespread road network of its parent company heavy and high displacement engines have been an inseparable part of harley davidson association which have been known to bear any condition and outperform in severity in all they offer customers variety of models to choose from apart from dealing with accessories and engines that can be traded cheaply as the bikes are highly customizable and option windows are open to its customers and prospectssalient points for product in the marketing mix of harley davidson very strong product portfolio  personalization of product really impresses customers  high technology product which ignites passion for bikersprice in the marketing mix of harley davidsonas the company deals in mainly heavy built chassis and high displacement engines it denotes that it aims at a particular level of quality in its products and at the same time aims at a particular segment or class of customers harley davidson has always been a ultra premium priced product for the motorcycle segment and it makes no excuses for the samehowever due to this policy the company has even experienced certain setbacks and has gone through red periods in its profit curves which were overcome by means of rightsizing and layoffs still it carries its bandwagon forward with similar strategies in pricing function the effect is that harley davidson probably has the best positionings when it comes to names of premium motorcycles and a lot of this premium positioning is contributed because of the price of the motorcyclesalient points for price in the marketing mix of harley davidson  ultra premium pricing for the motorcycle segment  high price has contributed immensely to premium positioning in the minds of the customersplace in the marketing mix of harley davidsonan ideal place is where the customer is this is undoubtedly the motto of any successful business strategist and market analyst and in harley davidson it seems this motto is being widely publicized and followed due to massive exposure that it has achieved with promotions and media and with the passage of time harley davidson has got a fantastic brand equity which has resulted in extensive demands from across the globefurthermore a rise in buying potential has given the power in the hands of the customers and thus it was likely that harley davidson decided to expand globally it has been exporting bikes and spares to most parts of the world since a very long time however it affects its pricing to a greater extent due to involvement of tax structure and heavy custom duties which in turn limits this product to only the ardent fans or the growing marketsmajor strategic changes are made in production policies and two major production units are now announced outside home country namely in india for the asian market and brazil to cover distributions in latin americas which is a major “placement” advantage for harley davidson selective distribution  showrooms are found in premium locations onlypromotions in the marketing mix of harley davidsonpromotion function has always been very strategically designed and intricately executed by harley davidson which has maintained its class rather than going out and out in terms of promotion it has carried out its campaigns in a very subtle manner by sensibly lpacing harley bikes and displaying their muscle and glorifying them in movies and television seriesit has promoted rallies bike ride tours cross country marathon for harley davidson owners and introducing hog harleydavidson owner’s groups culture which has enticed new customers and promoted loyalty among current owners apart from these it has organized sale fares which promote heavy discounts in times of low sales and constantly has been carrying out lucky draws and coupons for discounts on services free services and spare parts making the promotion function innovative classy and out of the box with the complete packagebecause of the strong product portfolio harley davidson does not believe in generalizing itself and therefore advertises only in the top of the line magazines hoardings and print media vehicles the major pull for the product is created through the product and the display of the product most importantly harley davidson over the year stands for qualities such as strength friendship and enjoying the journey of life harley encourages its customers to take to the road and drive the bike to the fill of their
