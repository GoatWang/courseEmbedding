bonds overview us treasury agency municipal corporate high yield go municipal bonds municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by public entities that use the loans to fund public projects such as the construction of schools hospitals and highways open an account reasons to consider municipal bonds interest income generally federally tax exempt low level of default risk relative to other bond types find municipal bonds find bonds types features  benefits risks types in general municipal bonds fall into one of two categories—general obligation or revenue bonds this categorization is based on the source of their interest payments and principal repayments however within these categories a municipal bond can be structured in different ways with each variation offering different benefits risks and tax treatments while most investors think of municipal bonds as taxexempt investments this may not always be the case as there are instances where the income generated by a municipal bond may be taxable for example a municipality may issue a bond that does not qualify for federal tax exemption resulting in the income generated by that bond being subject to federal taxes as a result of these different treatments its important to consider all aspects of a municipal bond before making a purchase rather than relying on its broad categorization general obligation bonds gos general obligation bonds are issued by governmental entities but are not backed by revenues from a specific project such as a toll road some general obligation bonds are backed by dedicated taxes on property while others can be payable from general funds the latter types of bonds are often referred to as backed by the full faith and credit of the governmental entity while in many instances general obligation means that the issuer has unlimited authority to tax residents to pay bondholders there are cases in which the issuer or governmental entity may have limited or no taxing authority revenue bonds principal and interest payments for revenue bonds are secured by revenues generated by the issuer or by certain taxes such as sales fuel or hotel occupancy taxes the only exception is when a municipality issues bonds as a conduit issuer in those cases while the municipality is the issuing entity a third party is responsible for payments of both interest and principal to learn more about conduit issuers please see our section on conduit bonds the issuers of revenue bonds are generally nonprofit organizations c  privatesector corporations such as hospitals and universities entities that provide a public service such as utilities and public transportation authorities insured bonds some municipal bonds are insured by policies written by commercial insurance companies the insurance policy is intended to provide for the insurer to pay principal and interest payments to bondholders in the event the issuer defaults investors should take into account the creditworthiness of both the insurer and the issuer when considering insured bonds taxable municipal bonds the interest on some municipal bonds is taxable because the federal government will not subsidize the financing of activities that do not provide significant benefit to the public bonds issued to finance things like stadiums replenishment of a municipality’s underfunded pension plan or investorled housing are a few examples of issues that would not qualify for federal tax exemption build america bonds babs are a recent category of taxable municipal bonds introduced in the wake of the  financial crisis the advantage for issuers is that they receive a  federal rebate on interest costs for these bonds babs only subsidize an issuer’s borrowing cost there is no implied backing from the federal government zerocoupon bonds zerocoupon municipal bonds are issued at an original issue discount with the full value including accrued interest paid at maturity interest income may be reportable annually even though no annual payments are made market prices of zerocoupon bonds tend to be more volatile than bonds that pay interest regularly originalissue discount bonds these are municipal bonds issued at a price below face value par which qualify for special treatment under federal tax law the difference between the issue price and the face value is treated as taxexempt income rather than as capital gains if the bonds are held to maturity market discount bonds when a municipal bond is purchased for less than its face value par in the secondary market this is often referred to as a discount bonds may be sold at a discount for a variety of reasons including changes in interest rates changes in market conditions a change in the issuers credit rating or other events impacting the issuer these bonds can also be referred to as market discount bonds particularly when the amount of the discount exceeds a certain calculated amount specified under the internal revenue code prerefunded bonds prerefunded bonds result from the advance refunding of bonds that are not currently redeemable once issued the proceeds are placed in an escrow account set up to generate enough cash flow to pay interest and principal up to a specified call date the goal is typically to provide presentvalue savings to the issuer but in some cases can be used to change the indenture on the bonds the escrow account is most often funded with us treasuries although other instruments are sometimes used in which case the prerefunded bonds are considered relatively safe escrowedtomaturity etm bonds bonds are escrowed to maturity when the proceeds of a refunding issue are deposited in an escrow account for investment in an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the issue being refunded in some cases though an issuer may expressly reserve its right to exercise an early call of bonds that have been escrowed to maturity the escrow account is most often funded with us treasuries although other instruments are sometimes used in which case the escrowed bonds are considered relatively safe housing bonds housing bonds are securities backed by mortgages and mortgage loan repayments although not reflected as part of a traditional call schedule these bonds can be called at any time from the prepayment of principal on the housing authoritys underlying mortgages and therefore display as continuously callable and subject to extraordinary redemption er provisions municipal notes municipal notes are shortterm debt obligations which typically mature within a year or less but may mature within two or three years municipalities issue notes to generate stable cash flow while they wait for other expected revenues the types of municipal notes depend on the source of future cash flow such as tax anticipation notes tans revenue anticipation notes rans and bond anticipation notes bans conduit bonds these are revenue bonds issued by municipal agencies called conduit issuers that are thirdparty entities that act on behalf of the actual borrowers typically private nonprofit c entities conduit bonds may be issued for projects such as nonprofit hospitals housing developments colleges and universities transportation hubs student loan programs and public works projects the thirdparty borrower—not the issuing conduit agency—is responsible for interest payments and principal repayments the issuing agency generally is not obligated to use any other source to repay the bonds if the conduit borrower fails to make loan repayments so unless the official statements indicate otherwise investors in conduit bonds should not view the issuing governmental agency as a guarantor on conduit bonds features  benefits tax exemptions in general the interest you earn from your taxexempt municipal securities is exempt from federal income tax and in some cases state or local income tax depending on whether you are a resident of the state that issued the bond while municipal bonds coupons are often lower than those offered by similarly rated corporate bonds the fact that interest income is taxfree can result in the yields being comparable or even higher in some cases additionally if you purchase originalissue discount bonds and hold them until their maturity date those investments may receive special tax treatment under federal tax law in these cases the difference between the bond’s issue price the discounted rate and its face value would be considered taxexempt income rather than capital gains although a municipal bond may be referred to as taxexempt there could be federal and state tax consequences when you buy sell or own the bond please see our section on tax risks for more details default risk while municipal bankruptcies and defaults can and do occur they have been relatively infrequent when compared to the corporate bond market historically municipal bonds rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro and in particular general obligation bonds have experienced very low default rates for example according to a moodys study of us municipal bond defaults and recoveries  total defaults occurred over the period – including only five general obligation bond issuers at the end of  approximately  issuers were rated by moody’s in addition under federal bankruptcy laws a municipality must be specifically authorized by its state to file for protection and the rules that govern a bankruptcy differ from state to state risks interest rate risk like all fixed income securities the market prices of municipal bonds are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if interest rates rise market prices of existing bonds will typically decline despite the lack of change in both the coupon rate and maturity bonds with longer maturities are generally more susceptible to changes in interest rates than bonds with shorter maturities call risk many municipal bonds carry provisions that allow the issuer to call or redeem the bond prior to the actual maturity date an issuer will typically call bonds when prevailing interest rates drop allowing the entity to reissue bonds at a lower borrowing cost in this circumstance the action makes reinvestment less desirable for the holder some municipal bonds including housing bonds and certificates of participation cops may be callable at any time regardless of the stated call features in some cases bond issuers will call bonds to modify an indenture through a new offering investors should also be aware of special or extraordinary redemption provisions these are provisions that give a bond issuer the right to call the bonds due to a onetime occurrence such as a natural disaster interruption to a revenue source unexpended bond proceed or canceled projects liquidity risk the vast majority of municipal bonds are not traded on a regular basis therefore the market for a specific municipal bond may not be particularly liquid this can be attributed to the large number of municipal issuers and variety of securities with limited exceptions for some large more actively traded issues the chances of finding a specific municipal bond in the secondary market at any given time are relatively small according to the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb it is much more common to identify basic characteristics of a municipal bond in which an investor is interested in investing eg state creditworthiness maturity range interest rate or yield market sector etc and then to make a choice from a set of municipal securities that meet those criteria selling prior to maturity can present a challenge for municipal bond investors due to the fragmented and thinly traded nature of the market revenue sources risk with revenue bonds the interest and principal are dependent on the revenues paid by users of a facility or service or other dedicated revenues including those from special taxes in general the consumer spending that provides the funding or income stream for revenue bond issuers may be more vulnerable to changes in consumer tastes or a general economic downturn than the income stream for general obligation bond issuers essentiality is a key investor consideration for a project financed with revenue bonds for example a facility that delivers fundamental or essential services such as water and sewer may be more likely to have dependable revenues through multiple economic cycles when evaluating revenue bonds it is important to consider the overall economic health of the region or customer base and the impact it might have on the entity’s ability to sustain its revenues the exact source of the revenues that will service and repay the debt is the bond solely dependent upon one source of revenue or is a larger entity standing behind the issue the entity’s track record of operational effectiveness through multiple economic cycles is there a track record of solid growth attracting more customers or taxpayers from more diverse sources the legal provisions that may be in place to protect the bondholder such as rate covenants and debt service reserve funds the competence of financial management of the entity has its credit rating been maintained or strengthened over a period of time how has it weathered previous economic downturns how much debt does it have how much of its cash flow is committed to paying down debt vs investing in new projects or supporting services of value for the community credit and default risk credit risk is the risk that the issuer will default or be unable to make required principal or interest payments despite the fact that many municipal bonds have high credit ratings there is a risk of default in any bond investment tax risks while municipal bonds can offer attractive effective yields and can be a way to generate taxfree income they may not be right for investors in every tax bracket or for every type of account for instance a portion of the income you receive may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax even if that income is classified as tax free also once you sell a municipal bond the proceeds from that sale may be subject to capital gains or other types of taxes with capital gains taxes your earnings are taxed at either the current capital gains tax rate or your ordinary income rate depending on how long you hold the bond you may also be taxed on gains characterized as market discount at your ordinary income rate market discount arises when a bond is purchased on the secondary market for a price that is less than its stated redemption price finally its important to remember that tax laws may change so the favorable tax conditions that existed at the time you purchased a bond may be either phased out or no longer available to investors in your tax bracket please consult your tax advisor before purchasing any security inflation risk as with all bonds investors run the risk that inflation will diminish the purchasing power of a municipal bond’s principal and interest income repudiation risk there can be no assurance that bonds validly issued will not be partially or totally repudiated by the issuing state or municipality should that be deemed reasonable and necessary to serve other important public purposes other risks not all risks can be quantified in a bond’s prospectus or offering circular a type of risk called “special event risk” lawsuits or significant legal changes another community’s public works project unusual weather an economic downturn or other events could impact the issuer’s

fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up

markets as of mar   the us municipal bond market posted positive returns for the first quarter of  with the bloomberg barclays municipal bond index the index returning  for the threemonth period after experiencing a significant amount of volatility foll owing donald trump’s presidential election victory during the fourth quarter of  the municipal market stabilized during the first quarter during the period short term municipal yields declined  basis points while intermediate and longe r term yields were flat to slightly higher after experiencing significantly negative outflows during the last six weeks of  mutual fund flows stabilized and turned positive in january as some investors sought to take advantage of both higher municipal yields and attractive relative valuation s despite this expression of confidence at the beginning of the year mutual fund flows for the entire quarter were fairly tepid with overall inflows totaling just under  billion issuance during the quarter declined to  billion compared to  bi llion during the fourth quarter of  the slowdown in issuance was largely related to the a decline in refunding activity due to higher interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding president trumps agenda for health care tax reform and infrastruct ure spending compared to the sharp selloff during the fourth quarter the municipal market was relatively quiet during the first quarter treasury yields traded in a fairly tight range and the curve was more or less unchanged meanwhile the municipal yield curve st eepened significantly as two and fiveyear yields declined  and  basis points respectively while year yields increased bp as a result short term municipals outperformed longer term municipals with the five and seven year part of the curve le ading the way in terms of credit quality lower quality municipals outperformed higher quality as bbb’s within the index returned  compared to aaa’s up  similarly after underperforming significantly during the fourth quarter the bloomberg barcla ys high yield municipal bond index returned  significantly outperforming investment grade this outperformance was primarily due to higher carry spread tightening and renewed strength in the tobacco sector which returned  finally puer to rico credits underperformed significantly following the release of its certified financial plan in midmarch which proved to be more negative for all bond holders than previously anticipated performance summary  eaton vance tabs to year laddered municipal bond fund the fund underperformed its benchmark the barclays  year municipal bond index the index at net asset value for the quarter the funds credit quality positioning was the primary contributor to performance the primary detractor to performance was the funds underweight to the leasing sector the approximately equalweighted positioning between the  to year maturities was neutral to relative performance as the yield curve steepened  to year maturity bonds underperformed and  to year bonds outperformed however the index mainta ins no allocation to either of these sections of the yield curve as a result the changes in yields were offsetting and the effect to relative performance was neutral historical returns as of mar   annualized  mo  mos ytd  yr  yrs  yrs life of fund fund at nav        bloomberg barclays  year municipal bond index

the quarter credit quality differences between the fund and the index were the primary drivers of quarterly performance the funds overweight exposure to a and bbbrated bonds aided as lower quality bonds outperformed their higherquality counterparts detractors  factors detracting from the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter the funds underweight allocation to the leasing sector hurt relative performance the leasing sector was one of the bestperforming sectors in the index investment outlook and fund positioning  we believe munis continue to be attractive on both an absolute and relative level intermediate and longer term municipals stabilized during the quarter and the  and year municipaltotreasury ratios ended the quarter at  and  respectivel y lackluster mutual fund flows and the ongoing expectation of lower taxes under the trump administration have combined to keep municipal valuations attractive in our view in addition the historic move higher in yields during the fourth quarter of  c reated an emerging opportunity to lock in higher yields and potentially generate higher future returns after the first three months of  we believe this opportunity remains in place in recent history the municipal market has proven to be resilie nt and sharp increases in municipal yields have resulted in buying opportunities and rewarded investors with strong returns in subsequent months therefore we continue to believe that municipal yields could move back down a bit in  as us treasury yields are still attractive compared with other developed markets uncertainty surrounding president trump’s ability to deliver on the policy front has increased and finally the federal reserve continues to demonstrate a willingness to squeeze of f inflationary pressures if necessary given this outlook we believe taxsensitive investors continue to be offered the opportunity to scale into munis at attractive yields and valuations in addition we believe municipals will continue to act as an anchor to provide diversification in the context of an overall portfolio credit quality as of mar   aaa  aa  a  bbb  not rated  total  ratings are based

bonds overview us treasury agency municipal corporate high yield go municipal bonds municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by public entities that use the loans to fund public projects such as the construction of schools hospitals and highways open an account reasons to consider municipal bonds interest income generally federally tax exempt low level of default risk relative to other bond types find municipal bonds find bonds types features  benefits risks types in general municipal bonds fall into one of two categories—general obligation or revenue bonds this categorization is based on the source of their interest payments and principal repayments however within these categories a municipal bond can be structured in different ways with each variation offering different benefits risks and tax treatments while most investors think of municipal bonds as taxexempt investments this may not always be the case as there are instances where the income generated by a municipal bond may be taxable for example a municipality may issue a bond that does not qualify for federal tax exemption resulting in the income generated by that bond being subject to federal taxes as a result of these different treatments its important to consider all aspects of a municipal bond before making a purchase rather than relying on its broad categorization general obligation bonds gos general obligation bonds are issued by governmental entities but are not backed by revenues from a specific project such as a toll road some general obligation bonds are backed by dedicated taxes on property while others can be payable from general funds the latter types of bonds are often referred to as backed by the full faith and credit of the governmental entity while in many instances general obligation means that the issuer has unlimited authority to tax residents to pay bondholders there are cases in which the issuer or governmental entity may have limited or no taxing authority revenue bonds principal and interest payments for revenue bonds are secured by revenues generated by the issuer or by certain taxes such as sales fuel or hotel occupancy taxes the only exception is when a municipality issues bonds as a conduit issuer in those cases while the municipality is the issuing entity a third party is responsible for payments of both interest and principal to learn more about conduit issuers please see our section on conduit bonds the issuers of revenue bonds are generally nonprofit organizations c  privatesector corporations such as hospitals and universities entities that provide a public service such as utilities and public transportation authorities insured bonds some municipal bonds are insured by policies written by commercial insurance companies the insurance policy is intended to provide for the insurer to pay principal and interest payments to bondholders in the event the issuer defaults investors should take into account the creditworthiness of both the insurer and the issuer when considering insured bonds taxable municipal bonds the interest on some municipal bonds is taxable because the federal government will not subsidize the financing of activities that do not provide significant benefit to the public bonds issued to finance things like stadiums replenishment of a municipality’s underfunded pension plan or investorled housing are a few examples of issues that would not qualify for federal tax exemption build america bonds babs are a recent category of taxable municipal bonds introduced in the wake of the  financial crisis the advantage for issuers is that they receive a  federal rebate on interest costs for these bonds babs only subsidize an issuer’s borrowing cost there is no implied backing from the federal government zerocoupon bonds zerocoupon municipal bonds are issued at an original issue discount with the full value including accrued interest paid at maturity interest income may be reportable annually even though no annual payments are made market prices of zerocoupon bonds tend to be more volatile than bonds that pay interest regularly originalissue discount bonds these are municipal bonds issued at a price below face value par which qualify for special treatment under federal tax law the difference between the issue price and the face value is treated as taxexempt income rather than as capital gains if the bonds are held to maturity market discount bonds when a municipal bond is purchased for less than its face value par in the secondary market this is often referred to as a discount bonds may be sold at a discount for a variety of reasons including changes in interest rates changes in market conditions a change in the issuers credit rating or other events impacting the issuer these bonds can also be referred to as market discount bonds particularly when the amount of the discount exceeds a certain calculated amount specified under the internal revenue code prerefunded bonds prerefunded bonds result from the advance refunding of bonds that are not currently redeemable once issued the proceeds are placed in an escrow account set up to generate enough cash flow to pay interest and principal up to a specified call date the goal is typically to provide presentvalue savings to the issuer but in some cases can be used to change the indenture on the bonds the escrow account is most often funded with us treasuries although other instruments are sometimes used in which case the prerefunded bonds are considered relatively safe escrowedtomaturity etm bonds bonds are escrowed to maturity when the proceeds of a refunding issue are deposited in an escrow account for investment in an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the issue being refunded in some cases though an issuer may expressly reserve its right to exercise an early call of bonds that have been escrowed to maturity the escrow account is most often funded with us treasuries although other instruments are sometimes used in which case the escrowed bonds are considered relatively safe housing bonds housing bonds are securities backed by mortgages and mortgage loan repayments although not reflected as part of a traditional call schedule these bonds can be called at any time from the prepayment of principal on the housing authoritys underlying mortgages and therefore display as continuously callable and subject to extraordinary redemption er provisions municipal notes municipal notes are shortterm debt obligations which typically mature within a year or less but may mature within two or three years municipalities issue notes to generate stable cash flow while they wait for other expected revenues the types of municipal notes depend on the source of future cash flow such as tax anticipation notes tans revenue anticipation notes rans and bond anticipation notes bans conduit bonds these are revenue bonds issued by municipal agencies called conduit issuers that are thirdparty entities that act on behalf of the actual borrowers typically private nonprofit c entities conduit bonds may be issued for projects such as nonprofit hospitals housing developments colleges and universities transportation hubs student loan programs and public works projects the thirdparty borrower—not the issuing conduit agency—is responsible for interest payments and principal repayments the issuing agency generally is not obligated to use any other source to repay the bonds if the conduit borrower fails to make loan repayments so unless the official statements indicate otherwise investors in conduit bonds should not view the issuing governmental agency as a guarantor on conduit bonds features  benefits tax exemptions in general the interest you earn from your taxexempt municipal securities is exempt from federal income tax and in some cases state or local income tax depending on whether you are a resident of the state that issued the bond while municipal bonds coupons are often lower than those offered by similarly rated corporate bonds the fact that interest income is taxfree can result in the yields being comparable or even higher in some cases additionally if you purchase originalissue discount bonds and hold them until their maturity date those investments may receive special tax treatment under federal tax law in these cases the difference between the bond’s issue price the discounted rate and its face value would be considered taxexempt income rather than capital gains although a municipal bond may be referred to as taxexempt there could be federal and state tax consequences when you buy sell or own the bond please see our section on tax risks for more details default risk while municipal bankruptcies and defaults can and do occur they have been relatively infrequent when compared to the corporate bond market historically municipal bonds rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro and in particular general obligation bonds have experienced very low default rates for example according to a moodys study of us municipal bond defaults and recoveries  total defaults occurred over the period – including only five general obligation bond issuers at the end of  approximately  issuers were rated by moody’s in addition under federal bankruptcy laws a municipality must be specifically authorized by its state to file for protection and the rules that govern a bankruptcy differ from state to state risks interest rate risk like all fixed income securities the market prices of municipal bonds are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if interest rates rise market prices of existing bonds will typically decline despite the lack of change in both the coupon rate and maturity bonds with longer maturities are generally more susceptible to changes in interest rates than bonds with shorter maturities call risk many municipal bonds carry provisions that allow the issuer to call or redeem the bond prior to the actual maturity date an issuer will typically call bonds when prevailing interest rates drop allowing the entity to reissue bonds at a lower borrowing cost in this circumstance the action makes reinvestment less desirable for the holder some municipal bonds including housing bonds and certificates of participation cops may be callable at any time regardless of the stated call features in some cases bond issuers will call bonds to modify an indenture through a new offering investors should also be aware of special or extraordinary redemption provisions these are provisions that give a bond issuer the right to call the bonds due to a onetime occurrence such as a natural disaster interruption to a revenue source unexpended bond proceed or canceled projects liquidity risk the vast majority of municipal bonds are not traded on a regular basis therefore the market for a specific municipal bond may not be particularly liquid this can be attributed to the large number of municipal issuers and variety of securities with limited exceptions for some large more actively traded issues the chances of finding a specific municipal bond in the secondary market at any given time are relatively small according to the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb it is much more common to identify basic characteristics of a municipal bond in which an investor is interested in investing eg state creditworthiness maturity range interest rate or yield market sector etc and then to make a choice from a set of municipal securities that meet those criteria selling prior to maturity can present a challenge for municipal bond investors due to the fragmented and thinly traded nature of the market revenue sources risk with revenue bonds the interest and principal are dependent on the revenues paid by users of a facility or service or other dedicated revenues including those from special taxes in general the consumer spending that provides the funding or income stream for revenue bond issuers may be more vulnerable to changes in consumer tastes or a general economic downturn than the income stream for general obligation bond issuers essentiality is a key investor consideration for a project financed with revenue bonds for example a facility that delivers fundamental or essential services such as water and sewer may be more likely to have dependable revenues through multiple economic cycles when evaluating revenue bonds it is important to consider the overall economic health of the region or customer base and the impact it might have on the entity’s ability to sustain its revenues the exact source of the revenues that will service and repay the debt is the bond solely dependent upon one source of revenue or is a larger entity standing behind the issue the entity’s track record of operational effectiveness through multiple economic cycles is there a track record of solid growth attracting more customers or taxpayers from more diverse sources the legal provisions that may be in place to protect the bondholder such as rate covenants and debt service reserve funds the competence of financial management of the entity has its credit rating been maintained or strengthened over a period of time how has it weathered previous economic downturns how much debt does it have how much of its cash flow is committed to paying down debt vs investing in new projects or supporting services of value for the community credit and default risk credit risk is the risk that the issuer will default or be unable to make required principal or interest payments despite the fact that many municipal bonds have high credit ratings there is a risk of default in any bond investment tax risks while municipal bonds can offer attractive effective yields and can be a way to generate taxfree income they may not be right for investors in every tax bracket or for every type of account for instance a portion of the income you receive may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax even if that income is classified as tax free also once you sell a municipal bond the proceeds from that sale may be subject to capital gains or other types of taxes with capital gains taxes your earnings are taxed at either the current capital gains tax rate or your ordinary income rate depending on how long you hold the bond you may also be taxed on gains characterized as market discount at your ordinary income rate market discount arises when a bond is purchased on the secondary market for a price that is less than its stated redemption price finally its important to remember that tax laws may change so the favorable tax conditions that existed at the time you purchased a bond may be either phased out or no longer available to investors in your tax bracket please consult your tax advisor before purchasing any security inflation risk as with all bonds investors run the risk that inflation will diminish the purchasing power of a municipal bond’s principal and interest income repudiation risk there can be no assurance that bonds validly issued will not be partially or totally repudiated by the issuing state or municipality should that be deemed reasonable and necessary to serve other important public purposes other risks not all risks can be quantified in a bond’s prospectus or offering circular a type of risk called “special event risk” lawsuits or significant legal changes another community’s public works project unusual weather an economic downturn or other events could impact the issuer’s

fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up
