an update on the el morro project where the company is a  percent partner with goldcorp inc “goldcorp” the project developer and operator holding the remaining  percent el morro is an advanced stage worldclass coppergold project in northern chile one of the most attractive mining jurisdictions in the world new gold has been informed that goldcorp’s board of directors has officially approved the decision to commence with construction of the el morro project with the start of construction targeted for the end of the chilean winter season in september  in total the development of el morro is expected to take five years at a capital cost of  billion  basis under the terms of new gold’s agreement with goldcorp goldcorp is responsible for funding new gold’s  share of capital costs or approximately  billion the carried funding will accrue interest at a fixed rate of  new gold will repay its share of capital plus accumulated interest out of  of its  share of the project’s cash flow with new gold retaining  of its  share of cash flow from the time production commences “our  percent interest in el morro positions us very well as we have a meaningful share of this great project with a proven mine developer and operator as a partner and a favourable financing arrangement that carries us through production” stated randall oliphant executive chairman initial production from the mine is expected in  with full production anticipated in  development activities during  will focus on access road construction engineering equipment procurement and exploration drilling will be a combination of additional condemnation drilling for infrastructure locations and exploration drilling to test potential extensions of the la fortuna deposit la fortuna which hosts the current mineral resource is one of the two principal zones of goldcopper mineralization that have been identified to date the el morro zone and several additional targets have also been identified which could become

includes  billion pounds copper and  million ounces gold new gold has recently received the data and analysis supporting goldcorp’s update of the project’s  feasibility study and has engaged roscoe postle associates inc to complete a detailed review of the results on new gold’s behalf the results of goldcorp’s updated study indicate that new gold’s  percent share of annual production is expected to be over  ounces of gold and  million pounds of copper over an initial year mine life lifeofmine cash costs are expected to be approximately  per ounce of gold on a byproduct basis and approximately  per ounce of gold and  per pound of copper on a coproduct basis metals price assumptions used to calculate the average lifeofmine el morro cash costs are  per ounce of gold and  per pound of copper             the el morro project currently contemplates the mining and milling of sulphide copper and gold ore from the la fortuna mineral deposit through a  tonneperday concentrator   the plant design includes a crushing plant semiautogenous grinding sag circuit rougher flotation and regrind circuit and cleaner and scavenger flotation banks additional projectrelated infrastructure includes a desalination plant power plant and concentrate filtration plant the construction of a new access route from the project to the pan american highway is also contemplated with the route serving as the concentrate and water pipeline route and the preferred location for the project power line water supply is planned to be sourced from a reverseosmosis desalination plant that will produce  litres per

results gold production the fourth quarter provided the company with its highest quarterly production of the year which led to fullyear production meeting the companys guidance range of  to  ounces production during the quarter of  ounces remained consistent with the prioryear quarter as scheduled increases in production at mesquite and cerro san pedro were offset by a decrease in production at the peak mines due to unscheduled mill downtime for the full year increased production at new afton was offset by an expected decrease in production at cerro san pedro resulting in lower consolidated production relative to  new afton gold production at new afton during the fourth quarter of  ounces remained consistent with the prioryear quarter as a  increase in tonnes processed offset a slight decrease in gold grade and lower recovery from the combination of the higher throughput and lower grade  fullyear gold production of  ounces increased by  relative to  the increase in production was driven by the combination of a  increase in throughput and a  increase in grade which was only partially offset by an expected  decrease in recovery stemming from the higher throughput new aftons fullyear gold production was in the middle of its guidance range of  to  ounces mesquite mesquite delivered its highest quarterly production of  in the fourth quarter production during the quarter of

at new afton of  million pounds increased by  as a result of higher tonnes processed and exceeded its guidance range of  to  million pounds at the same time production at the peak mines of  million

consolidated fourth quarter silver production remained consistent with the prioryear quarter cerro san pedros  fullyear silver production of  million ounces met the low end of its guidance range and was slightly below that of the prior year due to a combination of lower ore tonnes placed and lower grade the small silver contributions from new afton and the peak mines were both in line with

continued steady performance from the peak mines as the mine moves through  into  the current mine plan estimates that an increasing percentage of ore could be sourced from the copperrich ore bodies

pedros final year of active mining is scheduled to deliver an approximate  increase in gold production coupled with an even greater increase in silver production the increase in production of both metals is driven by a combination of an expected  increase in ore tonnes placed on the leach pad and higher gold and silver grades for gold these benefits are partially offset by the planned processing of ore with lower expected recoveries allin sustaining costs  of  to  per ounce as well as total cash costs   are expected to be well below those of  the decrease in total cash costs  is

six months new gold now plans to construct rainy river over a month period instead of the month period contemplated in the january  feasibility study resulting in commissioning being targeted in mid in addition to permitting one of the primary areas of focus in  was the advancement of detailed engineering as of the end of january  detailed engineering was  complete through the detailed

river over the last year stated robert gallagher president and chief executive officer by working closely with our first nations and métis partners as well as other local stakeholders we recently achieved a significant milestone with the federal and provincial governments approval of the projects environmental assessment with rainy river now almost fully engineered we look forward to moving forward and executing on a successful development as we did most recently with new afton overall the rainy river project enhances new golds growth pipeline through its manageable capital costs significant production scale at below current industry average costs and exciting regional exploration potential in a great mining jurisdiction the company looks forward to advancing the rainy river project and providing further updates on its development through the remainder of  and beyond blackwater the companys blackwater project is located in southcentral british columbia once in production blackwater is expected to produce an average of  ounces of gold per year at below industry average costs consistent with rainy river the depreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar benefits both blackwaters development and operating costs as well as the projects economics in the current commodity price environment new gold plans to sequence the development of its projects with the nearterm focus being on the advancement of the lower capital cost rainy river project thereafter the timing of blackwaters development will be driven by prevailing market conditions over the coming years capital expenditures during  were  million which primarily related to the continued advancement of the environmental assessment process and related environmental and engineering studies

a constant gold and copper price the aftertax npv and irr changes by approximately  million the scoping study relates to the economic potential of the czone mineral resources at the new afton property and is not part of and should be distinguished from the current mining of the bzone reserves mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the reader is cautioned that a scoping study is preliminary in nature and accordingly subject to a high degree of uncertainty a preliminary andor definitive feasibility study will be required to further evaluate the czone projects economics the scoping study was prepared by new gold with roscoe postle associates inc rpa providing an independent third party review the independent qualified persons who reviewed and approved the disclosure contained on the czone scoping study included in this news release were david w rennie peng principal geologist rpa holger krutzellmann peng  associate principal metallurgist rpa and r dennis bergen peng associate principal mining engineer rpa based on the results of the scoping study new gold is targeting the completion of a feasibility study in the first quarter of  subject to the completion of a positive feasibility study a development decision by the company and receipt of the requisite permits development of the czone could begin in  with the main access ramps being completed by the end of  thereafter development of the block cave production levels would begin the czone extraction level would be approximately  metres below the current bzone extraction level based on this development schedule production could begin in early  with an month ramp up to full production in mid one of the opportunities that the company will pursue as the access ramps are developed is to further drill test the czone to expand and upgrade the resource classification of the minable tonnage the deposit remains open at depth and to the west operationally the same development production and materials handling strategies would be used for the czone as are currently being used to mine the new afton bzone reserve the majority of the mobile mining equipment would be taken from the current operation with estimated refurbishment and replacement requirements factored into the capital cost estimate a first phase metallurgical program that was designed to assess the amenability of the czone ore to be processed via the current mill flowsheet was successful the mill recoveries are expected to be similar to those achieved since the start of commercial production at new afton in mid after assessing various tailings storage options for the czone it was concluded that the optimal approach would likely involve the expansion of the current new afton tailings storage facility beyond the tailings storage plan one of the key focuses of the scoping study was to begin to assess the impact that the surface subsidence from the czone underground mine could have on surface infrastructure detailed modelling was completed to estimate the area of subsidence and it was determined that a portion of the tailings dam from the historic afton mine is located within the predicted area of subsidence to mitigate the potential risk associated with the historic tailings it is anticipated that the tailings would be stabilized within the existing facility through a dewatering and consolidation program new gold holds an option to acquire the land on which the historic tailings are located as the company moves towards the completion of a feasibility study additional studies and testwork will be completed on the tailings stabilization plan it is expected that the permits for the czone project will involve amendments to current permits rather than applications for new permits the project plan should not result in significant additional surface disturbance or environmental impact in addition the project would not require additional annual water consumption as the mill throughput is not scheduled to change the currently contemplated closure plan for new afton would remain in place for the czone project with an amendment made to incorporate the historic tailings the incremental costs associated with any amendments to the closure plan have been included in the project economics in  the company has planned capital expenditures of  million to further advance the czone project toward a feasibility study work during the year will include additional subsidence modeling completion of a tailings stabilization test program as well as other supporting studies new gold looks forward to providing updates on the continued progress of the czone project the key parameters and assumptions associated with the czone scoping study do not impact the current new afton mining operation or the new afton bzone mineral reserves the scoping study discussed above is based on measured indicated and inferred resources and is preliminary in nature accordingly the scoping study is subject to a high degree of uncertainty the scoping study includes mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty the scoping study will be realized el morro new golds share of the el morro project provides the

mineral reserve and resource statements at the end of this news release for further detail      yearend mineral reserves and resources as part of new golds estimate of  yearend mineral reserves and resources the company lowered the prices used to estimate mineral reserves by  per ounce to  per ounce of gold for all of its assets with the exception of el morro and by  per ounce to  per ounce of silver the reserve pricing assumption for copper was held at  per pound new gold has also revised its approach to the reporting of measured and indicated resources measured and indicated resources are now reported exclusive of mineral reserves and new gold intends to present mineral resources on that basis going forward for general comparison purposes only the  yearend measured and indicated resources which are exclusive of reserves were calculated by subtracting the contained metal for  yearend mineral reserves from the  yearend measured and indicated resources inclusive of reserves on a consolidated basis the  million ounce or  decrease in gold mineral reserves to  million ounces is primarily attributable to depletion of over  million ounces resulting from  mining activity at the companys four operating mines the balance of  million ounces is a result of the combination of the lower reserve price assumptions and resulting changes to mineral resource block model estimates and updated mine plans the majority of the change in copper mineral reserves was also driven by depletion the change in consolidated measured and indicated gold resources exclusive of reserves was primarily attributable to a reduction of mesquites mineral resource inventory which mostly consisted of transitional and sulphide material the  yearend proven and probable mineral reserves for new golds three projects remained unchanged at  million ounces of gold  billion pounds of copper and  million ounces of silver in addition early in  the company completed the acquisition of bayfield which will add to the companys gold and silver mineral resource inventory at rainy river at new afton beyond  mine depletion approximately two million tonnes of marginal low grade material were removed from the reserve as a result of mine plan optimization new aftons measured and indicated mineral resources increased during  driven by a more than  increase in the czone resource contained gold and copper the  million ounce change in mesquites  yearend mineral reserves was driven by  million ounces of mine depletion with the balance due to the combination of lower reserve pricing the results of infill drilling to improve resource confidence and reduced slope angles for certain pit walls at cerro san pedro the majority of the  million ounce decline in reserves was due to mine depletion with the remaining amount driven by the removal of approximately four million tonnes of low grade material from the mine plan at the peak mines the company was once again successful in replacing a significant portion of the material that was mined in  production at the peak mines in  was  ounces of gold and  million pounds of copper and through its exploration efforts the companys  yearend gold and copper mineral reserves decreased by less than  relative to the end of   exploration plans new golds  exploration program will primarily be focused on three assets rainy river the peak mines and blackwater with scheduled exploration spending totaling up to  million of which  million is expected to be expensed at rainy river one of the successes of the companys  exploration efforts was the identification of a new prospective volcanic massive sulphide vms horizon to the south of the odm and intrepid zones in  new gold plans to continue exploring this prospective horizon as well as other discrete highgrade vmsstyle targets within the greater rainy river property position consistent with prior years the objective at the peak mines in  is to further the mines history of mineral reserve and resource replacement a total of  metres of underground exploration is planned with an additional  metres of surface exploration drilling scheduled the surface exploration will test targets both along the mine corridor as well as priority regional prospects at blackwater the primary focus will be on following up on the porphyry and epithermalstyle mineralization that was identified in the area immediately to the south of the main blackwater deposit in  additional surface mapping and geophysical targeting work is planned to further test this area depending on the results of this targeting it

measures  allin sustaining costs consistent with guidance announced in  by the world gold council an association of various gold mining companies from around the world of which new gold is a member new gold defines allin sustaining costs per ounce as the sum of total cash costs capital expenditures that are sustaining in nature corporate general and administrative costs capitalized and expensed exploration that is sustaining in nature and environmental reclamation costs all divided by the ounces of gold sold to arrive at a per ounce figure new gold believes this nongaap financial measure provides further transparency into costs associated with producing gold and will assist analysts investors and other stakeholders of the company in assessing the companys operating performance its ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall value this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a nongaap financial measure allin sustaining costs presented do not have a standardized meaning under ifrs and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining companies it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under ifrs or operating costs presented under ifrs further details regarding historical allin sustaining costs and a reconciliation to the nearest ifrs measures are provided in the mda accompanying new golds financial statements filed from time to time on wwwsedarcom  total cash costs total cash costs per ounce figures are nongaap measures which are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the gold institute a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products that ceased operations in  adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies new gold reports total cash costs on a sales basis the company believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the companys performance and ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future capital expenditures and working capital needs  this measure along with sales is considered to be a key indicator of the companys ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing and administration costs royalties production taxes and realized gains and losses on fuel contracts but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital and exploration costs and net of byproduct sales total cash costs are then divided by ounces of gold sold to arrive at a per ounce figure coproduct cash costs remove the impact of other metal sales that are produced as a byproduct of gold production and apportion the cash costs to each metal produced on a percentage of revenue basis and subsequently divides the amount by the total ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper sold as the case may be to arrive at per ounce or per pound figures unless otherwise indicated all total cash cost information in this news release is net of byproduct sales this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a nongaap financial measure total cash costs and coproduct

wwwsedarcom  average realized price average realized price per ounce or pound sold is a nongaap financial measure with no standard meaning under ifrs management uses this measure to better understand the price realized in each reporting period for gold silver and copper sales average realized price includes realized gains and losses from gold hedge settlements up until may   but excludes from revenues unrealized gains and losses on nonhedged derivative contracts and the revenue reduction related to the noncash accounting charge as the loss incurred on the monetization of the companys legacy hedge position is realized into income over the original term of the hedge contract average realized price is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized definition under ifrs it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs other companies may calculate this measure differently

investing in gold home info faq videos its time to invest in gold we make the case for gold our goal is to make the average person aware of gold and how to invest in it below you will find reasons to invest in gold answers to popular questions selected videos and our recommended gold related companies have a question or suggestion feel free to email us anytime reasons to invest in gold  all paper currencies fail sooner or later  central banks  billionaires have been investing in gold  gold does well in both inflation  deflation  gold does well in times of complete economic collapse  gold has withstood the test of time by being used for thousands of years  people flock to gold in times of geopolitical uncertainty eg brexit  there is a limited supply of gold which cannot be increased like paper money can  supply of gold is falling due to falling mining production and is projected to continue falling  new gold discoveries have been falling and are projected to continue falling  gold is durable unlike paper money which can be ripped or burned  gold is extremely portable a whole suitcase of money would be needed to buy what a little piece of gold can  gold is a great way to diversify a portfolio  physical gold cannot be hacked  gold is not subject to capital control restrictions eg greece cyprus faq why should i invest in gold there are many reasons but there are  very important reasons why  all paper currencies always fail there has never been a paper currency that has never failed to the contrary gold has never failed and has been a consistent store of value throughout history  countries and governments are buying gold like crazy  billionaires are buying gold there is a reason billionaires are billionaires and that is because they know how to invest they are investing for their future with gold are there any other ways to invest in gold other than owning physical gold yes you could invest in exploration or mining companies these companies do the hard work of exploring for gold and producing gold they actually own physical gold  silver in the ground so their share prices are directly correlated to the spot prices of gold  silver here are the stock ticker symbols which us investors may want to consider northern dynasty minerals nak  highly recommended  first mining finance corp ffmgf first majestic silver corp ag callinex mines inc cllxf brazil minerals inc bmix gold lakes corp gllk how easy will it be to sell my physical gold very easy gold is very liquid that is it is very easy to sell gold to a buyer below are some of the places someone will be able to sell their physical gold at most reputable bullion dealers offer buy back programs in other words they will buy back whatever they have sold you you would simply deliver the gold to them either in person or through insured mail and they would pay you near spot price for your gold local pawn shops local classified ads eg craigslist local auctions local precious metals dealers  coin collecting shops online auctions eg ebay ebid depending on your location even some banks may buy your gold from you near spot price how can i safely store my physical gold there are a few ways investors can do this gold depository  this is the most recommended method some examples are delaware depository and transcontinental depository services you could even get an overseas vault of your choice if buying your gold online through bullionvault their vaults are audited daily are anonymous have low fees and come with free insurance home safe  a dual combinationkey safe is recommended most electronic safes can be hacked too easily and most combination safes can be opened by a professional quickly too you want a heavy one it would make little sense to have a light safe which someone could just run off with quickly also it would make little sense to have a cheap safe that someone could crack open with a crow bar so a sturdy heavy dual combinationkey safe is recommended you could even bolt it to the wall or floor for extra security or better yet have it hidden inside your home somewhere the idea is to make it as difficult as possible for a potential thief to take your gold local storage rental  you could keep your gold inside a safe located inside your own storage unit at a local storage company as long as you pay the fees and purchase renters insurance all should go well make sure they are a registered company have  security cameras and have restricted access eg fully fenced locked doors this method has  layers of protection a potential thief would first need to get into the storage facility then they would need to get into your unit which would be locked then they would need to get inside your safe which would be inside your unit so a potential thief would have  layers of protection to get through until they get to your gold bank safety deposit box  these are secure and cheap they typically cost around  per year disclosure requirements of contents is typically minimal or none you could visit your bank during the week to check on your gold too it is recommended you diversify your gold into multiple locations for example you could keep  of your gold in a depository or vault and the other  can be split up between a home safe and a local storage unit if you ever heard the saying dont put all your eggs in one basket this is exactly the time to apply this advice should i invest in a gold etf instead of physical gold there are certainly some advantages of investing in a gold etf for example they can be invested in just as easily as stocks can also with an etf there is no physical gold that needs stored however investing in real physical gold instead of an etf is recommended here is why  anything electronic can be hacked banks and companies get hacked on a daily basis nowadays with enough experience and enough time a hacker could possibly change or remove your ownership of the etf real gold in your possession cannot be hacked  during a major financial calamity the stock exchanges can be suspended this has happened in history if this were to happen you would not be able to do anything with your etf investment however if you owned real physical gold you would be able to do whatever you want with your gold  your privacy is compromised any etf must be traded through a registered brokerdealer who is required by law to know everything about you they are required to report all trades to the government also which includes any profit you have made buying real gold whether it be allocated gold held in a depository through bullionvault or a bullion dealer such as provident metals is more anonymous they are not required to report anything to the government unless certain rare circumstances are met  not all etfs are even backed by

withstood the test of time by being used for thousands of years  people flock to gold in times of geopolitical uncertainty eg brexit  there is a limited supply of gold which cannot be increased like paper money can  supply of gold is falling due to falling mining production and is projected to continue falling  new gold discoveries have been falling and are projected to continue falling  gold is durable unlike paper money which can be ripped or burned  gold is extremely portable a whole suitcase of money would be needed to buy what a little piece of gold can  gold is a great way to diversify

ticker symbols which us investors may want to consider northern dynasty minerals nak  highly recommended  first mining finance corp ffmgf first majestic silver corp ag callinex mines inc cllxf brazil minerals inc bmix gold lakes corp gllk how easy will it be to sell my physical gold very easy gold is very liquid that is it is very easy to sell gold to a buyer below are some of the places someone will be able to sell their physical gold at most reputable bullion dealers offer buy back programs in other words they will buy back whatever they have sold you you would simply deliver the gold to them either in person or through insured mail and they would pay you near spot price for your gold local pawn shops local classified ads eg craigslist local auctions local precious metals dealers  coin collecting shops online auctions eg ebay ebid depending on your location even some banks may buy your gold from you near spot price how can i safely store my physical gold there are a few ways investors can do this gold depository  this is the most recommended method some examples are delaware depository and transcontinental depository services you could even get an overseas vault of your choice if buying your gold online through bullionvault their vaults are audited daily are anonymous have low fees and come with free insurance home safe  a dual combinationkey safe is recommended most electronic safes can be hacked too easily and most combination safes can be opened by a professional quickly too you want a heavy one it would make little sense to have a light safe which someone could just run off with quickly also it would make little sense to have a cheap safe that someone could crack open with a crow bar so a sturdy heavy dual combinationkey safe is recommended you could even bolt it to the wall or floor for extra security or better yet have it hidden inside your home somewhere the idea is to make it as difficult as possible for a potential thief to take your gold local storage rental  you could keep your gold inside a safe located inside your own storage unit at a local storage company as long as you pay the fees and purchase renters insurance all should go well make sure they are a registered company have  security cameras and have restricted access eg fully fenced locked doors this method has  layers of protection a potential thief would first need to get into the storage facility then they would need to get into your unit which would be locked then they would need to get inside your safe which would be inside your unit so a potential thief would have  layers of protection to get through until they get to your gold bank safety deposit box  these are secure and cheap they typically cost around  per year disclosure requirements of contents is typically minimal or none you could visit your bank during the week to check on your gold too it is recommended you diversify your gold into multiple locations for example you could keep  of your gold in a depository or vault and the other  can be split up between a home safe and a local storage unit if you ever heard the saying dont put all your eggs in one basket this is exactly the time to apply this advice should i invest in a gold etf instead of physical gold there are certainly some advantages of investing in a gold etf for example they can be invested in just as easily as stocks can also with an etf there is no physical gold that needs stored however investing in real physical gold instead of an etf is recommended here is why  anything electronic can be hacked banks and companies get hacked on a daily basis nowadays with enough experience and enough time a hacker could possibly change or remove your ownership of the etf real gold in your possession cannot be hacked  during a major financial calamity the stock exchanges can be suspended this has happened in history if this were to happen you would not be able to do anything with your etf investment however if you owned real physical gold you would be able to do whatever you want with your gold  your privacy is compromised any etf must be traded through a registered brokerdealer who is required by law to know everything about you they are required to report all trades to the government also which includes any profit you have made buying real gold whether it be allocated gold held in a depository through bullionvault

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors

capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase
