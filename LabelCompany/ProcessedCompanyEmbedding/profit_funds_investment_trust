gift shop in historic biltmore village end up an option guru  let’s see… in  a freak flood destroyed the retail business wendy and her husband had poured every bit of their time and money into for more than  years since they had no flood insurance they lost everything… and were in real trouble fortunately a friend introduced wendy to options trading desperate to save her family from financial ruin wendy started reading books watching financial news and taking courses… struggling with the same sort of ups and downs as most new traders then one day she stumbled upon a miraculous discovery  by combining two common indicators into one she created a hybrid indicator that’s nearly  infallible practically overnight wendy was making more money trading than she and jack had ever made in their store inspired to help other women enjoy the financial security she had found wendy started giving oniine classes and in  she coauthored a book entitled “option trading in your spare time—a guide to financial independence for women” “i feel i was given a second chance” wendy said “so i felt i owed it to society to give back and help others  and go make a difference” and that’s exactly what she’s done… in spades get this undeterred by the title and pretty pink cover of her first book even more men than women ended up buying it   and that led to  more books trading courses newsletters and advisory services written about in money magazine small business opportunities magazine and investor’s business daily… wendy is quoted as saying   “i love that my books have helped so many people achieve financial independence through trading just like i had” grandma’s simple secret for extra income is wendy’s gift to you enjoy   option and stock investing involves risk and is not suitable for
