rent your ideas to fortune  companies plus video  comments share thisfacebooktwitteremailreddit written by tim ferriss topics filling the void gadgets the book  hww i first met stephen key in  two months later i used a few recommendations of his — shared over the customary gin tonic — to help a friend double overseas sales in less than two weeks in new zealand and australia how licensing it can be a beautifully elegant model stephen is somewhat famous in inventing circles for two reasons first he consistently earns millions of dollars licensing his ideas to companies like disney nestle and cocacola second he is fast it seldom takes him more than three weeks to go from idea to a signed deal he is not hightech there are no multiyear product development cycles he specializes is creating simple products or improving upon existing products often using nothing more than a singlesided drawing or photograph coupled with refined coldcalling skills stephen meets with some of the most influential marketing executives in the world in this interview we’ll explore how this advisor to american inventor rents his ideas to fortune  companies  what exactly is licensing and why is it a good option for people with ideas but little time or patience i think licensing is a bit of mystery to many people it really doesn’t have to be licensing is renting your idea to a manufacturer the manufacturer handles the marketing manufacturing distribution and basically everything else required to bring the product to market usually quarterly four times a year the manufacturer pays you a royalty on every unit they sell this royalty—generally a percentage of the total wholesale price—is your payment for bringing them a new product idea that they can sell to their customers it’s an attractive lowrisk alternative to manufacturing products and taking them to market yourself using licensing i can spend my time coming up with new product ideas instead of worrying about balance sheets cash flow employees and all the other hassles of running a company i might pitch three ideas one month and no ideas for the next two months you can have total flexibility with your work schedule here’s one tip on how to make sure you get paid a certain amount four times a year minimum guarantees – so here’s why i use the term “renting” when describing licensing your idea to a manufacturer it’s very important to make sure the manufacturer performs you need a performance clause in the licensing contract without a performance clause the manufacturer could just sit on the idea and do nothing with it i’ve seen it happen ensure you have a “minimum guarantee” clause in the contract a minimum guarantee clause basically says the manufacturer needs to perform and sell a specified number of units every quarter or every year otherwise you get your idea back and you can license your idea to another manufacturer it isn’t usually necessary to call in enforce the minimum guarantee clause most of the time you want to give the manufacturer a chance to perform after all you are partnering with them and they’ve spent big money on setting up their facilities to manufacture your new product here’s another tip don’t front load the deal i see many people with ideas doing this they ask for large up front fees and make it to hard for the manufacturer to say yes to the deal instead ask only a small amount of money up front and scale up the minimum guarantees each quarter an example of minimum guarantees  units quarter one  units quarter two  units quarter three let’s say the manufacturer sells  units quarter one you would get paid a royalty on each of the  units sold then let’s say the manufacturer only sells  units quarter two the manufacturer can choose to pay you the royalty for the minimum  units they guaranteed you they would sell and they would retain the rights to manufacture your idea you should be ok with these “minimum guarantee” numbers since you set them up when you negotiated the contract set up numbers you think the manufacture can meet and that you’ll be ok with if the manufacture just meets the agreed upon “minimum guarantee” of course you would prefer to earn royalties on  units every quarter but you know you are guaranteed at least a certain “minimum guarantee” every quarter this makes it nice when budgeting to buy that new sports car you’ve had your eye on  i’ve heard you say that the most important thing you can do when licensing an idea is to spend as little time and money on the project before you get feedback from a manufacturer why yes that’s true unfortunately it’s the exact opposite of what most people do most people go out and spend k to k or more on a patent and a few grand or more on a prototype first time is the enemy in this process i’ve talked to inventors who have been contemplating or working on ideas for years that’s not me when i have an idea it only takes me three days to three weeks to find out if the idea has legs on average i recommend that my students take no longer than three weeks to three months before they make the decision to keep working on the project or dump the idea and move onto the next one spend very little time or money on a project before you get feedback from manufacturers the reason for this is simple you’re not going to hit every idea out of the ballpark sometimes the benefits of the idea just aren’t intriguing enough maybe the idea has some manufacturing problems maybe the idea has been tried before and you didn’t find it with your research there can be many reasons why manufacturers decide not to move forward with an idea you need to call a handful of potential manufacturers that might sell your idea it takes very little time and next to no money to make the calls and it’s the only way you’ll get the critical earlystage feedback file a provisional patent application  create your sell sheet  and start making phone calls as soon as possible that’s totally the opposite of what most people do most people dream or plan and research the idea to death the reality is that you will never be as knowledgeable about a particular industry as a manufacturer that been in the business for thirty years they’ve seen everything imaginable in their product area their opinion is the only one that matters get your idea in front of them as soon as possible and get the feedback you need to pursue it or kill it here’s a summary of my solution to the patent and prototype hang ups many people seem to have patents problem what most people do the majority of people i talk to think the first thing they need to do is go out and spend money to have an expensive patent filled by a patent attorney here’s why that’s wrong many times you’re going to get complaints from manufacturers that your idea needs to be fixed in one way or another no problem you’re creative and they aren’t go back to the drawing board and fix the problems the manufacturer presented the only problem is that if you’ve wasted k to k on a patent now your going to need to file another patent covering the new features of your product another k i don’t think so there is a better way solution my method for you instead spend  on a provisional patent application ppa a ppa gives you one year to fish of the end of the pier to see if anyone is interested in your idea a ppa also allows you to say “patent pending” it’s a huge benefit to the small guy if you come up with a new version of your invention just file another ppa with the additional features with my approach you should be able to get a “go” or “no go” in three weeks to three months make sure to put another one to five months aside for negotiations and you’ll still have many months left on your twelve month ppa then when you license your idea to a manufacturer you’ll put in the contract that the manufacturer is responsible for paying your attorney to upgrade your ppa to a full patent and put it in your name this is how i get multiple patents in my name paid for by manufacturers prototypes problem what most people do people think you need to have a polished and perfect prototype in order to sell an idea i have sold many ideas with very simple prototypes and many without prototypes at all  what people don’t understand is that you are not selling your prototype or your patent i’ll say that again you’re not selling your prototype or patent you are selling the benefits of your idea solution my method for you create a sell sheet what the heck is a “sell sheet” it’s a regular  ½” x ” piece of paper it’s like an ad for your idea it has the big benefit of your product in one sentence at the top maybe a few sub benefits or features in bullets below and a picture or drawing of your idea “oh but i have to build a prototype” many will say no you don’t you don’t need a prototype until you get some interest if you don’t get any interest you haven’t wasted time on a prototype your sell sheet should be like a billboard on the freeway people should be able to glance at it for a few seconds and understand the benefit of buying your invention they don’t need to understand every feature or hear you make clichéd statements like “if we only sell this to  of all households in the country this new idea will make millions” my one line benefit statement for one of my biggest ideas was “i have a new label innovation that ads  more space to your container” that’s it i didn’t need to explain how when i called on the phone they just wanted to know more benefits benefits that’s what you are selling not your patent or prototype stephen in motion repurposing existing products in  minutes for a call sheet model or prototype… to be continued in part ii negotiated royalty rates who to call

brian oberkirch for the inspiration  comments on “stephen dubner — the art of storytelling and facing malcolm gladwell in a fist fight” hey tim are you going to do a  version of the hour work week likelike reply i think more likely a  since it would be the th anniversary 😉 likelike reply stephen dubner has a lot of interesting things to say but high pitch voices are neither soothing nor attractive listening to a podcast is a multisensorial experience that goes beyond great content and people’s voices matter thank you for having a calming low pitch voice tim you are not a perfect podcaster but you have redeeming qualities i’m glad i refrained from listening to cbcnews live instead of the podcast  stephan’s ideas about education were worth it and i don’t like listening to the news likelike reply un mar de fuegos eduardo galeano “un hombre del pueblo de neguá en la costa de colombia pudo subir al alto cielo a la vuelta contó dijo que había contemplado desde arriba la vida humana y dijo que somos un mar de fueguitos el mundo es eso reveló un montón de gente un mar de fueguitos cada persona brilla con luz propia entre todas las demás no hay dos fuegos iguales hay fuegos grandes y fuegos chicos y fuegos de todos los colores hay gente de fuego sereno que ni se entera del viento y gente de fuego loco que llena el aire de chispas algunos fuegos fuegos bobos no alumbran ni queman pero otros arden la vida con tanta pasión que no se puede mirarlos sin parpadear y quien se acerca se enciende” you are a fire likelike reply the fundamental problem with storytelling science is that truth should never get in the way of a good story whereas the opposite is true of good science let a quote from steven pinker – regarding the freak ‘theory’ of crime reduction – explain “any hypothesis that comes out of left field to explain a massive social trend with a single overlooked event will almost certainly turn out to be wrong even if it has some data supporting it at the time” much of what gladwell dubner and co promote is not science and is unfortunately labelled as such with that being said they tell damn good stories and i read them religiously likelike reply stamp collecting is a great hobby for young people my dad who was the vp of bp oil na said he learned more from his stamps and that knowledge helped him in his job more than anything it is all encompassing politlcsart ect likelike reply tim what would be the three books that shaped you likelike reply tim i have been a listener for a while and now i am in school again i find myself actively sending and recommending your podcasts to classmates teachers and friends it’s been a whirlwind adventure given that i am an adoptive son of san francisco just as you are i am preaching your message daily and trying to deconstruct a problem in sports management i would really appreciate a signal for a better way to contact you to ask you some questions as i think it would be fruitful for both of us i am just asking for a short dialogue nothing that will take up brain calories as to this podcast dubner really opened my eyes to how to got his feet wet in new york just after being a musician and an athlete i can relate i will find myself reading his recommended reading and surely become a better follower as maija says “stephan’s ideas about education were worth it” truly fun way to cook my steak and eggs thanks tim hope to hear back from you soon likeliked by  person reply sick and tired of people describing schools as an industry yes load load up those children up as cannon fodder for industry oh and thanks for telling us about the way schools should be run…wait they tried what is being suggested here back in the s in the uk it failed badly maybe it was because they didn’t have the internet back then or virtual reality goggles i was looking forward to this episode and now i just think if he is this ill informed about education what value do his other comments have likelike reply
