results for the quarter as well as a reconciliation of any nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures including a reconciliation of any estimates of the companys economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call with us on the line to discuss the companys results for the quarter are sean healey chairman and chief executive officer nate dalton president and chief operating officer and jay horgen chief financial officer with that ill turn the call over to sean healey sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc thanks selene and good morning everyone amg generated yearoveryear growth in the first quarter across our key performance metrics including record assets under management of  billion a  increase over the first quarter of  and economic earnings per share of  a  increase from the yearago quarter our results reflect the successful execution of our growth strategy including the impact of new affiliates and the excellent investment performance and growth of our existing affiliates during the quarter our affiliates alternative products generated strong positive net client cash flows which were offset by elevated outflows from us equity strategies resulting in modest outflows overall looking ahead as nate will describe we see positive flow momentum across our business over the balance of the year as we continue to see global institutional retail clients increased their allocations to truly active valueadded products even as they may also expand their passive beta exposures given the quality and breadth of our affiliates alternative and differentiated global equities strategies amg is wellpositioned to generate strong longterm organic growth through our strategic focus on areas where we see secular demand trends and where boutique firms excel amg has built one of the largest and broadest alternative product sets in the industry and clients seeking uncorrelated return streams recognized our affiliates as among the best managers in the world with over  billion in assets managed across relative value systematic diversified private equity multistrategy and other alternative products our affiliates in these areas provide true diversification both in terms of crosscorrelation as well as relative to traditional fixed income and equity markets in addition to growing demand for uncorrelated alternative strategies trends favoring alphaoriented products will also benefit highconviction highactive share equity strategies especially in global and emerging market equities which account for approximately onethird of our assets under management we believe that passive equity products will take share from poorly performing core equity products while differentiated truly active strategies especially in nonus equities will continue to see growth of course in every area of asset management the fundamental measure of success is investment performance contrary to the conventional narrative there are active managers which have and will continue to generate alpha amgs partnered with a substantial number of these firms over the past  years and we believe that the best boutique firms are positioned to outperform benchmarks and peers over the long term and across an array of alphaoriented strategies leading independent firms are recognized by clients as among the best managers in the industry weve built amgs business based on the fundamental belief that specialist firms have meaningful competitive advantages in generating alpha including distinct highly focused operating and investment processes alignment of interest through direct equity ownership and unique entrepreneurial cultures amgs partnership approach preserves these attributes across generations of management partners and the advantages of our structure can be seen in our affiliates outstanding longterm performance records as nate will describe further in the first quarter our affiliates continue to generate excellent investment results across a diverse array of differentiated high valueadded strategies amgs partnership approach allows individual affiliates to retain their investment focus and alignment with clients even as amg itself has become one of the largest global asset managers while consolidation is a topic of increasing interest in the asset management industry we believe that consolidation and scale do not enhance and often detract from the primary mission of an active manager alpha generation amgs business model allows us to leverage our global scale on behalf of our affiliates in areas where scale is a benefit such as marketing and compliance but importantly our partnership approach protects the unique operating investment culture of each individual affiliate and the close alignment of client interest preserving the essential advantages in alpha generation which will further extend our affiliates longterm track records of success turning to new investments we continue to make progress in executing on our substantial and unique opportunity to invest in outstanding new affiliates given our proprietary relationship set with the most highly regarded independent firms worldwide along with our reputation and unmatched track record as a partner to our affiliates over the past two decades we are confident that we will continue to generate incremental earnings growth through accretive investments and additional affiliates with the scale of amgs global business today were also able to maintain our commitment to proven capital allocation consistent capital return to shareholders and significant longterm value creation as you know last quarter we initiated a dividend evidencing this commitment and going forward we expect to increase the dividend while continuing to enhance shareholder returns through accretive investments in new affiliates and share repurchases finally and against a backdrop of heightened political and macroeconomic uncertainty amgs business is wellpositioned to generate sustained longterm earnings growth our broad range of alternative strategies and differentiated global equity products is increasingly attractive to clients seeking to balance their passive beta exposures and a more volatile market environment will provide enhanced opportunities for our affiliates to continue to distinguish themselves through meaningful alpha generation lastly the breadth and diversity of our alternative strategies which are uncorrelated with traditional markets and with each other will provide stability and upside opportunity to our earnings and substantial free cash flow across market cycles with that ill turn it to nate to discuss our affiliates results in more detail nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc thanks and good morning everyone as sean said in the first quarter our affiliates and especially our largest affiliates had excellent investment performance across a broad range of alternatives and truly active equity products we continue to believe that the best managers products that deliver excess returns through market cycles whether in traditional or alternative asset classes will remain critical components of client portfolios as these clients need to generate returns to meet their liabilities our affiliates have produced outstanding results over long periods of time and again this quarter many of them generated excess returns extending those longterm track records now ill cover performance in more detail in a moment but first let me provide a bit of context to our slightly negative flows for the quarter there were several underlying themes first we continue to see very good demand for a large number of our alternative products across the full range of client types second consistent with the broader environment we continue to see weakness within us equities finally and most impactful to the first quarter we had two lumpy institutional outflows one in global equity and one in us equity each of the underlying products has performed well and we believe these redemptions were driven by specific client rebalancing decisions now in the case of the lost us equity mandate a portion has already been reallocated to the same affiliate in a different product in the second quarter now looking ahead we feel very good about the positive momentum we now have in the retail and high net worth areas as our product set includes a large number of indemand alternative and global equity products and also as our us equity retail outflows have continued to moderate as absolute and benchmark relative performance has improved in this area we also feel very good about our institutional growth opportunities especially as we begin to move into the primary fundraising cycles for a number of our significant illiquid strategies and in addition our pipeline of one but unfunded institutional mandates include some very large pieces of business now turning to the details for the quarter as a reminder our product categories include alternatives global equities including both developed and emerging markets us equities and multiasset and other strategies in addition well continue to discuss our alternative products at the subcategory level to dimension underlying return in flow dynamics that are lost at the aggregate level now as you may have seen weve introduced our new product category disclosure in the tables of our press release as we believe it helps further describe and contextualize our business now for the specifics and starting with our alternative strategies which account for approximately  of our business by assets within private equity and real assets our affiliates including baring asia eig and pantheon continue to maintain and enhance their solid longterm track records across their flagship offerings as we said before these historical returns will drive strong interest for the upcoming capitalraising cycle in addition each of these firms continues to enhance and broaden our product sets which over time will produce additional significant growth opportunities in the fixed income and equity relative value area major hedge fund indices posted positive returns in the quarter as indicated by the hfri relative value index with a  return the hfri equity hedge index with a  return and the hfri eventdriven activist index with a  return for the period performance across our affiliates was also very strong on an absolute and relative basis as aqr bluemountain capula and valueact all performed well within our multistrategy and other category indices were generally positive for the quarter as indicated by the hfri fund weighted composite return of  against that backdrop most of our affiliate strategies generated good absolute and relative returns in the quarter aqr and first quadrants largest strategy in the category including alternative risk premia and risk parity strategies produced solid positive returns benefiting from their broad portfolio positioning in the quarter as most underlying exposures performed well in our systematic diversified category the socgen trend index fell by about  and against that backdrop results among aqr systematica and winton products were mixed in the quarter but we continue to see good client demand for these strategies as theyve uncorrelated return streams and many of them have historically performed well in strongly downward trending markets turning next to flows in our alternatives calculation for the quarter we had good organic growth with  billion of net inflows supported by both strong retail and institutional sales its also worth pointing out that we generated these positive flows almost entirely across our more liquid alternative subcategories on the other hand within our private equity and more illiquid product set we had continued realization activity from maturing funds without the offset benefit of meaningful fundraising now as we discussed last quarter we have a very significant upcoming fundraising cycle for illiquids thats weighed to the back half of this year and the first half of  although we should start to see some initial activity in the second quarter of this year now moving to our global equities category which accounts for approximately  of our business by assets global developed markets had a strong quarter with the msci world index returning  our affiliates generated excellent returns in the quarter as well with the primary strategies from aqr harding loevner trilogy tweedy browne and veritas outperforming the benchmarks emerging markets provided even stronger returns with the benchmark msci emerging markets index up  in the quarter both aqr and harding loevner outpaces index but genesis lags in the quarter but still maintained an excellent longterm track record within global equities we have  billion in net outflows as growth within our retail and high net worth channels both of which continues to see solid positive momentum was offset by elevated institutional redemption levels most notably the single large institutional redemption i mentioned earlier across global equities more broadly amgs largest affiliates – aqr artemis genesis harding loevner tweedy browne and veritas – all continued to have excellent longterm track records and we feel quite good about where we are with the category as a whole now turning next to us equities which accounts for approximately  of our business by assets market performance was mixed with large cap and growth stocks generating strong returns for the quarter the sp  returned  while the russell  index returned  our performance against these benchmarks was also mixed in the quarter our performance includes frontier gwk southernsun and yacktman although largest strategy the timessquare missed their benchmarks in the quarter within us equities we have  billion in net outflows and thats in line with industrywide trends in the product category while we have a broad array of specialist strategies that we believe will continue to track client demands over time especially within the small and midcap spaces this was a particularly challenging quarter as the one large institutional redemption i mentioned along with overall institutional demand weakness more than offset the continued improvement in retail flows turning finally to our multiasset and other category which accounts for about  of our business by assets and that encompasses multistrategy and balanced mandates in our wealth management affiliates as well as a number of multiasset and specialty fixed income products including municipal bond as well as canadian and uk fixed income strategies now on the wealth side we saw good growth from performance across these generally customized portfolios as well as continued positive net flows in the specially fixed income space performance was generally good and we continued to see solid net flows into the our muni bond and other fixed income strategies overall within the category we had roughly  million in positive net flows now looking ahead with an excellent group of indemand strategies across global and emerging markets equities and a wide range of liquid alternatives coupled with an upcoming significant private equity fundraising cycle were wellpositioned to generate longterm organic growth we also believe that the combination of dedicated local sales and marketing efforts in our affiliates in partnership with the global scale and reach of amgs complementary distribution platforms creates an even greater opportunity to drive significant growth across the business with that let me turn to jay to discuss our financials jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc thank you nate as sean discussed our first quarter results reflect strong yearoveryear growth across our key performance metrics with assets under management of  billion up  from a year ago we continue to meaningfully increase the scale diversity and earnings power of our business as you saw on the release we reported economic earnings per share of  for the first quarter which included net performance fees of  on a gaap basis we reported earnings per share of  turning to our performance metrics for the first quarter aggregate revenue grew  to  billion from a year ago driven by significant growth in equity method revenue due to the impact of our  new investments all of which were equity method affiliates together with stronger markets and a higher level of performance fees the ratio of aggregate revenue to average assets under management increased from a year ago both on a management feeonly basis and in total reflecting our  new investments which added a number of highquality alternative managers at slightly higher management fee rates and also contributed to a higher level of performance fees in the quarter adjusted ebitda grew  to  million from a year ago driven by the impact of our new investments together with stronger markets and a higher level of performance fees and reflected our mix between consolidated and equity method affiliates economic net income grew  to  million from a year ago as a result of lower interest expense as weve continued to reduce leverage economic earnings per share increased  to  from a year ago which includes the full effect of last years equity issuance now turning to more specific modeling items for the first quarter the ratio of adjusted ebitda to average assets under management was  basis points or  basis points excluding performance fees we expect this ratio to be between  basis points and  basis points in the second quarter reflecting a range of net performance fees of  to  per share with regard to our taxes our effective gaap tax rate was  and our cash tax rate was  in the first quarter going forward for modeling purposes we expect our gaap tax rate to be approximately  and our cash tax rate to be approximately  intangiblerelated deferred taxes for the first quarter were  million and in the second quarter we expect this number to remain at approximately  million our share of reported amortization for the first quarter was  million which includes  million of amortization from affiliates accounted for under the equity method amortization increased as a result of our  new investments all of which were equity method affiliates for the second quarter we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately  million our share of interest expense for the first quarter was  million and in the second quarter we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately  million other economic items for the first quarter were  million and for modeling purposes we expect other economic items to be approximately  million per quarter our adjusted weighted average share count for the quarter was approximately  million and we expect it to be approximately  million for the second quarter reflecting continued repurchases finally turning to our balance sheet in the first quarter we initiated cash dividend of  per share and we repurchased  million for approximately  million shares we expect to repurchase an additional  million in the second quarter bringing our total to  million in the first half of  looking forward to the remainder of the year we expect to maintain balance sheet flexibility to fund new investments or repurchase additional shares while also building capacity for the future by delivering including the expected retirement or a  million retail bond in the third quarter which would be accretive to earnings given its relatively high cost with the fullyear effect of our new investments the earnings power of our business has increased generating run rate ebitda of over  billion and we are well positioned to continue to execute on our growth strategy while consistently returning capital to shareholders now well be happy to answer your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session in the interest of time we ask that you each ask one question and invite you to rejoin the queue our first question comes from the line of chris shutler with william blair please proceed with your question chris charles shutler  william blair  co llc hey guys good morning sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc good morning chris chris charles shutler  william blair  co llc so when you say that youre seeing positive flow momentum across the business over the balance of the year can you just break that down a little more and would you feel that way even without the big private equity fundraises nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc yeah so ill start this so i think if you look at our flows overall sort of trends over the last couple years weve generally been generating sort of modest positive flows across the entire business with a significant part coming through the institutional channel and when we look at good momentum in the more retail sides of our business what we – the retail and high net worth parts of our business good positive continued momentum there a lot of that coming through all but also slowing outflows in places like us equities where there had been kind of drags so i feel good about that and then we look at the institutional channel and its certainly got a component of the illiquids and private equity piece that you described and i should also remind as we said in our prepared remarks theres a realization component to that which has kind of been ongoing underneath the business so i think weve got those realizations weve got the pipeline kind of deferred for that but honestly you look at the one on funded mandates and the pipeline of kind of finals activity and all of that we feel good about – there are some very large wins in there in the institutional channel now predicting exactly which quarter are hard and all that but you sort of – you look at the back half of the year – or really the balance of the year which i think is how you framed the question and yeah we feel pretty good about it again any one quarter will have lumpy things in it but we feel good about it over the balance of the year and then you add on top of that the illiquid pipeline which i think we have more – not visibility to the specific amounts but we have pretty good visibility to the track records of the kinds of firms – baring eig pantheon – that are going to be out raising money and you make some conservative estimates about what those firms should be able to do given their track record and the very strong performance theyve been generating and we feel quite good about that sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc and those are attractive flows when they come and as nate noted right now were just getting the outs if you will the realizations without the accompanying flows which over time will be more balanced and obviously some fantastic firms are representing us in those areas so on an overall basis we do feel quite optimistic operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler with credit suisse please proceed with your question craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks good morning sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc good morning craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc hi i was just looking for an update on fee pressure and can you talk about if any of your affiliates have reduced prices in some of their larger products and also when theyre launching newer products are the fees today generally lower than they were five years ago on similar products and then also when youre going into a new platform or big relationship what type of fee concessions could be offered in that and i know like theres a lot of different scenarios there but im just looking for kind of highlevel kind of general data points here sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc jay why dont you start by reminding everyone of the aggregate revenue and fee measure overall jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc yeah sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc and then maybe nate you can give some color jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc hey good morning craig so just at the top level the ratio of our aggregate revenue to average assets under management has actually increased from a year ago its increased on a management feeonly basis as well as a total basis as i have mentioned thats because obviously weve added a number of highquality alternative managers that have higher management fee rates and also contributed to the performance fee opportunity but also our alternative managers are growing as part of our mix the existing affiliates so even when you exclude s new investments our fee rates have been stable to maybe up a bit both on a management fee and total basis and maybe nate if you want to give a little more context to whats happening at the next level nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc sure so i think when we talk about fee pressure obviously at a high level sort of jay did mention  how its happening across the whole business but maybe to just focus on a couple of different dynamics here right so one if you look across many of our affiliates theyve got good track records they are managing their capacity either because of product capacity or just opportunity in the market at the time and so theyre managing their product set pretty carefully and that group of firms is able to sustain competitiveness on kind of flows and all that while maintaining their pricing discipline so theres a category of affiliates that id sort of put in that bucket and then next thing id say is theres definitely parts of the business where theres fee pressure whether its certain product categories certain geographies certain channels and there i think affiliates are having to make those kinds of choices and you can actually see in some ways some of the choices theyre making reflected in the fact that the fee rate for our business overall has been quite stable one piece and you touched on this is we are seeing some of our affiliates kind of lower fees a bit in trade for sort of longer duration whether its in longer lot kind of multiyear kinds of products and we think thats a good trade and again depending on how you look at the pricing structure for those products many of which will also include performance fee component if you think that that longer duration will allow an expanded investment opportunity set and therefore potentially higher performance you can actually get – you can think about those as a little bit the trade between slightly lower management fees for slightly – ultimately higher realized performance fees potentially and then the third point and you touched on this as well but also while there are areas were seeing fee compression thats offset in many respects by what were seeing in product development which is much of which is happening in relatively high fee areas so were seeing lots of increased allocations alternatives for example from retail investors and platforms and so while there are some of the dynamics you talked about if you compare that to much of the other – such products theyre still coming online at very good effective management fee level so you sort of put all those together and hopefully that gives you a sense of the color that sits under the high level that jay described operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill katz with citigroup please proceed with your question william raymond katz  citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much thanks for taking the question i had to join a little bit late unfortunately some of the breaking news in the industry was flowing as well with the continuing calls so i apologize if you called this already can you talk a little bit about in the outflows on the us equity side and maybe institutional i guess you called out a couple of oneoffs so just wondering if you may give a little more detail behind that and then i have a followup question sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc right we did a version of the first question but nate why dont you reinforce that and then bill since thats only half a question well let you ask your second one william raymond katz  citigroup global markets inc thank you nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc so in us equities as we said in the prepared remarks so i said us equities we had outflows in about  billion in the quarter so it grows in about  billion and outflows of about  billion and so what would i say about what was driving it in us equity so at a high level a lot of thats consistent with the rest of the industry but was changed sort of in this quarter id sort of point you to a couple of different dynamics one is we did in our prepared remarks talk about one lumpy large institutional outflow and actually – and then we also mentioned in our prepared remarks that the products performing fine and that client was doing rebalancing and in fact has allocated back to the same affiliate in a different product already in this quarter in a different product as i said and then look the other underlying sort of somewhat positive trend in us equities is we are always continue to see outflows in us retail for us equities we do see that trend – the outflow trend kind of slowing there as well sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc and on an overall basis through the balance of the year we feel quite optimistic about our positive flow momentum and we called out and discussed a range of illiquid products which are raising funds as well in the mix of that go ahead whats your second question bill william raymond katz  citigroup global markets inc okay thank you and i apologize if i go back while you go forward on that one in terms of capital management i think you laid out a pretty shift in policy last quarter with the dividend and then the buyback and i think you mentioned about  million this quarter is only about  million im wondering if you could sort of lay out where do we go from here and how you balance between repurchase dividend growth and maybe new investments sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc you better have jay answer those jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc yeah you might come back to the new investment piece so just on the capital ive mentioned and ill just reiterate that we do expect to repurchase  million in the second quarter and thatll bring our total for the first half to  million and then as we look forward to the back half we do expect to maintain balance sheet flexibility to fund new investments or repurchase additional shares however the one thing that is in our sight is that  million retail bond which we do expect to retire in the third quarter that will add about  on a run rate accretion basis to our earnings and beyond that well evaluate our needs which could include new investments additional share repurchases or further delevering or combination of these things sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc great operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies please proceed with your question daniel thomas fannon  jefferies llc thanks good morning sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc hey dan daniel thomas fannon  jefferies llc i know you guys walked through – backed away from updating guidance on a quarterly basis but i guess if you kind of talk to some of the inputs and where they sit relative to original expectations obviously markets look like theyre doing better but wondering if you can give a little more color on maybe the performance fee outlook and then also the  in performance fees this quarter kind of where those – would affiliates drove that please jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc yeah sure dan so yeah youre right i think on the last call we said that just given the size of our business today and the sort of diversity of it were really likely to just do one time a year at the beginning of year for full guidance but happy to kind of comment on the drivers again i think the first one is just as you saw on the release we start the second quarter at  billion in aum and thats reflective of the closing of all of our  new investments have added an additional  billion in the quarter as well as market appreciation and as you mentioned it has been a strong quarter our blend in the quarter through march  was  and then if you look at it and you bring it forward through last friday our blend is up another  so bringing the total yeartodate to  approximately and as you know our model convention has been  per quarter or  for the first half so were experiencing slightly higher market levels early in the year relative to our model convention the other two main assumptions or inputs that go into – or that can impact our  guidance are performance fees in capital deployment and ill talk about performance fees maybe over the course of the year just on capital which is a more simple one as i just mentioned we do anticipate another  million in repurchases bringing our total to  million in the first half and we do expect our weighted average share count for the whole year to be about  million so thats helpful for modeling the other assumption being performance fees firstly i wanted to say and to address your question with the addition of the  new investments and a number of them report on a lag we do expect performance fees throughout the year and so other than our fourth quarter which tends to be the highest performance fee quarter we do expect the first quarter to be the next highest and then the third obviously the lowest and so as you heard performance fees in the first quarter were  compared to  a year ago we expect the second quarter to be in the range of  to  that is consistent with last years  number for the second quarter and in the third quarter we just dont have that many contracts that are expected to crystallize in the quarter so our expectation is that the third quarter will be just a few pennies of course the fourth quarter is where we experience the bulk of our performance fees and though its still early in the year we are seeing positive performance across a range of our alternative products consistent with our expectations operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert lee with kbw please proceed with your question robert lee  keefe bruyette  woods inc great thanks for taking my call good morning sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc good morning robert lee  keefe bruyette  woods inc i guess i just have at this time a broader question but given your affiliate structure and each your affiliates kind of operating completely – well independently but given the increased demands on scale across the industry in understanding that you provide some – the global distribution that you do provide help that the affiliates wanted with compliance and other things but how do you really best – do you feel like youre efficiently delivering scale across all your affiliates as they operate independently i mean how do you really kind of scale take advantage of that on an administrative and operational basis maybe not so much on the distribution side sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc yeah well look i think scale economies exist in parts of the industry distribution compliance maybe some administrative functions are among them and in those areas we absolutely offer affiliates the advantages of being part of a global scale asset management company and were in conversations building relationships with the largest most important clients and their constituents and advisors around the world so while theres of course always more to be done i think were in a very good place in terms of exploiting those economies of scale i think the more important point which to us seems often lost in broader discussions about the benefits of consolidation is that in many areas of the industry especially in alpha generation its not at all clear that scale is a benefit and in fact in many cases you can see and imagine transactions that involve some integration disturbing the operating and investment culture and it seems to us to be if you look across the history and the industry quite rare that integration transactions actually result in better performance and to the contrary most often they result in worse performance of course our model our business strategy is predicated on preserving and protecting the independent operating and investment culture of our affiliates and to maintain the very strong direct alignment that direct equity ownership brings with clients and so the elements of alpha generation which in our view are most important of course it always requires execution but if you dont start with a focused operating and investment culture you dont start with direct alignment of interest it becomes more challenging and so for us to sustain excellent results and reallow for generation so for us were quite confident that the structure and approach that we have as you look forward and think about the industrys evolution where mediocre equity products mediocre investment products generally are losing share to passive as they should but simultaneously clients both global institutional and retail are increasingly focused on and investing in outstanding alphaoriented products including alternative products as a complement to that passive beta exposure and so for that universe of alphaoriented products in our view you need to have the right ingredients you need to have of course the right product set but you need especially to have underlying firms which are positioned as best they can in terms of alignment and focus to sustain alpha generation and in that respect scale is the enemy not the friend operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please proceed with your question brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much good morning guys can we just try to segment the private equity component of the alternative business a little better in terms of – i dont know if we can dimension the actual realizations that youre seeing and then when you talk about the fundraising cycle are you – maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the product sets coming into and i assume youre counting that when it becomes feepaying as opposed to just raised and not feepaying and then are there different pricing structures or agreements rather that would change the sort of the fee rate that youre overall – youve seen overall in your institutional services  jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc yeah so i think you understand the pricing structures correctly so it is as they come on our fee bank so let me back up and try and help dimension the book so theres a few different – theres a number of different affiliates who have products in the kind of the private equity and what were calling the private equity and real asset bucket the substrategy if you want to call that includes firms like as sort of the primary ones firms like baring asia firms like eig and firms like pantheon so these are firms that are leaders in their respective areas sort of asia in private equity as well into real estate and now increasingly credit eig in the energy space in a few different ways in pantheon both in private equity primaries secondaries coinvests and increasingly infrastructure and real assets as well and so its a broad view and there are other affiliates implementing others who have products in this area as well so very broad group and as sean said earlier its really just the – kind of just the accident of how the calendar worked out with the pace of realizations happening – for several of these – happening to come ahead of the timing of raising new funds and i think we talked about a bit maybe last quarter there were also some other things in there right so eig you can imagine being slightly slowed by energy prices and those kinds of things so it just sort of worked out that the realizations are ahead of the fundraisings and so when we look to the back – i think the way we characterized in our prepared remarks its the back half of this the first half of next although again we should start to see some things in the second quarter it just stacked up at sort of primary products so the terms are all – have sort of primary products and then are also expanding their product sets into other areas and so i dont want to imply that theres been no activity but the primary products as they move into those fundraising cycles thats just how they end up getting weighted and it really did just happen to come across those firms so i wouldnt just call one or two out and describe it that way operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america please proceed with your question michael roger carrier  bank of america merrill lynch thanks guys just given the strength on the retail side just had a question on the institutional and maybe a few clarifications just given what you guys said in terms of the outlook so one i guess just on the outflows in the quarter was any of that performancedriven or was it the trends that were seeing in the industry in terms of some of the vast  pressure and then just in terms of that fund cycle i dont know if you can somewhat size – i know you cant usually give us what the funds that are being raised and the anticipation of the fund size but more the funds that are currently being invested like what the fund size is so we can kind of get a sense on like what the base of that asset raise could be and then i guess same thing on the realizations if you have anything whether its for the quarter for the last  months on like how significant that has been in the line where you have client cash outflows and realizations because a lot of people look at that a little differently in terms of outflows versus realizations being part of the private equity of the real asset business so couple questions there but just trying to shed a little bit more light on the institutional side sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc sure just at the highest level and then ill turn to nate the us equity product set has of course exposure to the same kinds of structural pressures that the broader industry is facing but were actually seeing over time a narrowing of the outflows and i think what we have this quarter were a couple of oneoff institutional outflows that were actually if you look at the underlying affiliates were not performancerelated so if you look past that and extrapolate from the current trends and look at the performance of our underlying affiliates thats what gives us the confidence nate do you want to add to that nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc sure so yeah i think that covers the sort of the backwardlooking piece a bit and then i think looking forward i think – let me start with private equity and real assets segment part of your question so i think what weve said on the last call just to try to help you dimension kind of the potential incremental impact of that cycle i think we said probably about  billion net i think was the number that we used so just as a way to dimension those we say cant – obviously we cant go into sort of specifically how theyre fundraising each products but also the other thing is while we do have – as i described in answer to an earlier question while we do have a decent amount of visibility these are very highquality firms with really good track records both on the investment track records as well as fundraising track records and so we can have a high degree of confidence as they go into the fundraising cycle and the products as i said range from whether its asian private equity or real estate or credit through the energy product set into secondaries and whatnot but if you look across that product set we have a pretty good sense of how theyre thinking at least and have seen kind of the work theyre doing around dimensioning the demand for those products so feel like while we cant know the exact sizes of them we can have pretty good sense directionally and then i think overall as we sort of think about the flows in the institutional channel sort of the short term ahead as sean said normalizing for the lumpy outflows one of which was in global equities one of which was in us equities while we do see a little bit of softness continuing in us equities we feel really good about the demand were seeing and actually the accounts weve seen that are won but not yet funded both especially in alternatives but also in some of the global equity areas so yeah feel good about that over the longer term operator thank you our next question comes from the line of patrick davitt with autonomous research please proceed with your question patrick davitt  autonomous research us lp hey good morning guys sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc good morning patrick davitt  autonomous research us lp i have a couple more around outflows first on the us equity outflow you mentioned that has reallocated this quarter why wouldnt that just be a straight transfer was there just a longer decision process between what they actually wanted to put it in and the second one if you could would be to qualify the commentary around the pipeline relative to last quarter and yearoveryear even if its as general as matter nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc okay well on the first – this is my memory but im the first i believe it really is as funny as the accident of literally quarter timing patrick davitt  autonomous research us lp okay nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc i think it was right at the end of one quarter and then the first day of the next month on the other quarter just literally deweigh it  patrick davitt  autonomous research us lp okay nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc though the first quarter worked out so i think it was – at my memory its literally just the hatch  sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc surprisingly the client was indifferent to where our quarterly reporting flows nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc yes exactly so i think that was that one but the – and then on qualifying looking forward so i think the – we feel really good as i said earlier about the kind of won but not funded and some of those will take some time to fund the wonbutnotfunded contracts and all that and then id say the kind of the rps  and finals and kind of the activity levels i think are sort of good and consistent with as i think we talked about the elevated – we have talked about the activity last quarter in sort of finals and i think the overall activity levels remains good operator thank you our next question is a followup from the line of robert lee with kbw please proceed with your question robert lee  keefe bruyette  woods inc thanks and thanks for taking my followup i just had a question on flows i mean obviously were all focusing on the gross inflow the outflow the  billion but maybe economically the  billion outflow is that a good indication of kind of the ebit contribution of flows if we were thinking a bit in that context or given the mix of affiliates and asset classes was there a positive ebit contribution from – despite of having the kind of headline asset outflow jay c horgen  affiliated managers group inc so yeah i appreciate that question because theres a lot of questions on flows and when you look at our aum table youll note that the flows are the smallest number on the page net and surely the  billion of new investments or the  billion of market swamp set  number so does fx event this quarter and the impact of those flows are proportionate to our business so i think the flows as a percentage were like  down and thats about what it impacted our earnings sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc and said differently i think our additional disclosure around aggregate revenue and ratios to assets so that youre getting a sense of what the stability of the fee level is over time is important i think we – and nate had a good answer to this earlier so ill refer you to that while – rather than restating it but we feel good about how our overall business is positioned and how affiliates are responding to challenges in the broader environment and while there are some challenges i think were pleased that are business and our affiliates are holding up very well and what youre seeing in contrast to others in the industry what youre seeing at amg is real stability in the fee levels operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co hey hey everybody good morning nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc good morning alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co sorry just another one around some of the channel dynamic in the quarter i wanted to head on the high net worth channel it looks like that the flows there are a bit softer than what weve seen in the past in the beginning of the year so i was wondering if you could give us a little more color on whats kind of happening underneath and again more importantly the forward backdrop nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc got it so focusing in on the high net worth channel yeah so just to dimension for a second so as we said in the prepared remarks right so another positive quarter i do think if you look i think kind of up quarteroverquarter and down a bit from the very beginning of last year which were – especially that second quarter which is a very strong gross sale quarter and low net outflow quarter so in this quarter we had about  billion of gross sales  million redemptions and spent  positive quarters in a row so we feel really good about kind of the stable steady contribution that were getting from high net worth business in terms of dimension the pieces underneath that i think in the prepared remarks we broke it into the two categories and you think about the wealth management affiliates which had positive flows but were also seeing pretty strong and sustained flows into the sma businesses and kind of the biggest contributors for us there are sort of strong global equity flows and also municipal bonds including in both cases ones that are sold through our amg funds us platform so feel good about that and we are seeing some good momentum on the – and i think consistent with some of the underlying industry dynamics on the sma side so sort of longer term maybe to finish off that – answer that question i do think that – sorry we think that separately managed account market has a lot of potential and traction and we have strong products there and some of this as i said is responding to the way platforms are moving as they anticipated the deal overall so feel good about the momentum there operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please proceed with your question brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my followup just appreciate the asset class disclosure that youve got maybe if you can talk a little bit about the quantitative strategy contribution and we can see aqr with a little over  billion on the mutual fund side positive flows in the quarter and maybe not getting firmspecific but if you can talk about what you would view as the overall contribution of floats from quantitative strategies and is that in own alternatives or would you characterize some of that in multiasset as well nathaniel dalton  affiliated managers group inc yeah so i think maybe just to step back for a second and talk about – when we think about the firms that are maybe ill say more quantitative because i think most of our affiliates have some quantitative element to their strategies but when we think about what are sort of – what would be broadly put into that sort of quantitative bucket  that makes so one as you know very strong franchise in the alternative space across a number of affiliates you think about firms like aqr and winton and systematica and first quadrant bluemountain capula i would even put many of their products into those kinds of buckets and think about their strategies so i think theyre very strong franchise across a number of affiliates in alternatives i do think it includes sort of equities franchises as well again across several affiliates and i think you could put into that both sort of the more traditional sort of client equity kinds of products and strategies you might also put into that sort of the factor – so sort of socalled factoring and smart beta which lots of people are talking about now you could put that there as well and i think a couple of our affiliates in that case most notably aqr have quite strong – have really been pioneers and have quite strong franchises there yeah so i think this is definitely broader than just – in the alternatives category and i do think it also – and youve alluded to this in your comment you also see it coming as a strong franchise across different channels for us as well sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc yeah maybe just add to that i think there as we all know has been an increasing level of discussion around the rule of technology and especially technology as it relates to investment processes and products and i think its a broad topic but its important to underscore the degree to which the leaders in the industry include a handful of specialist firms and were very pleased that that group includes a number of amg affiliates aqr winton systematica first quadrant we have firms which are leading the development of advanced machine learning artificial intelligence applications which over time i think will play an increasingly important role and each in their way these firms are innovating and developing products all really at the highest level of the industry so as you think about that broad trend unfolding over time we feel very good about how amg is positioned to benefit from it operator thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions ill now turn the floor back to mr healey for any final remarks sean m healey  affiliated managers group inc thank you again for joining us this morning as youve heard were pleased with our results for the quarter and were confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value through the organic growth of our existing affiliates create investments in new affiliates and consistent capital return to investors we look forward to speaking with you next

through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
