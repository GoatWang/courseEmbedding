life insurance expand all collapse all what is life insurance and why do i need it a death in the family is not only emotionally devastating it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family suddenly without the deceased’s income paying the mortgage or providing for a childs college education may become much more difficult    those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death in return you make periodic payments called premiums premiums can be based on factors such as age gender medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase in the event of your passing life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select your beneficiaries who can use the money as they see fit including replacing lost income covering basic living expenses paying household debts estate taxes and funeral expenses funding a child’s education supplementing retirement savings what kinds of life insurance can i get at work life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to  years if you stop paying premiums the insurance stops term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy but they do not build cash value they may also give you the option to port that is you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company generally you should consider a term life insurance policy to get valuable coverage at an affordable price help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses supplement a permanent policy permanent life insurance policies do not expire they are intended to protect your loved ones permanently as long as you pay your premiums some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value that means the value of the policy will grow each year taxdeferred until it matches the face value of the policy the cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals and can be used for a variety of purposes this type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates  consider a permanent insurance policy if you want protection for life payments that stay the same each year to put additional money into the policy on a taxfavored basis cash value you can use while you are living what are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family if your employer offers a group plan consider signing up for advantages that may include competitive group rates guaranteed issue meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam convenient payroll deductions easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that’s right for you the confidence of knowing that your employer has reviewed and selected the plan all you have to do is sign up and sometimes enrollment is automatic how much life insurance do i need while you won’t be able to pinpoint the amount you’ll need to the penny you can make a sound estimate  your goal should be to develop a life insurance plan that following your death will allow your family to live comfortably without your economic contribution also consider the effect of inflation over time the amount needed for retirement or college  years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today to estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need first calculate everything you now provide for your family including salary benefitshealth insurance k and retirement savings personal services you perform for your family such as child care cooking home maintenance etc then subtract your personal expenses including annual spending on personal needs such as food clothing entertainment etc how much does life insurance cost life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think in fact many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price premiums are typically based on factors such as age sex height and weight health status including whether or not you smoke participation in highrisk occupations life insurance gets more expensive as you get older and the type of coverage you choose will also affect your premium rates for term insurance are typically lower while rates for permanent policies are typically higher does metlife offer an individual one year term life insurance product yes  metlife’s one year term products offer affordable protection when you require insurance for the short term these

tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity this information was based on data collected in the build study of  collected by the society of actuaries this data followed patients for  years from  and was collected from  life insurance companies in canada and the united states representing  million people these “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population this study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose it was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival the ‘’’metropolitan tables’’’ included ‘’small’’ ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames based on elbowgirth measured using calipers as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue they presented weight ranges for height sex and body frame again associated with the lowest mortality the midpoint of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” initial weightideal weight this led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons

england and met life agree to merge operations by michael quint published august   the boards of the metropolitan life insurance company and the new england mutual life insurance company agreed yesterday to merge combining the financial strength of met life with new england mutuals affluent customer base with the merger the assets of met life the nations secondlargest insurance company would grow to  billion  not enough to dislodge the prudential insurance company of america which has  billion in assets from first place new england which is based in boston is ranked no  because both met life based in new york and new england are mutual companies owned by their policyholders the merger would not entail any cash payment or issuance of new shares as in mergers of stockholderowned companies instead new englands  policyholders who own a company with  billion of capital would become partowners of an enlarged metlife with  billion of capital and  million customers including those with employersponsored group policies the merger is subject to approval of policyholders of both companies sales in the upscale market have grown much more rapidly than sales to middleincome households that are the mainstay at met life however new englands ratings have fallen in recent years because of real estate losses and the merger is expected to give the company financial strength and higher ratings that should help it expand its sales all new and existing new england policies will be backed by met life under the terms both companies would continue selling insurance under their own names but their finances would be combined under the stronger met life umbrella the insurance industry including many giant mutual companies owned by their policyholders has been in flux weak profits combined with faltering sales from traditional networks of agents and the loss of business to alternative investments like mutual funds have spurred many companies to push for change by selling nonessential businesses merging and cutting costs another big merger announcement of mutual insurance companies is expected in the middle of september when directors of massachusetts mutual of springfield mass and connecticut mutual which is based in hartford are expected to approve a merger that could create one of the countrys  largest insurers executives at both companies previously announced they were in merger talks and said they expected a merger would strengthen the financial standing of connecticut mutual and allow for costcutting by eliminating many duplications the insurance industry as a whole faces big challenges to bring down their costs and increase revenues and the met life and new england mutual merger just raises the hurdle a bit higher for other companies said larry mayewski head life insurance company analyst at the a m best company an oldwick nj ratings firm the greatest growth opportunity for insurers he said is in the market niche served by new england  highincome individuals in the  to  age group who need advice about retirement savings and estate planning customer preferences have changed with less interest in insurance as protection against disaster and more of a focus on insurance as a product for retirement planning mr mayeweski said that means companies like met life need better trained sales agents who can sell more sophisticated products not just the usual products sold in the past i expect that mergers like this will tend to be much more frequent said robert w stein head of the insurance group at ernst  young the accounting firm a lot of companies may not have the stomach for it because of inertia and the strains it puts on management he said but most mutual companies will need more capital to grow a key way to acquire more capital mr stein said is to arrange mergers that broaden an insurers business into more attractive markets as in the case of met life and new england or by cutting costs by eliminating duplicated jobs in the met lifenew england merger however cost cutting is not a major issue harry p kamen met lifes chief executive said the  million annual savings that might be achieved in the next few years was much less than the savings he expected to squeeze out of met life even without a merger met lifes business plan calls for profits to grow to  billion in  from nearly  billion last year with less than half of the  million improvement coming from cost cutting met life executives said they were eager to make use of new englands more sophisticated computer system which will eliminate the need for met life to spend  million to  million to improve its own system the new england system created with needs of wealthy customers in mind can immediately produce updated account statements and projections that would have to be produced slowly at met life one at a time met lifes  to  agents who sell to the same sort of customers as new englands  agents would continue with the met life name but would rely on the products and service provided by new england in addition all policies of more than  sold by met lifes main force of  agents would be issued by new england mutual rating agencies in general gave the merger favorable reviews saying that new englands ratings might be raised while holding met lifes ratings constant at a m best new englands rating is a the fourth highest while met life was a the second highest the only dissenter from that pattern was moodys investors service which said it continued to review met lifes current aa rating the second highest for possible downgrading the merger with new england is the latest in a series of deals by mr kamen a slightly built sometimes selfeffacing lawyer who became met lifes chief executive in early  he still takes the subway to work sometimes before the agreement on the new england merger the largest ever among mutual life insurers mr kamen sold met lifes health care and health insurance businesses for stock and cash that could eventually total  billion and give it  percent ownership of united healthcare of minnetonka minn one of the nations largest health insurers and operators of health maintenance organizations he collected an additional  million this year by selling met lifes home mortgage and century  real estate brokerage subsidiaries mr kamen said he was interested in converting to a stockholderowned company at this time because we dont need the additional capital he noted that met life now had other options to raise capital and could for example issue new stock of the new england investment companies a publicly traded subsidiary of new england mutual which manages  billion of assets the deal with new engalnd was born last december when terry lennon a former senior
