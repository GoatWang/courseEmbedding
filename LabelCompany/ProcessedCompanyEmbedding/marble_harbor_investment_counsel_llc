vital role in getting those greek ships to troy nowadays calchas would be an economist instead of pondering avian migratory patterns he would be analyzing economic data and global events no doubt he’d still be making predictions and like calchas he would have a wide and hungry audience after  years we haven’t changed much uncertainty still makes us wring our hands with angst and to calm our frayed nerves we turn to the oracle of cnbc and the like hoping that apollo will guide our ship to port regrettably forecasts by our modernday prognosticators are not as reliable as those of their

in a world where down is up and backward is forward in europe and japan  trillion of sovereign debt and even some corporate debt has a negative yield subverting the traditional relationship between lender and borrower with investors paying bond issuers for the privilege of using their money likewise the conventional logic concerning the role fixed income and equities play in a portfolio is also turned on its head customarily one would look to the fixed income portion of the portfolio to provide stability and income if more income were the goal then you could allocate more to bonds but in today’s jabberwockian setting if we sell equities and buy bonds chances are income will actually decrease to successfully invest in the red queen’s world we must accept our new surroundings and adapt accordingly download pdf q  on sunday june  we were lucky enough to watch lebron james and steph curry two of the best basketball players in history battle in game  of the nba championship title the advantage oscillated from golden state to cleveland and back again the score was close all the way through to the end so much so that no one could predict the outcome with certainty less than a week later we watched in disbelief as the uk voted to leave the european union this competition too had wild swings with “leave” ahead and then the tragic death of jo cox pushing “remain” into the lead even as the polls were closing the vote was too close to call there is a word for guessing about sports events gambling but so often when people talk about geopolitical events they justify trading around those events by calling it investing let’s be clear no one knew what the result of the brexit vote would be any more than they knew who would prevail in game  and consequently trades based on the vote’s outcome were outright gambling download pdf q  commentary if you closed your eyes on december st and opened them again on pdf q  commentary though markets swung dramatically during  in the

understanding you your financial goals return objectives and risk tolerance is vital to an investment counseling relationship we begin with an indepth discussion of how your investments fit into your overall financial picture from this conversation your investment counselor develops an asset allocation framework which he or she then implements with a combination of common stocks fixed income and alternative assets as appropriate the investment counselor you work with is the professional who makes the investment decisions in your portfolio regular communication between investment counselor and client is a crucial part of the management process our clients receive a personal letter every quarter from their investment counselor reviewing the current investment environment any recent changes in their specific portfolio along with updates on companies they own at marble harbor we have chosen to focus exclusively on managing your investment portfolio this allows us to concentrate on the most critical aspect of your financial picture we work in concert with your other specialized professionals such as tax accountants attorneys and estate planners to coordinate your personal financial

homeservicesphilosophyour teamcase studiesruminationscommentaryour communitycontact investment philosophy equity we make longterm investments in strong businesses within attractive industries these enterprises must have sustainable competitive advantages consistent patterns of growth strong profit and cash flow characteristics solid balance sheets and proven management teams we find these companies through a process of extensive primary research this entails regular meetings with numerous company managements that lead to a thorough understanding of the underlying businesses within each enterprise valuation also plays an important role in our analysis since paying too much for even a great company can lead to a poor investment company fundamentals and valuations drive portfolio construction and sector weightings we do not chase constantly fluctuating macro or economic opinions portfolios are composed of attractively valued companies that demonstrate the ability to grow earnings and cash flow at above average rates over long periods of time earnings growth drives stock prices and dividends our focus is on the long term because the direction of stock prices in the short term is unknowable to control risk our portfolios are diversified across economic sectors and stay fully invested in our opinion market timing is a fools errand our extensive research generally allows us to hold companies for an extended period of time this low turnover is a natural element of our investment work and it is particularly appropriate for taxable accounts fixed income client assets are invested in bonds with an eye toward capital preservation and a steady stream of income the core portion of a clients fixed income portfolio is not an appropriate place to take significant risk we implement a conservative common sense approach to fixed income investing by building a laddered medium term high quality portfolio this strategy seeks to minimize credit and reinvestment rate risk for our clients our approach to fixed income analysis is similar to the one we employ with equities we concentrate on the health and sustainability of the underlying government entity or company rather than relying on rating agencies or credit insurance because we intend to hold the bonds until maturity quality is important alternative assets alternative assets can offer greater potential for investment returns as well as diversification where appropriate for eligible clients we have developed a platform through which we can offer our clients access to a carefully selected group of private equity venture capital high yield real estate and commodity funds we perform extensive due diligence and look for managers who carry the same high standards as we do in our public company investments we allocate capital to these asset classes only when we feel the valuations are particularly compelling diversification for its own sake can be detrimental as well we are sensitive to the illiquidity of many of these sorts of investments and so are more demanding of those we select further we limit our investments to funds that charge a fee we believe to be reasonable  copyright  marble harbor

developments creep up on us unexpectedly many take a long time to emerge and others come more quickly – as has happened since the recent financial crash today we can see some very important new factors in the equation which make it clear that we are in a changed investment world this world appears likely to be more difficult and uncertain than the generally comfortable environment that

given signs of a bottoming in the latter and pnrs latecycle sales mix we think this outgrowth is unlikely to accelerate while its markets are strong now we note that pnrs cyclicality was no lower than

have increased by about bps over the past three yearsrelated link cowen  company downgrades pentair to underperformwe view five business units  percent of sales as underearning today in that they

reduce the leveragethere is a risk that pnr uses the proceeds from selling assets that may be close to a cyclical trough vc to buy businesses that may be close to a cyclical peak in water ts and the company seems willing to return to a similar balance sheet leverage level x as before the vc sale took place  who are some of pentair plcs key competitors some companies that are related to pentair
