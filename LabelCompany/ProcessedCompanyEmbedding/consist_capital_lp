circuit of money capital the circular movement  of capital takes place in three stages which according to the presentation in volume i form the following series first stage the capitalist appears as a buyer on the commodity and the labourmarket his money is transformed into commodities or it goes through the circulation act m — c second stage productive consumption of the purchased commodities by the capitalist he acts as a capitalist producer of commodities his capital passes through the process of production the result is a commodity of more value than that of the elements entering into its production third stage the capitalist returns to the market as a seller his commodities are turned into money or they pass through the circulation act c — m hence the formula for the circuit of moneycapital is m — c  p  c — m the dots indicating that the process of circulation is interrupted and c and m designating c and m increased by surplusvalue the first and third stages were discussed in book i only in so far as this was necessary for the understanding of the second stage the process of production of capital for this reason the various forms which capital takes on in its different stages and which now assumes and now strips off in the repetition of its circuit were not considered these forms are now the direct object of our study in order to conceive these forms in their pure state one must first of all discard all factors which have nothing to do with the changing or building of forms as such it is therefore taken for granted here not only that the commodities are sold at their values but also that this takes place under the same conditions throughout likewise disregarded therefore are any changes of value which might occur during the movement in circuits i first stage m — c  m — c represents the conversion of a sum of money into a sum of commodities the purchaser transforms his money into commodities the sellers transform their commodities into money what renders this act of the general circulation of commodities simultaneously a functionally definite section in independent circuit of some individual capital is primarily not the form of the act but its material content the specific usecharacter of the commodities which change places with the money these commodities are on the one hand means of production on the other labourpower material and personal factors in the production of commodities whose specific nature must of course correspond to the special kind of articles to be manufactured if we call labourpower l and the means of production mp then the sum of commodities to be bought c is equal to l  mp or more briefly clmp m — c considered as to its substance is therefore represented by m — clmp that is to say m — c is composed of m — l and m — mp the sum of money m is separated into two parts one of which buys labourpower the other means of production these two series of purchases belong to entirely different markets the one to the commoditymarket proper the other to the labourmarket aside from this qualitative division of the sum of commodities into which m is transformed the formula m — clmp also represents a most characteristic quantitative relation we know that the value or price of labourpower is paid to its owner who offers it for sale as a commodity in the form of wages that is to say as the price of a sum of labour containing surpluslabour for instance if the daily value of labourpower is equal to the product of five hours labour valued at three shillings this sum figures in the contract between the buyer and seller as the price or wages for say ten hours of labour if such a contract is made for instance with  labourers they are supposed to work altogether  hours per day for the purchaser and one half of this time or  hours equal to  days of labour of  hours each represents nothing but surplus labour the quantity and the volume of the means of production to be purchased must be sufficient for the utilisation of this mass of labour m — clmp then does not merely express the qualitative relation indicating that a certain sum of money say £ is exchanged for a corresponding sum of means of production and labourpower but also a quantitative relation between l the part of the money spent for labourpower and mp the part spent for means of production this relation is determined at the outset by the quantity of excess labour of surpluslabour to be expended by a certain number of labourers if for instance in a spinningmill the weekly wage of its  labourers amounts to £ £ must be spent for means of production if this is the value of the means of production which a weekly labour of  hours  of which are surpluslabour transforms into yarn it is immaterial here how much additional value in the form of means of production is required in the various lines of industry by the utilisation of additional labour the point merely is that the part of the money spent for means of production — the means of production bought in m — mp — must absolutely suffice ie must at the outset be calculated accordingly must be procured in corresponding proportion to put it another way the quantity of means of production must suffice to absorb the amount of labour to be transformed by it into products if the means of production at hand were insufficient the excess labour at the disposal of the purchaser could not be utilised his right to dispose of it is futile if there were more means of production than available labour they would not be saturated with labour would not be transformed into products as soon as m — clmp is completed the purchaser has at his disposal more than simply the means of production and labourpower required for the production of some useful article he disposes of a greater capacity to render labourpower fluent or a greater quantity of labour than is necessary for the replacement of the value of this labourpower and he has at the same time the means of production requisite for the realisation or materialisation of this quantity of labour in other words he has at his disposal the factors making for the production of articles of a greater value than that of the elements of production — the factors of production of a mass of commodities containing surplusvalue the value advanced by him in moneyform has now assumed a bodily form in which it can be incarnated as a value generating surplusvalue in the shape of commodities in brief value exists here in the condition or form of productive capital which has the factor of creating value and surplusvalue let us call capital in this form p now the value of p is equal to that of l  mp it is equal to m exchanged for l and mp m is the same capitalvalue as p only it has a different mode of existence it is capitalvalue in the state or form of money — moneycapital m — clmp or its general form m — c a sum of purchases of commodities an act of the general circulation of commodities is therefore at the same time — as a stage in the independent circuit of capital — a transformation of capitalvalue from its moneyform into its productive form more briefly it is the transformation of moneycapital into productive capital in the diagram of the circuit which we are here discussing money appears as the first depository of capitalvalue and moneycapital therefore represents the form in which capital is advanced capital in the form of moneycapital is in a state in which it can perform the functions of money in the present case the functions of a universal means of purchase and universal means of payment the lastnamed inasmuch as labourpower though first bought is not paid for until it has been put into operation to the extent that the means of production are not found ready on the market but have to be ordered first money in m — mp likewise serves as a means of payment this capacity is not due to the fact that moneycapital is capital but that it is money on the other hand capitalvalue in the form of money cannot perform any other functions but those of money what turns the moneyfunctions into functions of capital is the definite role they play in the movement of capital and therefore also the interrelation of the stage in which these functions are performed with the other stages of the circuit of capital take for instance the case with which we are here dealing money is here converted into commodities the combination of which represents the bodily form of productive capital and this form already contains latently potentially the result of the process of capitalist production a part of the money performing the function of moneycapital in m — clmp assumes by consummating the act of circulation a function in which it loses its capital character but preserves its moneycharacter the circulation of moneycapital m is divided into m — mp and m — l into the purchase of means of production and the purchase of labourpower let us consider the lastnamed process by itself m — l is the purchase of labourpower by the capitalist it is also the sale of labourpower — we may here say of labour since the form of wages is assumed — by the laborer who owns it what is m — c   m — l for the buyer is here as in every other purchase l — m   c — m for the seller the laborer it is the sale of his labourpower this is the first stage of circulation or the first metamorphosis of the commodity buch i kap iii aenglish edition ch iii a — ed it is for the seller of labour a transformation of his commodity into the moneyform the laborer spends the money so obtained gradually for a number of commodities required for the satisfaction of his needs for articles of consumption the complete circulation of his commodity therefore appears as l — m — c that is to say first as l — m   c — m and secondly as m — c hence in the general form of the simple circulation of commodities c — m — c money is in this case merely a passing means of circulation a mere medium in the exchange of one commodity for another m — l is the characteristic moment in the transformation of moneycapital into productive capital because it is the essential condition for the real transformation of value advanced in the form of money into capital into a value producing surplusvalue m — mp is necessary only for the purpose of realising the quantity of labour bought in the process m — l which was discussed from this point of view in book i part ii under the head of “the transformation of money into capital” we shall have to consider the matter at this point also from another angle relating especially to moneycapital the form in which capital manifests itself generally m — l is regarded as characteristic of the capitalist mode of production however not at all for the reason given above that the purchase of labourpower represents a contract of purchase which stipulates for the delivery of a quantity of labour in excess of that needed to replace the price of the labourpower the wages hence delivery of surpluslabour the fundamental condition for the capitalisation of the value advanced or for the production of surplusvalue which is the same thing on the contrary it is so regarded because of its form since money in the form of wages buys labour and this is the characteristic mark of the money system nor is it the irrationality of the form which is taken as characteristic on the contrary one overlooks the irrational the irrationality consists in the fact that labour itself as a valuecreating element cannot have any value nor can therefore any definite amount of labour have any value expressed in its price in its equivalence to a definite quantity of money but we know that wages are but a disguised form a form in which for instance the price of one day’s labourpower presents itself as the price of the labour rendered fluent by this labourpower in one day the value produced by this labourpower in say six hours of labour is thus expressed as the value of twelve hours’ functioning or operation of the labourpower m — l is regarded as the characteristic feature the hallmark of the socalled money system because labour there appears as the commodity of its owner and money therefore as the buyer — hence on account of the moneyrelation ie the sale and purchase of human activity money however appears very early as a buyer of socalled services without the transformation of m into moneycapital and without any change in the general character of the economic system it makes no difference to money into what sort of commodities it is transformed it is the universal equivalent of all commodities which show if only by their prices that ideally they represent a certain sum of money anticipate their transformation into money and do not acquire the form in which they may be converted into usevalues for their owners until they change places with money once labourpower has come into the market as the commodity of its owner and its sale takes the form of payment for labour assumes the shape of wages its purchase and sale is no more startling than the purchase and sale of any other commodity the characteristic thing is not that the commodity labourpower is purchasable but that labourpower appears as a commodity by means of m — clmp the transformation of moneycapital into productive capital the capitalist effects the combination of the objective and personal factors of production so far as they consist of commodities if money is transformed into productive capital for the first time or if it performs for the first time the function of moneycapital for its owner he must begin by buying means of production such as buildings machinery etc before he buys any labourpower for as soon as he compels labourpower to act in obedience to his sway he must have means of production to which he can apply it as labourpower this is the capitalist’s presentation of the case the labourer’s case is as follows the productive application of his labourpower is not possible until it is sold and brought into connection with means of production before its sale labourpower exists therefore separately from the means of production from the material conditions of its application in this state of separation it cannot be used either directly for the production of usevalues for its owner or for the production of commodities by the sale of which he could live but from the moment that as a result of its sale it is brought into connection with means of production it forms part of the productive capital of its purchaser the same as the means of production true in the act m — l the owner of money and the owner of labourpower enter only into the relation of buyer and seller confront one another only as moneyowner and commodityowner in this respect they enter merely into a moneyrelation yet at the same time the buyer appears also from the outset in the capacity of an owner of means of production which are the material conditions for the productive expenditure of labourpower by its owner in other words these means of production are in opposition to the owner of the labourpower being property of another on the other hand the seller of labour faces its buyer as labourpower of another which must be made to do his bidding must be integrated into his capital in order that it may really become productive capital the class relation between capitalist and wagelaborer therefore exists is presupposed from the moment the two face each other in the act m — l l — m on the part of the laborer it is a purchase and sale a moneyrelation but a purchase and sale in which the buyer is assumed to be a capitalist and the seller a wagelaborer and this relation arises out of the fact that the conditions required for the realisation of labourpower viz means of subsistence and means of production are separated from the owner of labourpower being the property of another we are not concerned here with the origin of this separation it exists as soon as m — l goes on the thing which interests us here is this if m — l appears here as a function of moneycapital or money as the form of existence of capital the sole reason that money here assumes the role of a means of paying for a useful human activity or service hence by no means in consequence of the function of money as a means of payment money can be expended in this form only because labourpower finds itself in a state of separation from its means of production including the means of subsistence as means of production of the labourpower itself and because this separation can be overcome only by the sale of the labourpower to the owner of the means of production because therefore the functioning of labourpower which is not at all limited to the quantity of labour required for the reproduction of its own price is likewise the concern of its buyer the capitalrelation during the process of production arises only because it is inherent in the act of circulation in the different fundamental economic conditions in which buyer and seller confront each other in their class relation it is not money which by its nature creates this relation it is rather the existence of this relation which permits of the transformation of a mere moneyfunction into a capitalfunction in the conception of moneycapital for the time being we deal with the latter only within the confines of the special function in which it faces us here two errors run parallel to each other or cross each other in the first place the functions performed by capitalvalue in its capacity as moneycapital which it can perform precisely owing to its moneyform are erroneously derived from its character as capital whereas they are due only to the moneyform of capitalvalue to its form of appearance as money in the second place on the contrary the specific content of the moneyfunction which renders it simultaneously a capitalfunction is traced to the nature of money money being here confused with capital while the money function premises social conditions such as are here indicated by the act m — l which do not at all exist in the mere circulation of commodities and the corresponding circulation of money the purchase and sale of slaves is formally also a purchase and sale of commodities but money cannot perform this function without the existence of slavery if slavery exists then money can be invested in the purchase of slaves on the other hand the mere possession of money cannot make slavery possible in order that the sale of one’s own labourpower in the form of the sale of one’s own labour or in the form of wages may constitute not an isolated phenomenon but a socially decisive premise for the production of commodities in order that moneycapital may therefore perform on a social scale  the abovediscussed function m — clmp historical processes are assumed by which the original connection of the means of production with labourpower was dissolved — processes in consequence of which the mass of the people the labourers have as nonowners come face to face with nonlabourers as the owners of these means of production it makes no difference in this case whether the connection before its dissolution was such in form that the laborer being himself a means of production belonged to the other means of production or whether he was their owner what lies back of m — clmp is distribution not distribution in the ordinary meaning of a distribution of articles of consumption but the distribution of the elements of production itself the material factors of which are concentrated on one side and labourpower isolated on the other the means of production the material part of productive capital must therefore face the laborer as such as capital before the act m — l can become a universal social one we have seen on previous occasions english edition karl marx capital vol i part vii moscow  — ed that in its further development capitalist production once it is established not only reproduces this separation but extends its scope further and further until it becomes the prevailing condition however there is still another side to this question in order that capital may be able to arise and take control of production a definite stage in the development of trade is assumed this applies therefore also to the circulation of commodities and hence to the production of commodities for no articles can enter circulation as commodities unless they are produced for sale hence as commodities but the production of commodities does not become the normal dominant type of production until capitalist production serves as its basis the russian landowners who as a result of the socalled emancipation of the peasants are now compelled to carry on agriculture with the help of wagelabourers instead of the forced labour of serfs complain about two things first about the lack of moneycapital they say for instance that comparatively large sums must be paid to wagelabourers before the crops are sold and just then there is a dearth of ready cash the prime condition capital in the form of money must always be available particularly for the payment of wages before production can be carried on capitalistically but the landowners may take hope everything comes to those who wait and in due time the industrial capitalist will have at his disposal not alone his own money but also that of others the second complaint is more characteristic it is to the effect that even if one has money not enough labourers are to be had at any time the reason is that the russian farmlaborer owing to the common ownership of land in the village community has not yet been fully separated from his means of production and hence is not yet a “free wagelaborer” in the full sense of the word but the existence of the latter on a social scale is a sine qua non for m — c the conversion of money into commodities to be able to represent the transformation of moneycapital into productive capital it is therefore quite clear that the formula for the circuit of moneycapital m — c  c — m is the matterofcourse form of the circuit of capital only on the basis of already developed capitalist production because it presupposes the existence of a class of wagelabourers on a social scale we have seen that capitalist production does not only create commodities and surplusvalue but also reproduces to an ever increasing extent the class of wagelabourers into whom it transforms the vast majority of direct producers since the first condition for its realisation is the permanent existence of a class of wagelabourers m — c  p  c — m presupposes a capital in the form of productive capital and hence the form of the circuit of productive capital ii second stage function of productive capital the circuit of capital which we have here considered begins with the act of circulation m — c the transmutation of money into commodities — purchase circulation must therefore be complemented by the antithetical metamorphosis c — m the transformation of commodities into money — sale but the direct result of m — clmp is the interruption of the circulation of the capitalvalue advanced in the form of money by the transformation of moneycapital into productive capital the capitalvalue has acquired a bodily form in which it cannot continue to circulate but must enter into consumption viz into productive consumption the use of labourpower labour can be materialised only in the labourprocess the capitalist cannot resell the laborer as a commodity because he is not his chattel slave and the capitalist has not bought anything except the right to use his labourpower for a certain time on the other hand the capitalist cannot use this labourpower in any other way than by utilising means of production to create commodities with its help the result of the first stage is therefore entrance into the second the productive stage of capital this movement is represented by m — clmp  p in which the dots indicate that the circulation of capital is interrupted while its circular movement continues since it passes from the sphere of circulation of commodities into that of production the first stage the transformation of moneycapital into productive capital is therefore merely the harbinger and introductory phase of the second stage the functioning of productive capital m — clmp presupposes that the individual performing this act not only has at his disposal values in any useform but also that he has them in the form of money that he is the owner of money but as the act consists precisely in giving away money the individual can remain the owner of money only in so far as the act of giving away implies a return of money but money can return to him only through the sale of commodities hence the above act assumes him to be a producer of commodities m — l the wagelaborer lives only by the sale of his labourpower its preservation — his preservation — requires daily consumption hence payment for it must be continuously repeated at rather short intervals in order that he may be able to repeat acts l — m — c or c — m — c repeat the purchases needed for his selfpreservation for this reason the capitalist must always meet the wagelaborer in the capacity of a moneycapitalist and his capital as moneycapital on the other hand if the wagelabourers the mass of direct producers are to perform the act l — m — c they must constantly be faced with the necessary means of subsistence in purchasable form ie in the form of commodities this state of affairs necessitates a high degree of development of the circulation of products in the form of commodities hence also of the volume of commodities produced when production by means of wagelabour becomes universal commodity production is bound to be the general form of production this mode of production once it is assumed to be general carries in its wake an ever increasing division of social labour that is to say an ever growing differentiation of the articles which are produced in the form of commodities by a definite capitalist ever greater division of complementary processes of production into independent processes m — mp therefore develops to the same extent as m — l does that is to say the production of means of production is divorced to that extent from the production of commodities whose means of production they are and the latter then stand opposed to every producer of commodities which he does not produce but buys for his particular process of production they come from branches of production which operated independently are entirely divorced from his own enter into his own branch as commodities and must therefore be bought the material conditions of commodity production face him more and more as products of other commodity producers as commodities and to the same extent the capitalist must assume the role of moneycapitalist in other words there is an increase in the scale on which his capital must assume the functions of moneycapital on the other hand the same conditions which give rise to the basic condition of capitalist production the existence of a class of wageworkers facilitate the transition of all commodity production to capitalist commodity production as capitalist production develops it has a disintegrating resolvent effect on all older forms of production which designed mostly to meet the direct needs of the producer transform only the excess produced into commodities capitalist production makes the sale of products the main interest at first apparently without affecting the mode of production itself such was for instance the first effect of capitalist world commerce on such nations as the chinese indians arabs etc but secondly wherever it takes root capitalist production destroys all forms of commodity production which are based either on the selfemployment of the producers or merely on the sale of the excess product as commodities capitalist production first makes the production of commodities general and then by degrees transforms all commodity production into capitalist commodity production  whatever the social form of production labourers and means of production always remain factors of it but in a state of separation from each other either of these factors can be such only potentially for production to go on at all they must unite the specific manner in which this union is accomplished distinguishes the different economic epochs of the structure of society from one another in the present case the separation of the free worker from his means of production is the startingpoint given and we have seen how and under what conditions these two elements are united in the hands of the capitalist namely as the productive mode of existence of his capital the actual process which the personal and material creators of commodities enter upon when thus brought together the process of production becomes therefore itself a function of capital the capitalist process of production the nature of which has been fully analysed in the first book of this work every enterprise engaged in commodity production becomes at the same time an enterprise exploiting labourpower but only the capitalist production of commodities has become an epochmaking mode of exploitation which in the course of its historical development revolutionises through the organisation of the labourprocess and the enormous improvement of technique the entire structure of society in a manner eclipsing all former epochs the means of production and labourpower in so far as they are forms of existence of advanced capitalvalue are distinguished by the different roles assumed by them during the process of production in the creation of value hence also of surplusvalue into constant and variable capital being different components of productive capital they are furthermore distinguished by the fact that the means of production in the possession of the capitalist remain his capital even outside of the process of production while labourpower becomes the form of existence of an individual capital only within this process whereas labourpower is a commodity only in the hands of its seller the wagelabourer it becomes capital only in the hands of its buyer the capitalist who acquires the temporary use of it the means of production do not become the material forms of productive capital or productive capital until labourpower the personal form of existence of productive capital is capable of being embodied in them human labourpower is by nature no more capital than by means of production they acquire this specific social character only under definite historically developed conditions just as only under such conditions the character of money is stamped upon precious metals or that of moneycapital upon money productive capital in performing its functions consumes its own component parts for the purpose of transforming them into a mass of products of a higher value since labourpower acts merely as one of its organs the excess of the product’s value engendered by its surpluslabour over and above the value of productive capital’s constituent elements is also the fruit of capital the surpluslabour of labourpower is the gratuitous labour performed for capital and thus forms surplusvalue for the capitalist a value which costs him no equivalent return the product is therefore not only a commodity but a commodity pregnant with surplusvalue its value is equal to p  s that is to say equal to the value of the productive capital p consumed in the production of the commodity plus the surplus values created by it let us assume that this commodity consists of  lbs of yarn and that means of production worth £ and labour power worth £ were consumed in the fabrication of this quantity of yarn during the process of spinning the spinners transmitted to the yarn the value of the means of production consumed by their labour amounting to £ and at the same time they created in proportion with the labourpower expended by them new value to the amount of say £ the  lbs of yarn therefore represent a value of £ iii third stage c — m commodities become commoditycapital as a functional form of existence — stemming directly from the process of production itself — of capitalvalue which has already produced surplusvalue if the production of commodities were carried on capitalistically throughout society all commodities would be elements of commoditycapital from the outset whether they were crude iron brussels lace sulphuric acid or cigars the problem of what kinds of commodities is one of the selfcreated lovely ills of scholastic political economy capital in the form of commodities has to perform the function of commodities the articles of which capital is composed are produced especially for the market and must be sold transformed into money hence go through the process c — m suppose the commodity of the capitalist to consist of  lbs of cotton yarn if £ represent the value of the means of production consumed in the spinning process and new value to the amount of £ has been created the yarn has a value of £ which is expressed in its price of the same amount suppose further that this price is realised by the sale c — m what is it that makes of this simple act of all commodity circulation at the same time a capitalfunction no change that takes place inside of it neither in the usecharacter of the commodity — for it passes into the hands of the buyer as an object of use — nor in its value for this value has not experienced any change of magnitude but only of form it first existed in the form of yarn while now it exists in the form of money thus a substantial distinction is evident between the first stage m — c and the last stage c — m there the advanced money functions as moneycapital because it is transformed by means of the circulation into commodities of a specific usevalue here the commodities can serve as capital only to the extent that they bring this character with them in ready shape from the process of production before their circulation begins during the spinning process the spinners create yarn value to the amount of £ of this sum say £ represent to the capitalist merely an equivalent for his outlay for labourpower while £ — when the degree of exploitation of labourpower is  per cent — form surplusvalue the value of the  lbs of yarn therefore embodies first the value of the consumed productive capital p the constant part of which amounts to £ and the variable to £ their sum being £ equal to  lbs of yarn now the value of the productive capital p is equal to c the value of its constituent elements which in the stage m — c confronted the capitalist as commodities in the hands of their sellers in the second place however the value of the yarn contains a surplusvalue of £ equal to  lbs of yarn c as an expression of the value of the  lbs of yarn is therefore equal to c plus dc or c plus an increment of c equal to £ which we shall call c since it exists in the same commodityform as now the original value c the value of the  lbs of yarn equal to £ is therefore represented by c  c  c what turns c the expression of the value of  lbs of yarn into c is not the absolute magnitude of its value £ for that is determined as in the case of any other c standing for the expression of the value of some other sum of commodities by the quantity of labour embodied in it it is its relative valuemagnitude its valuemagnitude as compared with that of capital p consumed in its production this value is contained in it plus the surplusvalue supplied by the productive capital its value is greater exceeds that of the capitalvalue by this surplusvalue c the  lbs of yarn are the bearers of the capitalvalue expanded enriched by this surplusvalue and they are so by virtue of being the product of the capitalist process of production c expresses a valuerelation the relation of the value of the commodities produced to that of the capital spent on their production in other words expresses the fact that its value is composed of capitalvalue and surplusvalue the  lbs of yarn represent commodity capital c only because they are a converted form of the productive capital p hence in a connection which exists originally only in the circuit of this individual capital or only for the capitalist who produced the yarn with the help of his capital it is so to say only an internal not an external relation that turns the  lbs of yarn in their capacity of vehicles of value into a commoditycapital they exhibit their capitalist birthmark not in the absolute magnitude of their value but in its relative magnitude in the magnitude of their value as compared with that possessed by the productive capital embodied in them before it was transformed into commodities if then these  lbs of yarn are sold at their value of £ this act of circulation considered by itself is identical with c — m a mere transformation of an unchanging value from the form of a commodity into that of money but as a special stage in the circuit of an individual capital the same act is a realisation of the capitalvalue embodied in the commodity to the amount of £ plus the surplusvalue likewise embodied in it of £ that is to say it represents c — m the transformation of the commoditycapital from its commodityform into the money form  the function of c is now that of all commodities viz to transform itself into money to be sold to go through the circulation stage c — m so long as the capital now expanded remains in the form of commoditycapital lies immovable in the market the process of production is at rest the commoditycapital acts neither as a creator of products nor as a creator of value a given capitalvalue will serve in widely different degrees as a creator of products and value and the scale of reproduction will be extended or reduced commensurate with the particular speed with which that capital throws off its commodityform and assumes that of money or with the rapidity of the sale it was shown in book i that the degree of efficiency of any given capital is conditional on the potentialities of the productive process which to a certain extent are independent of the magnitude of its own value english edition karl marx capital vol i pp  — ed here it appears that the process of circulation sets in motion new forces independent of the capital’s magnitude of value and determining its degree of efficiency its expansion and contraction the mass of commodities c being the depository of the expanded capital must furthermore pass in its entirety through the metamorphosis c — m the quantity sold is here a main determinant the individual commodity figures only as an integral part of the total mass the £ worth of value exists in the  lbs of yarn if the capitalist succeeds in selling only  lbs at their value of £ he has replaced only the value of his constant capital the value of the expanded means of production if he sells  lbs he recovers only the value of the total capital advanced he must sell more in order to realise some surplusvalue and he must sell the entire  lbs in order to realise the surplusvalue of £  lbs of yarn in £ in money he receives merely an equivalent for the commodity sold his transaction within the circulation is simply c — m if he had paid his labourers £ in wages instead of £ his surplusvalue would only be £ instead of £ and the degree of exploitation would have been only  per cent instead of  but the value of the yarn would not change only the relation between its component parts would be different the circulation act c — m would still represent the sale of  lbs of yarn for £ their value c is equal to c  c or £ at £ c equals the value of p the productive capital and this equals the value of m the money advanced in m — c the purchase of the elements of production amounting to £ in our example if the mass of commodities is sold at its value then c equals £ and c equals £ the value of the surplusproduct of  lbs of yarn if we call c expressed in money m then c — m  c  c  m  m and the circuit m — c  p  c — m in its expanded form is therefore represented by m — clmp  p  c  c  m  m in the first stage the capitalist takes articles of consumption out of the commoditymarket proper and the labourmarket in the third stage he throws commodities back but only into one market the commoditymarket proper however the fact that he extracts from the market by means of his commodities a greater value than he threw upon it originally is due only to the circumstance that he throws more commodityvalue back upon it than he first drew out of it he threw value m upon it and drew out of it the equivalent c he throws c  c back upon it and draws out of it the equivalent m  m m was in our example equal to the value of  lbs of yarn but he throws  lbs of yarn on the market consequently he returns a greater value than he took from it on the other hand he threw this increased value on the market only because through the exploitation of labourpower in the process of production he had created surplusvalue as an aliquot part of the product expressed in surplusproduct it is only by virtue of being the product of this process that the mass of commodities becomes commoditycapital the bearer of the expanded capitalvalue by performing c — m the advanced capitalvalue as well as the surplusvalue are realised the realisation of both takes place simultaneously in a series of sales or in a lump sale of the entire mass of commodities which is expressed by c — m but the same circulation act c — m is different for capitalvalue and surplusvalue as it expresses for each of them a different stage of their circulation a different section of the series of metamorphoses through which they must pass in the sphere of circulation the surplusvalue c came into the world only during the process of production it appeared for the first time in the commoditymarket in the form of commodities this is its first form of circulation hence the act c — m is its first circulation act or its first metamorphosis which remains to be supplemented by the antithetical act of circulation or the reverse metamorphosis m — c  it is different with the circulation which the capitalvalue c performs in the same circulation act c — m and which constitutes for the circulation act c — m in which c is equal to p equal to the m originally advanced capitalvalue has opened its first circulation act in the form of m moneycapital and returns through the act c — m to the same form it has therefore passed through the two antithetical stages of circulation first m — c second c — m and finds itself once more in the form in which it can begin its circular movement anew what for surplusvalue constitutes the first transformation of the commodityform into that of money constitutes for capitalvalue in return or retransformation into its original moneyform by means of m — clmp money capital is transformed into an equivalent mass of commodities l and mp these commodities no longer perform the function of commodities of articles for sale their value is now in the hands of the capitalist who bought them they represent the value of his productive capital p and in the function of p productive consumption they are transformed into a kind of commodity differing materially from the means of production into yarn in which their value is not only preserved but increased from £ to £ by means of this real metamorphosis the commodities taken from the market in the first stage m — c are replaced by commodities of different substance and value which now must perform the function of commodities must be transformed into money and sold the process of production therefore appears to be only an interruption of the process of circulation of capitalvalue of which up to that point only the first phase m — c has been passed through it passes through the second and concluding phase c — m after c has been altered in substance and value but so far as capitalvalue considered by itself is concerned it has merely suffered an alteration of its useform in the process of production it existed in the form of £ worth of l and mp while now it exists in the form of £ worth of or  lbs of yarn if we therefore consider merely the two circulation phases of capitalvalue apart from its surplusvalue we find that it passes through  m — c and  c — m in which the second c has a different useform but the same value as the first c hence it passes through m — c — m a form of circulation which because the commodity here changes place twice and in the opposite direction — transformation from money into commodities and from commodities into money — necessitates the return of the value advanced in the form of money to its moneyform — its reconversion into money the same circulation act c — m that constitutes the second and concluding metamorphosis a return to the moneyform for the capitalvalue advanced in money represents for the surplusvalue — borne along by the commoditycapital and simultaneously realised by its change into the moneyform — its first metamorphosis its transformation from the commodity to the moneyform c — m its first circulation phase we have then two kinds of observations to make here first the ultimate reconversion of capitalvalue into its original moneyform is a function of commoditycapital secondly this function includes the first transformation of surplusvalue from its original commodityform to its moneyform the moneyform then plays a double role here on the one hand it is the form to which a value originally advanced in money returns hence a return to the form of value which opened the process on the other hand it is the first converted form of a value which originally enters the circulation in commodityform if the commodities composing the commoditycapital are sold at their values as we assume then c plus c is transformed into m plus m its equivalent the realised commoditycapital now exists in the hands of the capitalist in this form m plus m £ plus £  £ capitalvalue and surplusvalue are now present in the form of money the form of the universal equivalent at the conclusion of the process capitalvalue has therefore resumed the form in which it entered it and as moneycapital can now open and go through a new process just because the initial and final forms of this process are those of moneycapital m we call this form of the circulation process the circuit of moneycapital it is not the form but merely the magnitude of the advanced value that is changed at the close m plus m is nothing but a sum of money of a definite magnitude in this case £ but as a result of the circulation of capital as realised commoditycapital this sum of money contains the capitalvalue and the surplusvalue and these values are now no longer inseparably united as they were in the yarn they now lie side by side their sale has given both of them an independent moneyform  of this money represent the capitalvalue of £ and  constitute the surplusvalue of £ this separation effected by the realisation of the commoditycapital has not only the formal content to which we shall refer presently it becomes important in the process of the reproduction of capital depending on whether m is entirely or partially or not at all lumped together with m ie depending on whether or not it continues to function as a component part of the advanced capitalvalue both m and m may pass through quite different processes of circulation in m capital has returned to its original form m to its moneyform a form however in which it is materialised as capital there is in the first place a difference of quantity it was m £ it is now m £ and this difference is expressed by m  m the quantitatively different extremes of the circuit whose movement is indicated only by the three dots m  m and m  m  s the surplusvalue but as a result of this circular movement m  m it is only m which exists now it is the product in which its process of formation has become extinct m now exists by itself independently of the movement which brought it into existence that movement is gone m is there in its place but m being m plus m £ composed of £ advanced capital plus an increment of the same amounting to £ represents at the same time a qualitative relation although this qualitative relation itself exists only as a relation between the parts of one and the same sum hence as a quantitative relation m the advanced capital which is now once more present in its original form £ exists as realised capital it has not only preserved itself but also realised itself as capital by being distinguished as such from m £ to which it stands in the same relation as to an increase of its own to a fruit of its own to an increment to which it has given birth itself it has been realised as capital because it has been realised as a value which has created value m exists as a capitalrelation m no longer appears as mere money but expressly plays the part of moneycapital expressed as a selfexpanded value hence possessing the property of selfexpansion of hatching a higher value than it itself has m became capital by virtue of its relation to the other part of m which it has brought about which has been effected by it as the cause which is the consequence of it as the ground thus m appears as the sum of values differentiated within itself functionally conceptually distinguished within itself expressing the capitalrelation but this is expressed only as a result without the intervention of the process of which it is the result parts of value as such are not qualitatively different from one another except in so far as they appear as values of different articles of concrete things hence in various useforms and therefore as values of different commodities — a difference which does not originate with them themselves as mere parts of value in money all differences between commodities are extinguished because it is the equivalent form common to all of them a sum of money in the amount of £ consists solely of uniform elements of £ each since the intermediate links of its origin are obliterated in the simple existence of this sum of money and every trace has been lost of the specific difference between the different component parts of capital in the process of production there exists now only the distinction between the conceptual form of a principal equal to £ the capital advanced and an excess value of £ let m be equal to say £ of which £ may be equal to m the principal and  equal to s the surplusvalue there is an absolute homogeneity an absence of conceptual distinctions between the two constituent parts of the sum of £ any £ of this sum always constitute  of the total sum of £ whether they are  of the advanced principal of £ or the excess of £ above it principal and excess sum capital and surplussum may therefore be expressed as fractional parts of the total sum in our illustration  form the principal or the capital and  the surplus sum in its moneyexpression realised capital appears therefore at the end of its process as an irrational expression of the capitalrelation true this applies also to c c plus c but there is this difference that c of which c and c are only proportional valueparts of the same homogeneous mass of commodities indicates its origin p whose immediate product it is while in m a form derived directly from circulation the direct relation to p is obliterated the irrational distinction between the principal and the incremental sum which is contained in m so far as that expresses the result of the movement m  m disappears as soon as it once more functions actively as moneycapital and is therefore not fixed as a moneyexpression of expanded industrial capital the circuit of capital can never begin with m although m now performs the function of m it can begin only with m that is to say it can never begin as an expression of the capitalrelation but only as a form of advance of capitalvalue as soon as the £ are once more advanced as capital in order again to produce s they constitute a point of departure not one of return instead of a capital of £ a capital of £ is now advanced it is more money than before more capitalvalue but the relation between its two constituent parts has disappeared in fact a sum of £ instead of the £ might originally have served as capital it is not an active function of moneycapital to appear as m to appear as m is rather a function of c even in the simple circulation of commodities first in c — m secondly in m — c money m does not figure actively until the second act m — c its appearance in the form of m is only the result of the first act by virtue of which it only then appears as a converted form of c true the capitalrelation contained in m the relation of one of its parts as the capitalvalue to the other as its value increment acquires functional importance in so far as with the constantly repeated circuit m  m m splits into two circulations one of them a circulation of capital the other of surplusvalue consequently these two parts perform not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different functions m others than m but considered by itself the form m  m does not include what the capitalist consumes but explicitly only the selfexpansion and accumulation so far as the latter expresses itself above all as a periodical augmentation of ever renewed advances of moneycapital although m equal to m plus m is the irrational form of capital it is at the same time only moneycapital in its realised form in the form of money which has generated money but this is different from the function of moneycapital in the first stage m — clmp in the first stage m circulates as money it assumes the functions of moneycapital because only in its money state can it perform a moneyfunction can it transform itself into the elements of p into l and mp which stand opposed to it as commodities in this circulation act it functions only as money but as this act is the first stage of capitalvalue in process it is simultaneously a function of moneycapital by virtue of the specific useform of the commodities l and mp which are bought m on the other hand composed of m the capitalvalue and m the surplusvalue begotten of m stands for selfexpanded capitalvalue — the purpose and the outcome the function of the total circuit of capital the fact that it expresses this outcome in the form of money as realised moneycapital does not derive from its being the moneyform of capital moneycapital but on the contrary from its being moneycapital capital in the form of money from capital having opened the process in this form from its having been advanced in the moneyform its reconversion into the moneyform is as we have seen a function of commoditycapital c not of moneycapital as for the difference between m and m it m is simply the moneyform of c the increment of c m is composed of m plus m only because c was composed of c plus c in c therefore this difference and the relation of the capitalvalue to the surplusvalue generated by it is present and expressed before both of them are transformed into m into a sum of money in which both parts of the value come face to face with each other independently and may therefore be employed in separate and distinct functions m is only the result of the realisation of c both m and c are merely different forms of selfexpanded capitalvalue one of them the commodityform the other the moneyform both of them have this in common that they are selfexpanded capitalvalue both of them are materialised capital because capitalvalue as such exists here together with the surplusvalue the fruit obtained through it and differing from it although this relation is expressed only in the irrational form of the relation between two parts of a sum of money or of a commodityvalue but as expressions of capital in relation and contradistinction to the surplusvalue produced by it hence as expressions of selfexpanded value m and c are the same and express the same thing only in different forms they do not differ as moneycapital and commoditycapital but as money and commodities in so far as they represent selfexpanded value capital acting as capital they only express the result of the functioning of productive capital the only function in which capitalvalue generates value what they have in common is that both of them moneycapital as well as commoditycapital are modes of existence of capital the one is capital in moneyform the other in commodityform the specific functions that distinguish them cannot therefore be anything else but differences between the functions of money and of commodities commoditycapital the direct product of the capitalist process of production is reminiscent of its origin and is therefore more rational and less incomprehensible in form than moneycapital in which every trace of this process has vanished as in general all special useforms of commodities disappear in money it is therefore only when m itself functions as commoditycapital when it is the direct product of a productive process instead of being the converted form of this product that it loses its bizarre form that is to say in the production of the money material itself in the production of gold for instance the formula would be m — clmp  p  m m plus m where m would figure as a commodity product because p furnishes more gold than was advanced for the elements of production of the gold in the first m the moneycapital in this case the irrational nature of the expression m  m m plus m disappears here a part of a sum of money appears as the mother of another part of the same sum of money iv the circuit as a whole we have seen that the process of circulation is interrupted at the end of its first phase m — clmp by p in which the commodities l and mp bought in the market are consumed as the material and value components of productive capital the product of this consumption is a new commodity c altered in respect of substance and value the interrupted process of circulation m — c must be completed by c — m but the bearer of this second and concluding phase of circulation is c a commodity different in substance and value from the original c the circulation series therefore appears as  m — c  c — m where in the second phase of the first commodity c another commodity of greater value and different useform c is substituted during the interruption caused by the functioning of p the production of c from the elements of c the forms of existence of productive capital p however the first form of appearance in which capital faced us buch i kap iv  english edition ch iv — ed viz m — c — m extended  m — c  c — m shows the same commodity twice both times it is the same commodity into which money is transformed in the first phase and reconverted into more money in the second phase in spite of this essential difference both circulations share this much that in their first phase money is transformed into commodities and in the second commodities into money that the money spent in the first phase returns in the second on the one hand both have in common this reflux of the money to its startingpoint on the other hand also the excess of the returning money over the money advanced to that extent the formula m — c  c — m is contained in the general formula m — c — m it follows furthermore that each time equally great quantities of simultaneously existing values face and replace each other in the two metamorphoses m — c and c — m belonging in circulation the change in value pertains exclusively to the metamorphosis p the process of production which thus appears as a real metamorphosis of capital as compared with the merely metamorphosis of circulation let us now consider the total movement m — c  p  c — m or m — clmp  p  c c  c — m m  m its more expanded form capital here appears as a value which goes through a series of interconnected interdependent transformations a series of metamorphoses which form just as many phases or stages of the process as a whole two of these phases belong in the sphere of circulation one of them in that of production in each one of these phases capitalvalue has a different form for which there is a correspondingly different special function within this movement the advanced value does not only preserve itself but grows increases in magnitude finally in the concluding stage it returns to the same form which it had at the beginning of the process as a whole this process as a whole constitutes therefore the process of moving in circuits the two forms assumed by capitalvalue at the various stages of its circulation are those of moneycapital and commoditycapital the form pertaining to the stage of production is that of productive capital the capital which assumes these forms in the course of its total circuit and then discards them and in each of them performs the function corresponding to the particular form is industrial capital industrial here in the sense it comprises every branch of industry run on a capitalist basis moneycapital commoditycapital and productive capital do not therefore designate independent kinds of capital whose functions form the content of likewise independent branches of industry separated from one another they denote here only special functional forms of industrial capital which assumes all three of them one after the other capital describes its circuit normally only so long as its various phases pass uninterruptedly into one another if capital stops short in the first phase m — c moneycapital assumes the rigid form of a hoard if it stops in the phase of production the means of production lie without functioning on the one side while labourpower remains unemployed on the other and if capital stops short in the last phase c — m piles of unsold commodities accumulate and clog the flow of circulation however it is in the nature of things that the circuit itself necessitates the fixation of capital for certain lengths of time in its various phases in each of its phases industrial capital is tied up with a definite form moneycapital productive capital commoditycapital it does not acquire the form in which it may enter a new transformation phase until it has performed the function corresponding to each particular form to make this plain we have assumed in our illustration that the capitalvalue of the quantity of commodities created at the stage of production is equal to the total sum of the value originally advanced in the form of money or in other words that the entire capitalvalue advanced in the form of money passes on in bulk from one stage to the next but we have seen buch i kap vi english edition ch viii — ed that a part of constant capital the labour instruments proper eg machinery continually serve anew with more or less numerous repetitions of the same process of production hence transfer their values piecemeal to the products it will be seen later to what extent this circumstance modifies the circular movement of capital for the present the following suffices in our illustration the value of productive capital amounting to £ contained only the average wear and tear of factory buildings machinery etc that is to say only that part of value which they transferred to the yarn in the transformation of  lbs of cotton into  lbs of yarn which represented the product of one week’s spinning of  hours in the means of production into which the advanced constant capital of £ was transformed the instruments of labour buildings machinery etc figured as if they had only been rented in the market at a weekly rate but this does not change the gist of the matter in any way we have but to multiply the quantity of yarn produced in one week ie  lbs of yarn by the number of weeks contained in a certain number of years in order to transfer to the yarn the entire value of the instruments of labour bought and consumed during this period it is then plain that the advanced moneycapital must first be transformed into these instruments hence must have gone through the first phase m — c before it can function as productive capital p and it is likewise plain in our illustration that the capital value of £ embodied in the yarn during the process of production cannot be part of the value of the  lbs of yarn and enter the circulation phase c — m until it is ready it cannot be sold until it has been spun in the general formula the product p is regarded as a material thing different from the elements of the productive capital as an object existing apart from the process of production and having a useform different from that of the elements of production this is always the case when the result of the productive process assumes the form of a thing even when a part of the product reenters the resumed production as one of its elements grain for instance serves as seed for its own production but the product consists only of grain and hence has a shape different from those of related elements such as labourpower implements fertiliser but there are certain independent branches of industry in which the product of the productive process is not a new material product is not a commodity among these only the communications industry whether engaged in transportation proper of goods and passengers or in the mere transmission of communications letters telegrams etc is economically important a chuprov  says on this score “the manufacturer may first produce articles and then look for consumers” his product thrust out of the process of production when finished passes into circulation as a commodity separated from it “production and consumption thus appear as two acts separated in space and time in the transportation industry which does not create any new products but merely transfer men and things these two acts coincide its services” change of place “are consumed the moment they are produced for this reason the area within which railways can sell their services extends at best  versts  kilometres on either side of their tracks” the result whether men or goods are transported is a change in their whereabouts yarn for instance may now be in india instead of in england where it was produced however what the transportation industry sells is change of location the useful effect is inseparably connected with the process of transportation ie the productive process of the transport industry men and goods travel together with the means of transportation and their traveling this locomotion constitutes the process of production effected by these means the useful effect can be consumed only during this process of production it does not exist as a utility different from this process a usething which does not function as an article of commerce does not circulate as a commodity until after it has been produced but the exchangevalue of this useful effect is determined like that of any other commodity by the value of the elements of production labourpower and means of production consumed in it plus the surplusvalue created by the surpluslabour of the labourers employed in transportation this useful effect also entertains the very same relations to consumption that other commodities do if it is consumed individually its value disappears during its consumption if it is consumed productively so as to constitute by itself a stage in the production of the commodities being transported its value is transferred as an additional value to the commodity itself the formula for the transport industry would therefore be m — clmp  p — m since it is the process of production itself that is paid for and consumed not a product separate and distinct from it hence this formula has almost the same form as that of the production of precious metals the only difference being that in this case m represents the converted form of the useful effect created during the process of production and not the bodily form of the gold or silver produced in this process and extruded from it industrial capital is the only mode of existence of capital in which not only the appropriation of surplusvalue or surplusproduct but simultaneously its creation is a function of capital therefore with it the capitalist character of production is a necessity its existence implies the class antagonism between capitalists and wagelabourers to the extent that it seizes control of social production the technique and social organisation of the labourprocess are revolutionised and with them the economicohistorical type of society the other kinds of capital which appeared before industrial capital amid conditions of social production that have receded into the past or are now succumbing are not only subordinated to it and the mechanism of their functions altered in conformity with it but move solely with it as their basis hence live and die stand and fall with this basis moneycapital and commoditycapital so far as they function as vehicles of particular branches of business side by side with industrial capital are nothing but modes of existence of the different functional forms now assumed now discarded by industrial capital in the sphere of circulation — modes which due to social division of labour have attained independent existence and been developed onesidedly the circuit m  m on the one hand intermingles with the general circulation of commodities proceeds from it and flows back into it is a part of it on the other hand it forms an independent movement of the capitalvalue for the individual capitalist a movement of its own which takes place partly within the general circulation of commodities partly outside of it but which always preserves its independent character first because its two phases that take place in the sphere of circulation m — c and c — m being phases of the movement of capital have functionally definite characters in m — c c is materially determined as labourpower and means of production in c — m the capitalvalue is realised plus the surplusvalue secondly because p the process of production embraces productive consumption thirdly because the return of the money to its startingpoint makes of the movement m  m a circuit complete in itself every individual capital is therefore on the one hand in its two circulationhalves m — c and c — m an agent of the general circulation of commodities in which it either functions or lies concatenated as money or as a commodity thus forming a link in the general chain of metamorphoses taking place in the world of commodities on the other hand it describes within the general circulation its own independent circuit in which the sphere of production forms a transitional stage and in which this capital returns to its startingpoint in the same form in which it left that point within its own circuit which includes its real metamorphosis in the process of production it changes at the same time the magnitude of its value it returns not simply as moneyvalue but as augmented increased moneyvalue let us finally consider m — c  p  c — m as a special form of the circular course of capital alongside the other forms which we shall analyse later we shall find that it is distinguished by the following features  it appears as the circuit of moneycapital because industrial capital in its moneyform as moneycapital forms the startingpoint and the point of return of its total process the formula itself expresses the fact that the money is not expended here as money but is merely advanced hence is merely the moneyform of capital moneycapital it expresses furthermore that exchangevalue not usevalue is the determining aim of this movement just because the moneyform of value is the independent tangible form in which value appears the form of circulation m  m the initial and terminal points of which are real money expresses most graphically the compelling motive of capitalist production — moneymaking the process of production appears merely as an unavoidable intermediate link as a necessary evil for the sake of moneymaking all nations with a capitalist mode of production are therefore seized periodically by a feverish attempt to make money without the intervention of the process of production  the stage of production the function of p represents in this circuit an interruption between the two phases of circulation m — c  c — m which in its turn represents only the intermediate link in the simple circulation m — c — m the process of production appears in the form of a circuitdescribing process formally and explicitly as that which it is in the capitalist mode of production as a mere means of expanding the advanced value hence enrichment as such as the purpose of production  since the series of phases is opened by m — c the second link of the circulation is c — m in other words the startingpoint is m the moneycapital that is to be selfexpanded the terminal point is m the selfexpanded moneycapital m plus m in which m figures as realised capital along with its offspring m this distinguishes the circuit of m from that of the two other circuits p and c and does so in two ways on the one hand by the moneyform of the two extremes and money is the independent tangible form of existence of value the value of the product in its independent valueform in which every trace of the usevalue of the commodities has been extinguished on the other hand the form p  p does not necessarily become p  p p plus p and in the form c  c no difference whatever in value is visible between the two extremes it is therefore characteristic of the formula m — m that for one thing capitalvalue is its startingpoint and expanded capitalvalue its point of return so that the advance of capitalvalue appears as the means and expanded capitalvalue as the end of the entire operation and that for another thing this relation is expressed in moneyform in the independent valueform hence moneycapital as money begetting money the generation of surplusvalue by value is not only expressed as the alpha and omega of the process but explicitly in the form of glittering money  since m the moneycapital realised as a result of c — m the complementary and concluding phase of m — c has absolutely the same form as that in which it began its first circuit it can as soon as it emerges from the latter begin the same circuit over again as an increased accumulated moneycapital m  m  m and at least it is not expressed in the form m  m that in the repetition of the circuit the circulation of m separates from that of m considered in its onetime form formally the circuit of moneycapital expresses therefore simply the process of selfexpansion and of accumulation consumption is expressed in it only as productive consumption by m — clmp and it is only this consumption that is included in this circuit of individual capital m — l is l — m or c — m on the part of the labourer it is therefore the first phase of circulation which brings about his individual consumption thus l — m — c means of subsistence the second phase m — c no longer falls within the circuit of individual capital but is initiated and premised by it since the labourer must above all live hence maintain himself by individual consumption in order to always be in the market as material that the capitalist can exploit but this consumption itself is here only assumed as a condition for the productive consumption of labourpower by capital hence only to the extent that the worker maintains and reproduces himself as labourpower by means of his individual consumption however the mp the commodities proper which enter into the circuit of capital are nutriment for the productive consumption only the act l — m promotes the individual consumption of the labourer the transformation of the means of subsistence into his flesh and blood true the capitalist must also be there must also live and consume to be able to perform the function of a capitalist to this end he has indeed to consume only as much as the labourer and that is all this form of the circulation process presupposes but even this is not formally expressed since the formula concludes with m ie a result which can at once resume its function as moneycapital now augmented c — m directly contains the sale of c but c — m a sale on the one part is m — c a purchase on the other part and in the last analysis a commodity is bought only for its usevalue in order to enter leaving intermediate sales out of consideration the process of consumption whether this is individual or productive according to the nature of the article bought but this consumption does not enter the circuit of individual capital the product of which is c this product is eliminated from the circuit precisely because it is a commodity for sale c is expressly designed for consumption by others than the producer thus we find that certain exponents of the mercantile system which is based on the formula m — c  p  c — m deliver lengthy sermons to the effect that the individual capitalist should consume only as much as the labourer that the nation of capitalists should leave the consumption of their own commodities and the consumption process in general to the other less intelligent nations but that they themselves should make productive consumption their life’s task these sermons frequently remind one in form and content of analogous ascetic expostulations of the fathers of the church capital’s movement in circuits is therefore the unity of circulation and production it includes both since the two phases m — c and c — m are acts of circulation the circulation of capital is a part of the general circulation of commodities but as functionally they are definite sections stages in capital’s circuit which pertains not only to the sphere of circulation but also to that of production capital goes through its own circuit in the general circulation of commodities the general circulation of commodities serves capital in the first stage as a means of assuming that shape in which it can perform the function of productive capital in the second stage it serves to strip off the commodityfunction in which capital cannot renew its circuit at the same time it opens up to capital the possibility of separating its own circuit from the circulation of the surplusvalue that accrued to it the circuit made by moneycapital is therefore the most onesided and thus the most striking and typical form in which the circuit of industrial capital appears the capital whose aim and compelling motive — the selfexpansion of value the making of money and accumulation — is thus conspicuously revealed buying to sell dearer owing to the fact that the first phase is m — c it is also revealed that the constituents of productive capital originate in the commoditymarket and in general that the capitalist process of production depends on circulation on commerce the circuit of moneycapital is not merely the production of commodities it is itself possible only through circulation and presupposes it this is plain if only from the fact that the form m belonging in circulation appears as the first and pure form of advanced capitalvalue which is not the case in the other two circuit forms the moneycapital circuit always remains the general expression of industrial capital because it always includes the selfexpansion of the advanced value in p  p the moneyexpression of capital appears only as the price of the elements of production hence only as a value expressed in money of account and is fixed in this form in bookkeeping m  m becomes a special form of the industrial capital circuit when newly active capital is first advanced in the form of money and then withdrawn in the same form either in passing from one branch of industry to another or in retiring industrial capital from a business this includes the functioning as capital of the surplusvalue first advanced in the form of money and becomes most evident when surplusvalue functions in some other business than the one in which it originated m  m may be the first circuit of a certain capital it may be the last it may be regarded as the form of the total social capital it is the form of capital that is newly invested either as capital recently accumulated in the form of money or as some old capital which is entirely transformed into money for the purpose of transfer from one branch of industry to another being a form always contained in all circuits moneycapital performs this circuit precisely for that part of capital which produces surplusvalue viz variable capital the normal form of advancing wages is payment in money this process must be renewed in comparatively short intervals because the labourer lives from hand to mouth the capitalist must therefore always confront the labourer as moneycapitalist and his capital as moneycapital there can be no direct or indirect balancing of accounts in this case such as we find in the purchase of means of production and in the sale of produced commodities so that the greater part of the moneycapital actually figures only in the form of commodities money only in the form of money of account and finally in cash only in the balancing of accounts on the other hand a part of the surplusvalue arising out of variable capital is spent by the capitalist for his individual consumption which pertains to the retail trade and however circuitous the route may be this part is always spent in cash in the moneyform of surplusvalue variable capital always appears anew as moneycapital invested in wages m — l and m as surplusvalue to defray the cost of individual consumption of the capitalist hence m advanced variable capitalvalue and m its increment are necessarily held in the form of money to be spent in this form the formula m — c  p  c — m with its result m  m  m is deceptive in form is illusory in character owing to the existence of the advanced and selfexpanded value in its equivalent form money the emphasis is not on the selfexpansion of value but on the moneyform of this process on the fact that more value in moneyform is finally drawn out of the circulation than was originally advanced to it hence on the multiplication of the mass of gold and silver belonging to the capitalist the socalled monetary system is merely an expression of the irrational form m — c — m a movement which takes place exclusively in circulation and therefore can explain the two acts m — c and c — m in no other way than as a sale of c above its value in the second act and therefore as c drawing more money out of the circulation than was put into it by its purchase on the other hand m — c  p  c — m fixed as the exclusive form constitutes the basis of the more highly developed mercantile system in which not only the circulation of commodities but also their production appears as a necessary element the illusory character of m — c  p  c — m and the correspondingly illusory interpretation exists whenever this form is fixed as occurring once not as fluent and ever renewed hence whenever this form is considered not as one of the forms of the circuit but as its exclusive form but it itself points toward other forms in the first place this entire circuit is premised on the capitalist character of the process of production and therefore considers this process together with the specific social conditions brought about by it as the basis m — c  m — clmp but m — l assumes the existence of the wagelabourer and hence the means of production as part of productive capital it assumes therefore that the process of labour and selfexpansion the process of production is a function of capital in the second place if m  m is repeated the return to the moneyform appears just as evanescent as the moneyform in the first stage m — c disappears to make room for p the constantly recurrent advance in the form of money and its constant return in the form of money appear merely as fleeting moments in the circuit in the third place beginning with the second repetition of the circuit the circuit p  c — m m — c  p appears before the second circuit of m is completed and all subsequent circuits may thus be considered under the form of p  c — m — c  p so that m — c being the first phase of the first circuit is merely the passing preparation for the constantly repeated circuit of the productive capital and this indeed is so in the case of industrial capital invested for the first time in the form of moneycapital on the other hand before the second circuit of p is completed the first circuit that of commoditycapital c — mm — c  p  c abridged c  c has already been made thus the first form already contains the other two and the moneyform thus disappears so far as it is not merely an expression of value but an expression of value in the equivalent form in money finally if we consider some newly invested individual capital describing for the first time the circuit m — c  p  c — m then m — c is the preparatory phase the forerunner of the first process of production gone through by this individual capital this phase m — c is consequently not presupposed but rather called for or necessitated by the process of production but this applies only to this individual capital the general form of the circuit of industrial capital is the circuit of moneycapital whenever the capitalist mode of production is taken for granted hence in social conditions determined by capitalist production therefore the capitalist process of production is assumed as a precondition if not in the first circuit of the moneycapital of a newly invested industrial capital then outside of it the continuous existence of this process of production presupposes the constantly renewed circuit p  p even in the first stage m — c this premise plays a part for this assumes on the one hand the existence of the class of wagelabourers and then on the other that which is m — c the first stage for the buyer of means of production is c — m for their seller hence c presupposes commoditycapital and thus the commodities themselves as a result of capitalist production and thereby the function of productive
