challenges multichannel sales organizations selling technical products in a complex sales process face a number of challenges capturing opportunity status from sales internal or in the channel aligning direct and channel sales efforts to the most important pursuits developing and tracking account plans across rd party opportunities collaborating with a channel and coordinating tasks required to close opportunities gaining the visibility needed to produce reliable forecasts that include rd party opportunities synchronizing information flow across disparate channel systems providing visibility to key sales pursuits while protecting the channel’s sensitive account and opportunity information rolling up forecasts from distributors manufacturing reps vars and dealers across the entire organization   herding cats anyone who has ever managed a rd party sales channel knows it’s not easy sharing information and coordinating activities can be a challenge third party sales organizations may need help closing opportunities but they are often reluctant to share their entire account contact and opportunity database instead channel managers and their selling organizations often rely on email to update opportunity status request assistance and supply information without a transparent and seamless way to record and track activities sales cycles get delayed tasks are left undone and opportunities missed furthermore untold hours are spent each month often by expensive selling resources gathering and rolling up forecasts despite problems caused by disparate systems requiring a rd party selling organization to use a standardized customer relationship management crm or sales force automation sfa system is usually not feasible these organizations often work with multiple companies and may follow a different sales methodology mapped to their existing system the cost of an additionalnew system may be prohibitive or they may simply not feel comfortable sharing all of their account information with any single vendor in order to gain the visibility needed to collaborate effectively and produce reliable sales forecasts channel sales organizations need technology that captures opportunity information from rd party sources and synchronizes required actions – without requiring a lot of effort and expense on the part of the channel complete visibility to opportunities growthpoint opportunity tracking allows organizations to share information with rd party sales channels supporting collaborative sales efforts to help close more orders and automatically roll up forecasts the system is tailored to capture the specific information needed to track manage and collaborate on sales pursuits account plans can also be developed and
