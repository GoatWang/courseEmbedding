improving plant traits with teams of microbes directed selection for the discovery of beneficial microbial consortia bioconsortia is developing highly effective microbial consortia for increasing agricultural yields we have developed a revolutionary advanced microbial selection ams process which uses directed selection to discover beneficial teams of microbes this novel patented model works by controlling the seed genetics and the environment while changing the microbial community in order to shift trait performance in the crop toward improved targeted phenotypes   read more what are microbial consortia microbial consortia are elements of diverse communities of bacteria and fungi found naturally throughout the biosphere microbes naturally colonize plants providing beneficial harmful or neutral interactions we identify the best microbial teams that influence the phenotype of the plant our process is a powerful alternative to stacking or mixing individually identified microbes resulting in products with higher efficacy preselected for their ability to colonize a plant together read more read more revolutionary rd platform bioconsortia has developed a proprietary and patented advanced microbial selection ams process using directed selection we select the plant phenotype the plant selects the team the microbes accumulated by plants with superior phenotypes are put through an iterative selection process which shifts the microbial community structure towards the most beneficial team isolated microbial consortia are then developed into a seed treatment drench

products plant traits microbes can influence many crop traits giving phenotypic responses that are also seen through plant breeding the ams process allows for rapid identification of these teams of microbes and can work as an alternative or complement to conventional efforts by breeders and gm traits  bioconsortia is currently researching microbial consortia that deliver trait improvements for enhancing abiotic tolerance the ams process can be tailored to find solutions and improvements to a variety of different plant traits cold and wet tolerance in early season the development of microbial products that reduce early stress in corn is one of our key targets to achieve this we are applying our ams process to select coldtolerant microbes that contribute to rapid and vigorous growth following cold stress and wet conditions salt and drought tolerance drought and salinity tolerance are becoming increasingly important traits for many crops worldwide we have identified product leads that contribute to drought and salinity tolerance in wheat and forage crops further work is currently under way to bring these leads through to field testing biotic resistance the ams process provides an effective means for selection of microbes that confer resilience to root diseases  these products are not a focus of our inhouse research today but are available for further development under collaboration agreements with partners repetitive cropping solutions we believe that microbes can help combat the yield decline typically associated with repetitive cropping practices such as corn following corn this will provide farmers with more options when it comes to maximizing farm productivity and profits enhanced metabolite expression we have demonstrated that we are able to positively impact almost any crop trait with our microbial consortia in a similar way to plant breeding two examples from proofofconcept trials are increased sugar content and improved coloration

eastern standard time davis califbusiness wirebioconsortia inc innovator of microbial solutions for natural plant trait enhancement and crop yield improvement announced that it has raised this year a total of  million for future growth last week bioconsortia closed an  million equity round of investment financed by existing investors khosla ventures and otter capital and earlier in the year raised  million of venture debt from square  bank a division of pacific western bank experienced ag tech investors khosla ventures and otter capital funded bioconsortia’s  million series b round in early  enabling the move from new zealand to the us and establishing operations and headquarters in davis california this move refocused the research on us microbes seed genetics more sustainable fertilizers and improved agronomic practices “we are thrilled with the commitment and support from our existing investors and square  bank this is a busy time of year for all in the ag space with field trial data coming in having funding in place early means that we can keep our foot on the accelerator and continue to expand our research capabilities field trials program and the number of beneficial traits that we are moving down our pipeline” says bioconsortia ceo marcus meadowssmith bioconsortia continues to exploit its revolutionary advanced microbial selection® ams process to discover advantageous microbial consortia treatments for biofertilizers and biostimulants recently the company launched several biopesticide projects to identify crucial microbial solutions to combat seed and soilborne diseases and pests following the addition of dr hong zhu from bayer cropscience earlier this year the company is also further expanding its formulation and fermentation team to work on products that meet the best standards for seed and soilapplied solutions construction on new lab space at the current rd facilities is underway building on  field trials bioconsortia will increase its program for  next year’s trials will include important traits for drought tolerance and fertilizer use efficiency on corn soy and wheat as well as biopesticide trials for management of soilborne diseases in select highvalue vegetable crops and pests such as corn rootworm about us bioconsortia inc is developing effective microbial solutions that enhance plant phenotypes and increase crop yields we are pioneering the use of directed selection in identifying teams of microbes  working like plant breeders and selecting plants based on targeted characteristics then isolating the associated microbial community our proprietary advanced microbial selection® ams process enriches the crop microbiome allowing us to identify organisms that influence the expression of beneficial traits in plants we are currently focused on products for fertilizer use efficiency growth improvement and both abiotic tolerance and biotic resistance as commercial seed treatments liquid infurrow products and granule

accelerate the development sales and marketing of our seed treatment drench and granule products bioconsortia inc is developing highly effective microbial consortia for increasing agricultural yields soil and plant associated microbes interact with and supplement the functions encoded by the crop genome opportunities abound to exploit these plantmicrobe interactions but overwhelming complexity and the huge amount of genetic diversity has hindered the realization of these by conventional rd methods bioconsortia has developed a revolutionary advanced microbial selection ams process for crop trait enhancement that uses iterative rounds of plant phenotyping and selection to coselect for beneficial changes in the microbiome isolates are obtained from the microbiome of plants expressing the desired traits and are developed as consortia for application as commercial seed treatment drench or granule products we have a pipeline of products for increased fertilizer utilization growth

of bacteria and fungi found naturally throughout the biosphere microbes naturally colonize plants providing beneficial harmful or neutral interactions we identify the best microbial teams that influence the phenotype of the plant our process is a powerful alternative to stacking or mixing individually identified microbes resulting in products with higher efficacy preselected for their
