wingstop fly from here  wingstop inc nasdaqwing  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»where does wingstop fly from hereapr   about wingstop inc wing kwanchen ma longshort equity value growth bondsgeorge postsummarysimilar to dunkin’ brands and krispy kreme wingstop has a singleproduct franchise model all three companies have shifted to a more profitable franchiseheavy approachuniquely benefited from fast causal trend social media promotion the rise of millennials and the stay at home economy wingstop has been able to open  storesat the same historical juncture wingstop is fundamentally closer to dunkin’ brands but overvalued closer to krispy kreme which turned into its own demise three years laterwith a pe of  wing is traded today at a level higher than most highflying technology names of the decade source yahoo finance wingstop nasdaq wing is at the same juncture as dunkin brands nasdaq dnkn and krispy kreme kkd were  quarters out of their ipo gates see figure above the comparison is relevant in that all three companies virtually share the same business model yet they also faced different business environments at the time common business model in case you dont know wingstop sells chicken wings dunkin brands and krispy kreme sell doughnuts other than the fact that the majority of their revenue has been generated from a single consumer product they are the only public firms selling that single product krispy kreme went private in   specialization wings a side item and a soft drink make up  of the orders that wingstop fills this heavy specialization in wings makes it easy for the company to communicate its products and menu makeup and keep costs low it also allows the company to compete on the quality of their single product with its business concept being built around selling chicken wings in a fast casual convenient setting wingstop has a competitive advantage over restaurants that have elaborate menus by perfecting only one product  move to a franchiseheavy model for wingstop royalty revenue and franchise fees were  million an increase of  million or  from  royalty revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of franchised restaurants on average the revenue of a typical franchised restaurant is  million and it costs about  to build a new location because of its small size the profit margin for a franchised restaurant is over  which is twice of the overall margin see company ks and qs as a result there were  franchised stores vs  companyowned stores opened in  and  of wingstops stores are franchised similar to dunkin brands and krispy kreme there is an industry trend moving towards a more profitable franchiseheavy model long thesis since its ipo in  wingstop has been able to benefit from the following new business environment which was not available to dunkin brands and krispy kreme at their ipos fastcasual trend the fastcasual concept allows customers to sit down to have a formal dinein experience that higher quality foods can be quickly prepared at a near fastfood cost wingstop provides the alternative for a quick casual and quality meal at a lower cost the average meal cost per person is around  other than fast and casual wingstop is also comfortable for every group their business model is appropriate for people of all ages wingstop offers more familyoriented atmosphere than competitive chains like buffalo wild wings nasdaq bwld wing house or hooters which serve alcohol in a bar or sportscentric setting online ordering since the implementation of wingstops point of sale pos system in  online ordering has increased from less than  to  of sale just in the second half of  over  online orders contributed nearly  of the total sales see company qs millennials wingstops target customer group respond to online ordering the most investments in technology will soon pay off as it attracts millennial stay home and chill the term chill factor refers to a trend we see people looking for convenience saving time and low cost the chill factor creates a new stay home economy of which wingstop is a direct benefactor when people decide to stay home and chill with friends they usually do not pick up burgers or donuts more than  of wingstops revenue is from takeout orders furthermore wingstop was the first restaurant to successfully launch dynamic social ordering on facebook messenger and twitter see company qs short thesis that being said a good product is not necessarily a good company a good company is not necessarily a good stock it may be fruitful to compare three very similar companies and their stocks at the same point of their product life cycles as our interest is wingstop and it is at the point  quarters after its ipo the time  quarters after ipo becomes the common event for all three companies at this time three companies have all experienced significantly different underlying fundamentals krispy kreme had the highest yeartoyear revenue growth at  and earnings growth of  on the other side of the spectrum dunkin brands had a  revenue growth and  earnings growth wingstop is practically right in the middle it has over  revenue and earnings growth rates and an impressive  profit margin see table below from company qs  bloomberg on the other hand by the end of  wingstop had sold  total commitments domestically and  internationally to open new franchised restaurants by the end of  wingstop had a total of  stores which are  of their goal of  restaurants see table below and company qs franchise risk a substantial portion of wingstops revenue comes from royalties generated by franchised restaurants franchise royalties constitutes a substantial portion to support the future growth accordingly wingstop is reliant on the performance of their franchisees in successfully operating their restaurants and paying royalties to the company on a timely basis expansions into new markets wingstop has been developing internationally while the company continues to open restaurants in new markets in the united states in some of these markets there may be limited or no market recognition of wingstops brand those markets may also have local competitive conditions such as differences in consumer tastes and culture franchisees may find it more difficult in new markets to hire motivate and keep qualified local employees who can project our vision passion and culture as a result it may take longer time and cost more to start a new franchise store in international markets wings falling from grace while the fast casual industry can deliver quality food fast the concept may also test new products fast however there is always an inherent risk that fast casual industry will change with the times these restaurants face high attrition rates in staff managers and diners the restaurants are chock full of people looking for the next hot item but as soon as something else comes along they can be gone as fast as they came for the onetrickpony wingstop the demand for speedy delivery and maintaining a good attitude may eventually create a toll on the workers additionally the restaurant industry in general has a reputation for having one of the highest employee turnover rates of any industry the combination of the lack of sales stability and a high strain on the work force can create a less than desired business situation for the company overvaluation the fair valuation process would suggest that the individual stock valuations will eventually correspond to earnings growth rates after adjusted for the underlying risk back in  kkds  pe has been considered excessive even for its  revenue growth rate relative to dnkns  pe for its  growth rate ironically in the aftermath of s internet bubble burst krispy kreme as a doughnut chain was still traded at an internet stocklike pe of  three years after that quarter mark kkd lost  market value which led to an acquisition by jab beech inc in  in contrast dnkn gained  two years after the quarter mark see figure below source yahoo finance the only silver lining from the historical pattern is the fact there may be still some upside remaining for ipos passing the twoyear anniversary of their growing pain even for krispy kreme there was another  in return in the following  months that being said do you know which stocks have pes at   and  they are apple nasdaq aapl facebook nasdaq fb and nvidia nasdaq nvda which are three of the most highflying growth stocks by todays standard see figure below do you really think that a chickenwing stock deserves a pe of  while dnkn is traded at a pe of  source bloomberg based on most earningsbased valuation metrics wings fair value is between  and  while it traded at  at the close of  maybe not winner winner chicken dinner disclosure iwe have
