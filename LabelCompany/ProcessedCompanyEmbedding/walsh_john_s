to the north of this community it is an unincorporated community located on the junction of ontario highways  and  in the township of wellington north places of worshipedit the first christian community established in walsh was the charlotteville methodist church constructed in  and located  kilometres to the south that community thrived through the  merger that created the united church of canada and beyond but suffered badly from declining membership during the great depression and it ceased operation in the early s after being vacant for nearly  years the building was demolished in  a commemorative monument remains in the northeast corner of the cemetery two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents walsh baptist church and st michaels roman catholic church walsh baptist church was established in  and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time during the first few decades of the th century a close collaboration developed with the charlotteville methodist church when the united church dissolved early during the second world war their remaining members were welcomed into the baptist community the baptist church annex including sunday school classrooms church hall kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of  the baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the turkey point road  metres or  feet north of the main intersection the walsh baptist church is led by pastor marc bertrand who has served the region since  st michaels catholic church was established in  although it functioned as a mission church of st cecilias parish in port dover in earlier years st michaels is now under the care of the sacred heart parish in langton another church that survived for about  years was the independent faith baptist church which officially broke away from congregation of the regular baptist church in  located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early s after several years of commercial usage the building was demolished historyedit preth centuryedit the walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants from around the year  until approximately – years later were the algonquin nation they were noted flintworkers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village the next wave of inhabitants were the attawandaron nation the neutrals who occupied the region from about  until their absorption by the iroquois  years later the last significant native nation to occupy the area was the mississaugas the first caucasian settlers in charlotteville were the united empire loyalist settlers from just prior to the year  charlotteville was named after queen charlotte wife of king george iii the ruling monarch at the time charlotteville roughly  square miles was surveyed by the walshwelch family with the work completed by  the township was laid out nine miles wide back from the nominal shoreline of lake erie on a chain spacing about four kilometres between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road now known as the turkey point road running northwards from turkey point through charlotteville centre and beyond perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads spaced  chains apart about  kilometres from the lake erie shore back to the north boundary the township of charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the county of norfolk in  because of its convenient central location charlotteville centre now known as walsh was designated the administrative centre the township hall building constructed at a cost of  in  still stands in later years the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of vittoria four miles to the southeast

terminated in  by the canadian national railways canadian national removed the railway tracks three years later in  the proximity to youngs creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location from a geographical perspective youngs creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through walsh and then vittoria before

williams and port rowan th centuryedit with the escalation of gasoline consumption after the great depression the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late s gas prices reached

walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers like in all communities towns and cities throughout the world global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of walsh throughout the decades the warmest summers that walsh has witnessed occurred in       with the exception of the month of july      and  should the sea levels rise by  metres or  feet walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding however it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away many major cities near salt

community established in walsh was the charlotteville methodist church constructed in  and located  kilometres to the south that community thrived through the  merger that created the united church of canada and beyond but suffered badly from declining membership during the great depression and it ceased operation in the early s after being vacant for nearly  years the building was demolished in  a

michaels roman catholic church walsh baptist church was established in  and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time during the first few decades of the th century a close collaboration developed with the charlotteville methodist church when the united church dissolved early during the second world war their remaining members were welcomed into the baptist community the

established in  although it functioned as a mission church of st cecilias parish in port dover in earlier years st michaels is now under the care of the sacred heart parish in langton another church that survived for about  years was the independent faith baptist church which officially broke away from congregation of the regular baptist church in  located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early s after several years of commercial usage the building was demolished historyedit preth centuryedit the walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants from around the year  until approximately – years later were the algonquin nation they were noted flintworkers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village the next wave of inhabitants were the attawandaron nation the neutrals who occupied the region from about  until their absorption by the iroquois  years later the last significant native nation to occupy the area was the mississaugas the first caucasian settlers in charlotteville were the united empire loyalist settlers from just prior to the year  charlotteville was named after queen charlotte wife of king george iii the ruling monarch at the time charlotteville roughly  square miles was surveyed by the walshwelch family with the work completed by  the township was laid out nine miles wide back from the nominal shoreline of lake erie on a chain spacing about four kilometres between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road now known as the turkey point road running northwards from turkey point through charlotteville centre and beyond perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads spaced  chains apart about  kilometres from the lake erie shore back to the north boundary the township of charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the county of norfolk in  because of its convenient central location charlotteville centre now known as walsh was designated the administrative centre the township hall building constructed at a cost of  in  still stands in later years the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of vittoria four miles to the southeast walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after charlotteville township was surveyed located at the intersection of the middle of five

an added advantage favouring the location from a geographical perspective youngs creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through walsh and then vittoria before
