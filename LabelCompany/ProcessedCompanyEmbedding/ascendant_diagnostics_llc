ascendant diagnostics llc is an early stage biotechnology company located in fayetteville ar with a mission of developing low cost noninvasive biomarker based diagnostic tests for the early detection of serious diseases ascendant diagnostics first product in development melodydx™ is a highly accurate lowcost noninvasive diagnostic screening test for the detection of breast cancer a tandem mass spectrometry lcms based test will be designed to be implimented in a clia certified medical testing laboratory in this design ocular wash samples could be collected at a physician’s office and sent to the testing facility after testing and analysis is complete the results would be sent back to the consulting physician’s office to be relayed to the patient ascendant has established a working relationship with peacehealth laboratories of vancouver washington a clia certified medical testing laboratory which specializes in lcms based medical testing a key innovation of ascendant’s detection platform is in the use of ocular wash samples as the testing fluid the collection of ocular wash is simple quick pain free and noninvasive this fluid is well suited as a diagnostic material because it contains proteins in high concentrations ugul and changes in ocular protein content can reflect normal or disease states in addition ocular wash samples are a more accommodating fluid to work with as very little sample preparation is needed compared to other human fluids such as urine or blood  importantly the reduced sample preparation and handling is likely to reduce the overall cost and time

breast cancer using the protein profile of a person’s tears the komen ozark race for the cure® held saturday april th in rogers provided ascendant diagnostics the opportunity to setup a tear collection booth in order to gather samples from race day attendees tear collection requires a simple saline wash of the surface of the eye these anonymous samples will be used for test development in ascendant diagnostics’ research laboratory dr anna daily chief scientist led the effort and was assisted in tear collection by nurses and support staff from highlands oncology and the breast center volunteers helped to answer questions about the company and the collection process as well as recruit volunteers from the race day crowds ascendant diagnostics currently is conducting clinical studies with five clinics nationwide two of which are located in northwest arkansas the breast center is collecting samples from  individuals who are undergoing a biopsy for evaluation of a suspicious mass and highlands oncology is collecting samples from  individuals who are being treated for metastatic breast cancer with these two clinics meeting the need for samples collected from patients with masses as well as breast cancer the company’s current greatest need was to fill the “tear bank” with samples for general population studies a step necessary for commercialization of a diagnostic test saturday’s event in which  tear samples were volunteered provided an excellent start towards generating ascendant diagnostics’ tear bank tear samples were also collected from men a population for whom there is currently no screening as well as from breast cancer survivors these samples will be used in future research applications of melodydx™ ascendant diagnostics’ vision is to greatly increase the accuracy of cancer diagnostics enable detection of disease at the earliest possible stage and improve patient compliance through the use of noninvasive painfree diagnostic tools the companys first product melodydx is a patent pending noninvasive biomarker panel for the detection of breast cancer which detects differences in proteins present in human tears the goal for melodydx is to increase breast cancer detection at earlier stages while at the same time reducing unnecessary exposure to radiation and painful biopsy procedures ascendant diagnostics llc is a vic technology venture
