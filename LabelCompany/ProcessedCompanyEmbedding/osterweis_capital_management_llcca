investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost current performance of the fund may be higher or lower than the performance quoted rates of return for periods greater than one year are annualized monthly performance philosophy we believe that by avoiding the “style box” trap and having the flexibility to invest in multiple classes of bonds we can manage each portfolio in such a way as to emphasize the most attractive sector at any given time by strategically shifting out of overvalued assets we strive to minimize potential risk and produce better returns over time furthermore our research has shown that the various sectors of the bond market behave differently under different economic conditions for instance during periods of economic expansion high yield and convertible bonds tend to perform well as rising corporate profits lead to improved credit profiles conversely they tend to perform very poorly during periods of economic contraction as credit profiles deteriorate during such recessionary periods investment grade bonds generally prove to be better performers because of their responsiveness to declining interest rates within particular sectors we choose individual securities based on rigorous fundamental and credit analysis we emphasize a thorough understanding of each company’s balance sheet by determining the company’s ability to generate recurring free cash flow from its operations as a result we do a significant amount of work to determine the company’s business prospects as well as the positive and negative levers in its financial model which influence the company’s ability to generate cash flow we believe that we find our best investments in companies that have great products a competitive advantage that gives them pricing power in the market a consistent operating history and management that operate the company as if they own it finally we determine what we believe to be the appreciation potential versus the downside risk to gauge the attractiveness of the security versus other available investment opportunities over time we expect the maturity structure credit quality and sector concentration of the portfolio will differ during periods of economic contraction versus economic expansion in short we will employ a strategy based on the belief that over the long term positive returns can be achieved and losses minimized through careful security selection and by shifting the allocation among fixed income sectors investment team carl p kaufman copresident cochief

strategy predicated on the belief that strong longterm investment results are best achieved through a compounding of reasonable gains and the avoidance of major losses we therefore consciously strive to limit downside exposure as much as to generate upside returns we focus on outoffavor undervalued situations with low pe pb and pfcf ratios and strong or rapidly improving cash flow dynamics we seek to avoid fads and speculatively priced stocks where the risk of mistakes is high we continually search for underresearched growth situations that can be purchased for modest multiples as such companies gain recognition and are accorded multiples more in line with their growth rates we may become sellers we also tend to focus on asset rich companies with improving earning prospects in short we often follow the old saying “buy assets sell earnings” this tends to reduce the risk of earnings disappointments underlying everything we do is an intense focus on cash flow especially a company’s ability to generate free cash flow after all expenses and capital spending cash flow is more real than reported earnings which are subject to accounting manipulation companies that generate strong free cash flow are able to repay debt repurchase shares and grow through acquisitions or reinvestment in their businesses they are also attractive acquisition targets for both other companies and financial buyers because of these characteristics companies with rising free cash flow are often better able to grow regardless of stock market conditions and at the same time may offer downside protection during periods of market weakness investment team john s osterweis chairman  chief investment officer view bio osterweis fund institutional equity fund strategic investment fund core equity
