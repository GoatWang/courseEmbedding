an insurance product why are annuities considered an insurance product annuities are financial vehicles that can be sold only by insurance companies basically an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company which promises to pay you a future income in exchange for the lumpsum payment or premiums that you pay the payments specified in the annuity contract will be paid to you during your retirement or in some situations to your beneficiaries after your death annuities can be used to help ensure a steady stream of income in retirement as well as to help ensure that your spouse andor designated beneficiary will be taken care of in the event of your death many types of annuities exist and most of them include a death benefit option if you elect to annuitize your annuity contract you are choosing to receive your payments on a schedule that can be based on a single or joint life expectancy for you and your spouse for example or for a specified period of time once you begin receiving payments most annuity contracts do not allow money to be paid to your heirs other than your designated jointlife beneficiary in the event of your death however if you die before annuitization begins your designated beneficiary typically will receive a death benefit at least equal to the net premiums paid some annuity contracts may offer refunds or guarantees allowing your beneficiary to receive the remaining amount upon your death the accumulated value or premiums paid whichever is greater if you would like to use your annuity to help provide for your heirs make sure to examine the contract closely for specific beneficiary allowances generally annuities have contract limitations fees and charges which can include mortality and expense charges account fees underlying investment management fees administrative fees and charges for optional benefits most annuities have surrender charges that are assessed during the early years of the contract if the contract owner surrenders the annuity withdrawals of annuity earnings are taxed as ordinary income and may be subject to surrender charges plus a  federal income tax penalty if made before you reach age ½ withdrawals reduce annuity contract benefits and values any guarantees are contingent on the financial strength and claimspaying ability of the issuing insurance company annuities are not
