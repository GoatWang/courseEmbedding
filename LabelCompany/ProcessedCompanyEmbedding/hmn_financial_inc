the largest thrifts in the state in march  a number of spring valley businessmen met in the commercial rooms over the state theater to hear a talk by mr ch ellingson a united states government official employed by the federal home loan bank board of washington dc mr ellingson had been requested to address the club on the subject of organizing a federal savings and loan association for spring valley and the surrounding territory the great depression was at its height and money for home loans was very scarce the objective of the federal government was twofold first to set up a means of providing credit for financing the construction of homes thus giving employment to laborers and also business to material dealers secondly to provide a safe place for the investment of the limited funds of local savers so the money would remain in the community and be put to use here the idea appealed to the men present at the meeting and a modest amount of capital was raised locally shortly thereafter a federal charter was secured and the secretary of the treasury of the united states invested a total of  in the association all of which funds have since been repaid to the federal government branch offices were authorized and opened in austin in  rochester in  and  winona in  la crescent in  albert lea in  marshalltown ia in  rochester in   and  eagan in  and kasson in  in june

do not open any attachments or click on any links it may contain home federal will never request personal information in response to an email never provide sensitive account or personal information in response to an email if you have entered personal information call home federal immediately when encountering a popup window be aware of the followinghome federal does not use popup windows to request customer account information we will never display a popup window on our site that you havent requested by clicking on a link – all of our popup windows are userinitiated popup windows are often the result of programs installed on your computer called adware or spyware these programs look in on your web viewing activity and regularly come hidden inside many free downloads such as musicsharing software or screen savers many of these programs enable harmless advertisements but some contain trojan horse programs that can record your keystrokes or relay other information to an unauthorized source practice safe computing home federal wants to empower you with some tips you can take to help you protect your computer and your personal information when you are online protect your passwords keep your passwords in a secure place and out of plain view dont share your passwords on the internet over email or on the phone a home federal associate will never ask for your password use passwords that have at least eight characters and include numbers or symbols avoid common words some hackers use programs that can try every word in the dictionary do not use your personal information your login name or adjacent keys on the keyboard as passwords change your passwords regularly at a minimum every  days do not use the same password for each online account you access one way to create a strong password is to think of a memorable phrase which is unique to you and use the first letter of each word as your password converting some letters into numbers that resemble letters for example how much wood could a woodchuck chuck would become hmwcwcc keep your computer operating system up to date if your computer is more than five years old its operating system eg windows  os  etc may not offer the same level of protection as newer systems system manufacturers provide frequent updates to help make your system more secure some manufacturers supply updates automatically through email or

request that a short or longterm fraud alert be placed on your credit file which requires creditors to verify your identity before opening any new accounts in your name or changing any existing accounts you only need to contact one bureau to do this — that bureau will notify the others credit bureaus must provide victims of identity theft with a free copy of their credit report you should request one from each bureau since the information can differ look them over carefully to see if any fraudulent accounts have been opened and if so notify the credit bureau and the companies where accounts were opened to report the fraud directly once the dispute has been resolved the credit bureaus that you dealt with will send you another copy of your credit report so you can review it again to make sure that all fraudulent activity has stopped and your file has been corrected for more information about the steps to take and to get your credit reports contact the credit bureaus listed below equifax  or wwwequifaxcom experian  or wwwexperiancom transunion  or wwwtransunioncom contact other creditors contact your other creditors including credit card and phone companies as well as banks and other lenders to notify them of potential fraud always follow up any telephone conversations with a letter close any accounts that have been breached and reopen them with new account numbers and passwords we strongly suggest not using your social security number as either a username or password file report with local police contact your local police department if you suspect that your personal information was stolen a police report will lend weight to your case when dealing with creditors who may require proof of criminal activity contact other agencies as appropriate postal inspection service at wwwuspscom if you believe your mail was stolen or redirected notify the postal inspector at your local post office social security fraud hotline at  if you suspect someone is using your social security number for fraudulent purposes call the hotline carefully review all your accounts since identity theft takes time to completely resolve you should continue to carefully review all charges and transactions appearing on account statements and online any discrepancies should be reported immediately scam types scammers are continuously devising new methods of defrauding the general public below are common fraud attempts and alerts to keep you in the know fraudulent lottery winnings one of the ways fraudsters try to trick you out of your money is to make it appear as if you won a lottery in this scam you are sent a letter stating youve won a lottery the letter will go on to say that in order to claim your winnings you need to send an administrative fee they may even send you a check to cover this fee how does the scam work the check you received is fraudulent unsuspecting people will deposit this check and subsequently wire funds to the lottery administration the check will be returned by the payee bank as fraudulent this generally happens after the unsuspecting person has wired the funds at this time the person that wired the funds is now responsible for the check that has been returned to their account and most likely there is no way to recover the amount of funds wired out to the lottery administration how to protect yourself from these scams ask yourself if you entered into any lotteries if not it is most likely a scam be aware that it is illegal to participate in foreign lotteries if the letter states youve won a lottery outside the us it is most likely a scam bring your letter to us to help you determine if it is fraudulent we see many of these so we may be able to spot more areas to help determine if its fraudulent always rememberif its too good to be true it probably is fraudulent phishing online fraud occurs when someone poses as a legitimate company to obtain your sensitive personal data and illegally conducts transactions on your existing accounts often called phishing or spoofing the most current methods of online fraud are fake emails websites and popup windows or any combination of these always keep in mind that any unsolicited request for home federal account information you receive through emails websites or popup windows should be considered fraudulent and reported to us immediately phishing emails will often ask you for personal information fake emails often contain an overly generic greeting and may claim that your information has been compromised that your account has been frozen or ask you to confirm the authenticity of your transactions appear to be from a legitimate source while some emails are easy to identify as fraudulent others may appear to be from a legitimate address and trusted online source however you should not rely on the name or address in the from field as this is easily altered contain fraudulent job offers some fake emails appear to be from companies offering jobs these are often workathome accounting positions which are actually schemes that victimize both the job applicant and other customers be sure to confirm that the job offer is from a known and trusted company contain prizes or gift certificate offers some fake emails promise a prize or gift certificate in exchange for completing a survey or answering questions in order to collect the alleged prize or gift certificate you may be directed to provide your personal information just like with job offers be sure to confirm that prize or gift certificate is being issued from a known and trusted company link to counterfeit web sites fake emails may direct you to counterfeit web sites carefully designed to look real but which actually collect personal information for illegal use link to real web sites in addition to links to counterfeit web sites some fake emails also include links to legitimate web sites the fraudsters do this in an attempt to make a fake email appear real contain fraudulent phone numbers fake emails often contain telephone numbers that are tied to the fraudsters never call a number featured on an email you suspect is fraudulent and be sure to doublecheck any numbers you do call contain real phone numbers some of the telephone numbers listed in fake emails may be legitimate connecting to actual companies just like with links fraudsters include the real phone numbers in an effort to make the email appear to be legitimate how is your email obtained email addresses can be obtained from publicly available sources or through randomly generated lists so if you receive a fake email that appears to be from home federal this does not mean that your email address name or any other information has been taken from home federals systems popup windows popup windows are the small windows or ads that appear suddenly over or under the window you are currently viewing fraudulent popup windows are a type of online fraud often used to obtain personal information online fraud occurs when someone poses as a legitimate company—like a popular shopping site your bank or your internet service provider—to obtain sensitive personal data and illegally conducts transactions on your existing accounts often called phishing or spoofing the most current types of online fraud include fake popup windows emails and web sites or any combination of these trojan horses these fake emails may also contain a virus known as a trojan horse that can record your keystrokes the virus may live in an attachment or be accessed via a link in the emaildont forget that we do not request personal information via email or send email attachments never respond to emails open attachments or click on links from suspicious or unknown sendersif youre not sure if a home federal email is legitimate report it to us without replying to the email counterfeit websites online thieves often direct you to fraudulent web sites via email and popup

infohfsbcom if you encounter a fake web site or popup window or if you responded to one of these with personal information call home federal immediately atm skimming atm skimming is the theft of card information it occurs during legitimate transactions from atms how atm skimming works to steal your information thieves install electronic devices called skimmers over the normal card reading slot of atm machines these skimmers record the data from the magnetic strip on the back of your card a tiny camera is often hidden near a skimmer to record your pin as it is entered the thieves then use all of the information they have gathered to manufacture counterfeit cards make purchases and withdraw funds from your accounts skimming devices come in many forms and can be hard to detect the image below illustrates how a skimming device and hidden camera can be installed on an atm actual devices may vary from this example where to look for signs of atm skimming protect yourself use secure atm machines under video surveillance or inside of a bank lobby theyre less likely to be tampered with pay careful attention to what the card reader and keypad normally look like on the atms you use most frequently dont use an atm if the card reader appears to be added on fits poorly or is loose some thieves place a fake box over the card slot that reads and records account and pin numbers call the customer service number on the atm immediately if a machine appears suspicious or if it does not function properly mystery shoppingjob scam fraudulent mystery shopping promoters are using newspaper ads and emails to create the impression that theyre a gateway to lucrative mystery shopper jobs with reputable companies these solicitations usually promote a website where consumers can register to become mystery shoppers — after they pay a fee for information about a certification program a directory of mystery shopping companies or a guarantee of a mystery shopping job the truth is that it is unnecessary to pay money to anyone to get into the mystery shopper business the shopping certification offered in advertising or unsolicited email is almost always worthless a list of companies that hire mystery shoppers is available for free and legitimate mystery shopper jobs are on the internet for free consumers who try to get a refund from promoters of mystery shopping jobs usually are out of luck either the business doesnt return the phone calls or if it does its to try another pitch in another version of the scam consumers are hired to be mystery shoppers and told that their first assignment is to evaluate a money transfer service likewestern unionor moneygram the shopper receives a check with instructions to deposit it in a personal bank account withdraw the amount in cash and wire it to a third party by law banks must make the funds from deposited checks available within days but uncovering a fake check can take weeks individuals are responsible for the checks they deposit so if a check turns out to be a fake they are responsible for paying the bank back its a good idea never to deposit a check from someone you dont know especially if the stranger asks you to wire money consumers should be skeptical of mystery shopping promoters who advertise for mystery shoppers in a newspapers help wanted section or by email while it may appear as if these companies are hiring mystery shoppers its much more likely that theyre pitching unnecessary — and possibly bogus — mystery shopping services require that you pay for certification guarantee a job as a mystery shopper charge a fee for access to mystery shopping opportunities sell directories of companies that employ mystery shoppers ask you to deposit a check and wire some or all of the money to someone ebaycraigs list scam thinking of selling a car or another valuable item through an online auction if so the federal trade commission ftc the nations consumer protection agency wants you to know about check overpayment scams according to ftc officials the scams work like this someone responds to your posting or ad and offers to use a cashiers check personal check or corporate check to pay for the item youre selling at the last minute the socalled buyer or the buyers agent comes up with a reason for writing the check for more than the purchase price and asks you to wire back the difference after you deposit the check you deposit the check and wire the funds back to the buyers later the check bounces leaving you liable for the entire amount the checks are counterfeit says the ftc but good enough to fool the unsuspecting in a different version of the scam the ftc says consumers get a check that has their winnings from a lottery theyre asked to pay taxes or fees sometimes the sender claims to be trapped in a foreign country without any way to cash the check either way federal officials say if you deposit the check youll lose heres how to avoid a check overpayment scam know who youre dealing with in any transaction independently confirm the buyers name street address and telephone number dont accept a check for more than your selling price no matter how tempting ask the buyer to write the check for the correct amount if the buyer refuses to send the correct amount return the check dont send the merchandise consider an alternative method of payment as a seller you can suggest an escrow service or online payment service there may be a charge for an escrow service if the buyer insists on using a particular escrow or online payment service youve never heard of check it out visit its website and read its terms of agreement and privacy policy call the customer service line if there isnt one or if you call and cant get answers about the services reliability dont use the service to learn more about escrow services and online payment systems visit wwwonguardonlinegovtopicsonlineshoppingaspx if you accept payment by check ask for a check drawn on a local bank or a bank with a local branch that way you can make a personal visit to make sure the check is valid if thats not possible call the bank where it was purchased and ask if the check is valid get the banks phone number from directory assistance or an internet site that you know and trust not from the person who gave you the check if the buyer insists that you wire back funds end the transaction immediately legitimate buyers dont pressure you to send money bywestern union or a similar company in addition you have little recourse if theres a problem with a wire transaction resist any pressure to act now if the buyers offer is good now it should be good after the check clears the issuing bank throw away any offer that asks you to pay for a prize or a gift if its free or a gift you shouldnt have to pay for it free is free scam alerts smishing scam alert the rochester police department has received several  callscomplaints about a text message saying you have just won a  walmart gift card this is not
