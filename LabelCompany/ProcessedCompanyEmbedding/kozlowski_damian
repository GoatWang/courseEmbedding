officer damian kozlowski damian damian kozlowski thank you andres good morning and thank you for joining us today my name is damian kozlowski im ceo of bancorp and the president of the bancorp bank ive been in these positions since june   i welcome you to our first quarter  earnings call while  was a very typical year for our company first quarter  financial results reflected our planned return to profitability while we did incur financial losses in  it did set the stage to make progress on many key issues that faced the company we believe that the actions taken in  have resulted in a much stronger platform and the first quarter  was the start of what we believe will be a year of improving performance in the quarter the bancorp earned  million in net income or  a share of  of total revenue net of interest expense our earnings showed substantial improvement and revenue momentum continues while expense cuts and restructuring had a noticeable impact on profitability here are some of the highlights from the first quarter that underpin our progress our integrated business plan has been completed and we are now in full execution stage with a copy of the plan on our website as part of the plan indiscernible we created a detailed  budget and strategic agenda for the company this budget has been approved by our board and is consistent with the threeyear plan in the first quarter we exceeded our internal budget and are tracking well with all our key initiatives we see opportunity on the upside of our financial targets with potential recoveries upon the disposal of certain assets such as the florida mall which we hold as other real estate owned interest rate increases in december and march are having a positive impact on operating revenue future consensus increases are also expected to have a significant positive impact our expenses continue to show improvement our cost reduction effort has identified approximately  million operating cost savings from  over  a portion of which we began to realize in the first quarter european prepaid operations have been sold the transaction closed april rd and our operating expenses by an estimated  per quarter the sales of the remainder of our hsa business was approved by the occ and all accounts are to be transferred by the end of the second quarter the related gain on sales anticipate to significantly offset costs associated with the european prepaid operations sale and also reduced run rate operating costs all the cost savings are on target with about  completion of the phase  cost restructuring implemented projecting the realization of the savings on a quarterly basis is difficult our progress in reducing expense should continue throughout  core revenue continued to growth both quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear the yearoveryear business growth was led by leasing the balances for which increased  quarteroverquarter business growth was also led by leasing the balances of which increased in percent on an annualized basis our other lending products also continue to show growth and our business leaders report that continuing prospects remained very positive we are continuing to make headway concerning our regulatory situation we made significant progress in creating a new integrated compliance program that will build off our work in bsaaml thirdparty risk and consumer compliance this project is on track to be fully completed by the end of the second quarter and should substantially improve our compliance operating environment we continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and resolve the root causes of any issues we also continued to hire key new management in the last quarter that have already been announced and more new key executives will be announced soon in summary i believe the first quarter is a turning point we have a long way to go to fully implement our integrated business plan but we are on track to deliver better results for all the constituencies that comprise the bancorp community im now turning the call over to paul frenkiel our cfo who will review the financial results in more detail paul frenkiel thank you damian consistent with our business plan and budget bancorp returned to profitability in the first quarter of  net income was  million for the quarter reflecting both revenue growth and progress in expense reduction in addition to a significant gain on sale of loans into securitization a significant contributor to first quarter earnings was a  million gain on sale of loans into a variable rate commercial loan securitization through  additional loans are expected to be originated with at least one additional securitization anticipated by yearend while the  million gain on sale was a major contributor to the first quarter the balances of the loans sold no longer earn interest for the company therefore related interest income was reduced during the quarter and will be lower and total loans are replaced by new originations accordingly the company earned  million dollars less interest on such loans in q  compared to q  nonetheless net interest income for the company as a whole grew  to  million between those periods the increase in net interest income reflected growth in leasing sba and sbloc loans and the impact of the  basis point rate increase in december  since the first quarter  rate increase occurred in midmarch the full quarter positive impact will not be realized until the second quarter although linked quarter net interest income was comparable it similarly reflected  million reductions in interest on loans held for sale into securitizations excluding that factor net interest income on a linked quarter basis also grew at an annualized rate in the  range our largest percentage increase in loan balances was in leases which grew organically  over the year with  overall growth after considering a purchase portfolio in the first quarter  the leasing portfolio yielded approximately  purchases of lease portfolios while maintaining yield levels continue to confirm the viability of this growth strategy loan balances excluding loans held for sale grew  yearoveryear the lines of business comprising these totals have historically had low chargeoffs our cost of funds grew minimally reflecting only a partial adjustment of rates on our prepaid card deposits to changes in market interest rates prepaid card deposits are our largest funding source and should continue to adjust to only a portion of future increases in market interest rates the interest margin will benefit accordingly with the impact of market interest rates on variable rate sbloc and sba loans and the significant portion of the investment portfolio which is also rate sensitive prepaid cards are the primary driver of noninterest income in the first quarter of the year prepaid card fee income is traditionally higher reflecting these related to tax refund prepaid cards accordingly in q prepaid fees were  million higher than the linked quarter compared to the prior year first quarter prepaid fees were flat reflecting the impact of a client that exited as a result of its sale reflecting that factor and the decision of several other clients to terminate their prepaid card programs altogether the total amount spent on prepaid cards or gross dollar volume was down slightly compared to q  growth in other programs significantly offset the impact of those changes resulting in that slight volume decrease reductions in noninterest expenses also contributed to first quarter results noninterest expense of  million for the quarter was lower than  quarters and reflected progress in implementing expense reductions in several areas as damian noted additional reductions have been identified and should be realized throughout  net interest margin for the quarter was  compared to  in q  and  to the linked quarter seasonal deposit inflows reduced net interest margins in the first quarter of the year as the temporary excess liquidity earns a nominal rate at the federal reserve bank the improvement in net interest margin over q  reflected the impact of the rate increase in december  which resulted in higher asset yields versus the lesser increase in deposit costs as noted earlier the  million net income from discontinued operations reflected the results of the discontinued philadelphia commercial loan division in addition to the interest which continues to be earned on those loans the quarter benefited from  million of loan recoveries primarily on the florida mall loan a significant writedown to apprise value was made on that mall loan in third quarter  we took ownership of the florida mall property during the quarter and we are marketing it for sale based on market indications we anticipate a recovery upon its anticipated sale later this year but the amount of such recovery and timing are difficult to predict while the financial results for the quarter reflected federal income tax expense at statutory rates reversal of valuation allowances are expected later in  leverage of capital ratios are impacted by seasonal tax refund deposit inflows in the first quarter of each year which temporarily distort capital ratios notwithstanding that first quarter distortion the leverage ratio at the bank and holding company were respectively  and  at quarter end in the coming quarters after that temporary distortion the leverage ratio should increase and increase further with earnings accretion our capital plan projects an  leverage ratio later in  riskbased capital ratios are not impacted by the first quarter tax refund deposit inflows as related funds are maintained at the federal reserve bank which has a zero risk rating those ratios immediately benefited from the first quarter earnings and exceeded  at quarter end that concludes my comments and i will turn the call back to andres andres viroslav thank you operator please open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of william wallace of raymond james your line is now open william wallace thanks good morning guys damian kozlowski hey how is it going william wallace good thank you paul ill start with your last commentary and your remarks about the distortion related to the tax refund deposits that pressured the leverage ratio how much comes bounce back do you expect from the normalization of that kind of seasonality paul frenkiel we went up in deposits about  over what we were running it is really difficult to predict because it is hard to predict when those tax refund prepaid cards are spent but in all likelihood well get to  fairly quickly and as i said our plan and our projections show  later in  william wallace okay so are you anticipating that youll get to  in the second half now at all i was thinking that you guys were modeling by the end of the second quarter but i might be wrong paul frenkiel we have a significant valuation allowance which is you know after the company has not performed well over the last three years and taking losses management and also the people who provide support to us our accountants i think believe its prudent to show profitability for longer term than one quarter before we were to reverse that allowance but thats likely to happen and that will be a significant impact of that  leverage ratio or probably in the  million range william wallace yes so what is the – whats the dollar amount of the valuation allowance as of march st paul frenkiel it is in excess of  million william wallace yes the actual dollar amount paul frenkiel it is a difficult computation because there multiple items as damian noted we sold the foreign operation there are some tax implications of that so i think were right now… damian kozlowski its at least  its in the  million to  million range paul frenkiel yes william wallace and you say youll have the final number by the time you follow the q is still being calculated paul frenkiel it is actually trued up at year end all our cashes are trued up at year end yes well have an estimate by the q william wallace okay so the   equity balance might not be what you end up reporting i confused im sorry i thought that the dpa ph is not in the equity paul frenkiel yes when we reversed the valuation allowance its actually going to be a credit to tax expense with flows directly to the bottom line and directly to equity there are some twists in terms of how that translates to capital and it depends on timing of deductions and so forth so but as i said before what we do through that up at yearend the actual interim period tax calculations are based on your estimates for the year so i cant give you an exact number because the accounting rules just don’t work that way they don’t… damian kozlowski and it wont impact the first quarter its likely a second or third quarter event when we will change that and then you would take into that impact into net income there so for adjusting the ratios william wallace okay so assuming that you were to have reversed the allowance this quarter do you know how much you could have put in the tier  capital calculation without tripping over the  threshold paul frenkiel as i said before it’s not a meaningful calculation because you do it based on what you estimate for the year the accounting rule says you estimate what your tax situation is for the year and then you allocate that to the quarter william wallace so what about for the call report rules so you have to i mean you have to put a number in the call report when you are calculating your tier  capital right paul frenkiel you have to do an estimate that’s true william wallace so if you were to have been able to reduce it how much room is there for dta in your tier  capital what i am trying to get at is how much of brisk is the tier  leverage are you going to get when you reverse the allowance just trying to figure out paul frenkiel i can go through it with you it’s actually not final until we do our tax return we actually have two sets of tax advisors that work with us so i think there are some it depends on the timing of deductions and the character of the deferred tax assets i can go through with you i can show you i can explain to you offline the difficulties and the estimation but we can’t the  million is a good estimate william wallace okay so i can assume as i model my own calculation of capital that  million will be recaptured into tier  capital when you reverse the allowance  million to  million paul frenkiel that is within our planning and it’s subject to eventual with the tax damian kozlowski but that also accounts for showing continued profitability which we believe we will reverse william wallace right of course paul frenkiel thats why it wasn’t reversed in the first quarter though because it was the first quarter profitability really demonstrated the last three years so the advisors and collective with management of the board believe that it was prudent not to reverse it until there was a better track record of performance william wallace okay and i believe last quarter you guys stated that you anticipated reversing it in the second quarter is that still the case or is this more likely to be a third or fourth quarter event paul frenkiel as damian said we use multiple advisors yes it’s possible the second quarter that like we are – thats in our thinking but it could be the third quarter william wallace okay and then for the tax rate that you recorded in the first quarter are you is  of that go get in allowance against it paul frenkiel yes but there are few caveats as i said before because there are implications connected to the sale of our european operations that will impact that somewhat so i would just stick for now with the  million william wallace okay and then what’s the assets related to the european business that will come off the balance sheet or are they off already paul frenkiel they are fairly minimal under you know like  to  of assets some liabilities you know so it’s not a significant impact the more significant impact to us is it’s going to further reduce our overhead we are estimating in the  a quarter range damian kozlowski yes this was not a business that was creating operating profitability so there was  more expense than revenue coming william wallace when will this sale close paul frenkiel april its already closed they are already closed william wallace so we see that in the run rate for the second quarter there paul frenkiel absolutely damian kozlowski there will be a restructuring charge associated with that sale and that will be offset by the hsa sale you see we are getting there william wallace okay paul frenkiel it’s going to be around it’s somewhere between  million and  million william wallace but thats the restructuring charge paul frenkiel yes it hasn’t been calculated yet so we don’t know what the final charge will be and what well be able to take but that on an economic basis it will offset by the hsa gain william wallace okay okay great so and in the hsa youve got it’s about  million of deposits that will come off the balance sheet paul frenkiel no the hsa is about  million most of which will be off by the end of this quarter damian kozlowski yes we just received final approval from the occ in this quarter a letter approval and we weren’t able to act on transferring the accounts until that was finalized which it was and so we have a plan in place to get that transfer completed by the end of the quarter therefore taking the gain at the same time we lower our operating expense by having less accounts william wallace okay have you identified additional opportunities for deleverage outside of just oneoff of the tax deposits damian kozlowski yes we’re still targeting around a  billion balance sheet at the end of the second quarter  to  so that’s where we should be around there depending on the business volumes and everything but that’s where we are hoping to be william wallace okay so in the loan sale gain that’s your commercial mortgage business you didn’t wrap loans out of the commercial out of the discontinued portfolio did you paul frenkiel no we are we  because of the market conditions in cmbs there is a whole bunch of changes that happened including the retention of risk strips but the market has significantly changed over the last couple of years we discontinued our cmbs program so we are not originating for sale fixed rate loans anymore for the cmbs market these are floating rate loans that go into securitization clo like securitization we did last year that are and then we are also doing institutional sales of those loans to third parties so we are focused on that program that program does not have a hedge obviously because its floating rate and so you don’t take gains and losses on the hedge either so it’s a less volatile business in addition to being – its in the less challenged part of the market william wallace okay and is it the same team or did you change teams paul frenkiel no the underwriting teams were doing both types of loans so you know were an integrated group and that integrated group is really a marketing decision so with our network of brokers and other sales force now were just focusing on one side of the house really we don’t think after talking broadly in the marketplace it will affect our ability to originate the floating rate side we are targeting one more at least one more securitization such as we’ve done previously this year in the floating rate side and on a run rate basis well probably do two securitizations andor our large sales of loans in the  million range per year on a go forward basis they will not be in the cmbs market william wallace okay oaky all right paul frenkiel so weve narrowed focused the business and i think we’ve reduced the volatility based on hedging in that business consistent with the rest of the business plan to increase the transparency of the company and lower the volatility of earnings william wallace so the  million dollar expense booked in the first quarter was obviously a significant improvement over the fourth quarter and third quarters so it’s good to see very good movement towards the expense initiative i assume there is probably some variable comp in there also associated with that sale for that securitization is that so what if you stripped out the variable comps issue with that what will the rate have been what would the expense have been how much variable comp was in that paul frenkiel it doesn’t necessarily hit the same quarter it’s accrued the variable comp is somewhat independent of that timing so it’s difficult to match it up damian kozlowski yes but there are what we can say about the expense run rate is that we are very pleased with that we are getting better cost reductions then we expected at this time our own budget had it at significantly higher rate so our significant cost saves that haven’t even  weve negotiated many of our providers to significant cost saves they haven’t come through the hsa saves because of the number of accounts there are other accounts that are exiting the business so we find the platform the european cost saves there is a whole list of things we’ve done on te and others costs saves so there is  while its about  completed the initiative phase  which remember phase  was reducing people phase  is reducing operating costs and phase  will kick off in october november which will be a reengineering of the back end of the business but we are very happy with where we are on the expense side and we have still a lot of expenses that will be reduced in the second and third quarters so we are very optimistic that we will continue to open the jaws of the business and reduce cost william wallace would you care to update your expectations for cost saves it sounds as if that  million… damian kozlowski yes we will wally we will we still haven’t fully bridged it out we are in the process of really understanding this things like cne ph or just to give an example that we were targeting to do it half but it’s even coming in better than that so you know there are some of these buckets that we’re trying to understand exactly why when you cut  of the people we were at over  people this time last year i think it was almost  people and we are now running at below  people right and that’s if you take europe out of it and you take the restructuring that we did people tend to draw cost and so we are trying to understand exactly what the cost structure is why is it different than the saves we have in there and we’re bridging it out and then we will probably give better guidance as we go into the second or the end of the second quarter and see where we are but right now we are very optimistic that we will be able to beat our own internal budgets on the cost side william wallace okay well damian it’s pleasing to see a quarter that doesn’t have noise related to credit and ill hop out and let somebody else ask questions and maybe which may someone else will ask about the credit and the other portfolios so thanks for taking my questions damian kozlowski thanks wally operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from frank schiraldi of sandler oneill your line is now open damian kozlowski hey frank frank schiraldi good morning just follow up on capital i just  the  tier  leverage by i guess it’s by yearend is that what you said damian is that the feeling the thinking damian kozlowski definitely by year end well probably be we do have when we read our own scenarios we want to get back to our capital minimum that weve stated to our regulators which is  of tier  capital i want to also emphasize that the risk based measures are very very healthy for the company for various reasons but we do have visibility to an  by the end of the year we think we will hit the  before that probably in some time in the third quarter it depends on the valuation allowance and our continued profitability once taking that in the capital ratios will improve dramatically and as our cost saves continue to be realized net income will be generated so you can see an  happening after the second to third quarter timeframe frank schiraldi okay and then you get up to  by when did you say you think that’s possible by year end damian kozlowski yes we think we do have visibility to  by the end of the year when we do our own projections id say this in the most likely range we are not being aggressive with the way we are looking at the pro forma forecast of the business it does and youve got to remember we have certain assets hanging out there the florida mall is a good example we are all ready we were able to monetize part of it we sold an out parcel of the mall which will actually help the value of the mall because it’s for residential development in that marketplace so it actually increases the value we believe of the sale our marketing assessment of the property does forecast a gain on that property we don’t know if that will actually happen of course but that’s also another source of net income potential in the numbers that would be additive and we also budget ourselves without interest rate increases so when we do our pro forma budget we don’t really impact the run rate based on interest rate increases those interest rate increases are having an impact and as our loans reprice will have a greater impact because we have lot of variable rate loans and security by the way so there is lot of tailwinds that if they play out with any reasonable modeler would expect them to play out we should be in the comfortable range of  plus within the next two quarters frank schiraldi okay i guess just thinking about the  is there a time period in which you have to you know you want to get or you have to get to that number and if you don’t internally then you look externally no damian kozlowski no we are in discussions with the many parties that regulate the bank weve proposed we give them very very detailed information around our business plan and our capital plan at the current time i don’t want to disclose anything too much but i think people are generally this could change tomorrow of course but people are generally pleased with the progress we’ve made to derisk the bank so how do we derisk the bank well part of it is accretion of capital through restructuring the business to create earnings but they are also looking at the sources of risk that might have been viewed previously as sources of volatility and we are talking about the things we did and discontinued in walnut street to make sure that future earnings weren’t impacted so there has been a program here to  within this time last year if you look at the bank there is lot of sources for example discontinued is down  at assets levels we’ve strengthen the credit risk management practices of the banks and we have a pretty sizable initiative to have an integrated compliance plan done by the end of the second quarter which will change our compliance operating environment substantially and we are making great progress on the findings of our regulators in closing out those and validating those issues so you know it’s not one area of risk we are trying to hit every area of risk of the bank and that’s really colors the view of any regulator as to whether or not you have sufficient capital and a plan to have sufficient capital they agree with our capital minimum and they i think they believe so i can’t really speak for them but i believe right now we are all on the same page as to how do we grow the tier  remember riskbased capital isn’t a problem it is tier  capital and get it to the right level by the end of the year frank schiraldi right and that  million valuation allowance would help a lot i guess what is it like  basis points but… damian kozlowski yes frank schiraldi so i guess on that allowance i wonder and i don’t know how to get to it but in terms of being able to get that off in the coming quarters particularly i will reverse that i should say in the coming quarters it seems to me like an issue is not only going to be the number of positive operating quarter you know operating earnings quarter you are able to put up but also the fact that if you look over the last two or three years there is this still coming a flip june losses because of some of the march youve taken on discontinued ops book so is that going to be an issue or if you could just may be walk through a couple of the triggers paul frenkiel it’s actually a forwardlooking analysis so because the bank has strong quarter earnings and that’s demonstrable and we will have two quarters of validated budget that earnings projections the analysis is looking forward to several periods so if you look our budget our projections will be able to use the accumulated the deferred tax assets then nol carryovers in a very short period of time so while it’s prudent to wait a quarter or two i don’t see anything standing in the way of taking those later in the year and that’s been baked into our planning damian kozlowski yes once again we provide pro forma forecasted budget and we’ve exceeded that where we thought we would be and it’s happening on both sides of the table we are continuing with the revenue momentum our balance sheet businesses are growing nicely you have the tailwind of the interest rate increase that really fundamentally changes we are an asset sensitive bank we are probably one of the most asset sensitive banks in the united states and all those things combine to give a very positive pro forma outlook for the company especially look you can’t control revenue all the time but you can control expense and we are only half way done with the process right so we did people we are half way done with the   done with the operating cost reduction and then we are not even started on the reengineering which will happen at the end there will be additional sales with that process to an much more efficient company so you know there is lot on the table for the next  months to two years around being able to maintain and reduce our cost base and actually be more productive frank schiraldi okay so and i guess the accounts so you’ve gotten feedback from the accounts on that that its really just forward looking and it seems like if it all goes according to plan a couple of one or two quarters and youll be able to reverse so thats damian kozlowski yes there is – for every accounting firm theres a different way to handle the evaluation of the deferred tax assets this is a this is truly an art form and its always a collective determination of multiple parties as to what exactly do you do and when and you know weve had a dramatic change theres been three years of pretty poor profitability of the company and if you  this quarter was exceedingly positive and so people are guarded as to they want to see more obviously and we do too so even if you think about the tier i leverage ratio we did we do have the federal tax in there but if you back the federal tax out and we actually realized net income of  a share instead of  a share well our tier i leverage ratio wouldnt even deteriorated in the first quarter and by the way that never has happened in the history of bancorp since its inception i haven’t been here the whole time but im pretty sure thats true and that’s an incredibly positive sign its also a positive sign that we did have some changes and programs and there was a sale of a major client where we transferred the account and the organic growth in the gdp was able to cover that so there its not just the lending business is growing its just not the interest rate its just not the cost reduction its all the things working together to improve the forward looking profitability i mean we werent in any shape and form june of this year we had all this stuff to accomplish all these assets that we werent really productive to get rid of and the environment has changed a lot since that the macro environment so all those things go into the pro forma forecast and thats how you at the end of the day rate whether or not that valuation and allowance will be reversed frank schiraldi okay and then just in terms of if credit of the discontinued ops book and walnut street is there any update you can give in terms of current versus delinquencies any migration within those portfolios in the quarter in q and any negative migration paul frenkiel yes there hasn’t really been any negative migration the big story this quarter was that we moved and frank ill direct you i added some new charts pursuant to your request from prior quarters i added a couple more so you can see the graphically the nonperforming loans and you compare it to the last quarter and so forth the big  so there was no big migration except for the mall that we took into oreo which is a big positive because we cant be sure of the timing but it should sell later this year there should be a recovery its right now a noninterest earning asset so damian kozlowski and its not a drag on  the mall has not been a drag on earnings we now have somebody in place running the mall and it wont be  if anything itll be a slight positive even if we retain the mall it won’t be at a big loss say were not losing  million or  million a year operating it it is actually operating at a gain now so whether we sell it or not which we believe we will it wont hurt it will hurt the company for us running the mall we have professional management in there who are running it frank schiraldi okay so its not a drag on our earnings running it right now paul frenkiel no actually if anything its going to be  million to  million profit from running that mall frank schiraldi okay thats not a bad return actually paul frenkiel we were very aggressive to hang on to it damian kozlowski frank weve been very very aggressive and proper under the gaap rules of course to this this theres been volatility in the earnings of this bank and weve been very focused on reducing derisking and decreasing the earnings volatility of the bank and the only way to do that is to make sure you put the processes in place for walnut street weve talked about this theres weve put three lines of credit with discontinued ops this is an extremely tightly managed process now where weve got the full participation of all the constituents here at bancorp and were going to were going to work out of the portfolio as quickly as possible were already down  yearoveryear a lot of that has happened since june including a  million sale that went that actually had a gain in it so i think we’ve got visibility we want to continue to do the same things so we want to this time next year hopefully we are down another   in that portfolio i believe we will be and as the walnut street security amortizes once again weve built in discount rates so forget all our cash flows back that we anticipate on that we will actually have gains in there so – we  i think we have done everything possible under the rules that are set out by gaap to contain the risks of the banks and get out of those things that might cause future look at this europe it’s not there right hsa it’s not there you have a lot of other activity where we simply not  were not  like cmbs is in the us right were not there anymore thats probably the risky part of the securitization market so a lot of these things have been done purposely to lower the volatility of earnings and lower the risk profile of the bank frank schiraldi okay okay last question just in terms of on the credit side so obviously youre down  yearoveryear you would be hopeful or you would expect that maybe down  to  with runoff and of course youre always looking to sell pieces of this but is there anything on the immediate horizon there you see kind of bulky that you think you might be looking at selling that might be close to just moving a large chunk or a larger sized chunk off in the coming months damian kozlowski we’re very active talking to people across a broad spectrum of partners from the investment banks to investment firms around this disposition of those assets right whenever you have a unique portfolio even if its marked correctly that is the mark of the value of the loan over time so to dispose of the entire portfolio you might have to take a substantial loss and that wouldnt be prudent for investors because that would be wasting value for them so if we do get an opportunity to sell one or two that we dont we dont have anything on the horizon for next quarter i dont believe but were actively managing that portfolio in the sale category too and as you know last quarter we did have a sale so we dont have anything on horizon for the next quarter though frank schiraldi i appreciate it thanks thanks guys damian kozlowski thank you very much frank operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew breese of piper jaffray your line is now open matthew breese good morning guys damian kozlowski good morning matt matthew breese just wanted to follow up on the mall comment and just wanted to get a sense for thinking about discontinued operations in walnut street what is your other exposure to big box retail mall strip mall some of the riskier retail asset classes paul frenkiel yes so that really was the big one if you look at the charts we have a chart that gives the composition at the end of the press release so that will give you the information its a new table that gives you the type of collateral so you can refer to that matthew matthew breese okay so the nonowner occupied retail we should assume thats kind of mall properties paul frenkiel yes but we do start exposure so we have many we dont really have anything that large i mean the mall was basically it we do have some other large exposures but no other malls that are comparable to the risk that we had in the florida mall matthew breese got it okay and then geographically the discontinued operations the  million of it just thinking of it where it is across the country is it pretty widespread or is it most of it in your core markets paul frenkiel the majority the florida mall was an outlier the majority is pennsylvania new jersey damian kozlowski yes it was a community banking portfolio really and it was a very generalized one so it was  a lot of different unique assets and it was generated from the delaware philadelphia area thats where the originators were and then theres as always in this area theres always a connection to florida theres like all the states between they dont even exist people only fly over them nobody drives through and they only fly over them so thats why theres florida properties and stuff in there and then with the mall leaving the greatest source of risk is obviously that was a number one risky retail property by far we were aggressive making sure that was resolved and look we got it the sponsor declared bankruptcy and we got everything back very very quickly that was by far the best interest of the shareholders and of the banks stability and now we get to be able to monetize that and hopefully for a gain matthew breese understood and then damian in the past you suggested how quickly and to what level you think you can reduce the discontinued ops could you update us on what your projections are there damian kozlowski its the same thing you know you want to  we now want to reduce it by  over the next year or  months right so if i  look to be honest if we get  per year from now its in that   range that would be fantastic with it being about  in the  months thats kind of the minimal we want to see some of these loans have natural terminations so that we know when theyre going to we have a few chunky loans i believe the top eight loans in discontinued is like half or so right so its in that range so theres some chunky ones in there that we dont have anything right now that would be this mall like they are  we have great visibility to it some of these are just performing loans and they have termination dates and they will terminate over the next couple of years and theyll be gone and theyll be at other banks and some of these loans weve had actually participated out to other banks so there are some bonafide sponsors in here that you actually could up some of the paper to other banks who are interested in having them as clients so i think we its very tightly managed the risk is down substantially from where we were just considering the marks over the last six months and what weve done around credit defence and then visibility to these assets through tight governance and management i think a  minimum  over a year but hopefully  matthew breese okay and then i wanted to get a sense for your loan growth outlook for the remainder of the year where we continue to see the security portfolio come down a loan growth and then secondly on the auto fleet leasing segment can you talk about some of the protections you have in place in that portfolio and given some of the auto headlines which have been the negative can you talk about lower used car prices and lower residual values are those risk factors to you in that portfolio damian kozlowski well the outlook for the lending business is very positive right so we have a very strong pipelines and it should grow show positive momentum because were growing the balance sheets and the businesses are fairly low risk compared to you know were not growing commercial real estate portfolios so i think we have good positions in these businesses we have a national sba platform where we were doing a lot of franchise lending now were doing a very diverse business with our new leader jeff nager who came to us when i started the business excuse me when i came to this business i didn’t start it obviously but and so what were going to do is see that momentum were doing things in our sbloc business we think well continue to increase the volumes in a very very low risk business as for the auto business once again were not lending or leasing autos to individuals  of the business is to high credit rated government agencies and municipalities so every  usually aa aaa municipalities that need very small part of their budget for vehicles thats  of the business it could be a big government agency too like a part of the military and sometimes they dont pay on time but they always pay so sometimes their delinquencies will grow up a little bit thats usually a municipality that has decided that they are not going to pay us for three weeks because they have to pay their teachers or something but they always pay so they are very low credit risk the other side of business is corporate so we do full underwriting as were lending them the money but its fully securitized against the title of the car the history of the leasing business is we have a little bit of extra coverage because in many of our clients situations were wholesaling were a registered dealer and in florida so were wholesaling cars and then that margin is being built in at the end of day in some cases to the just a slight air ball you might have as in any equipment lease thats the difference between the value and the amount of amortization and lease before you get to the disposal value and historically weve had about a  million gain yearly on the residual value when we sell vehicles and we have a very broad process through auctioning and through connections into the used car market that makes that possible so i feel extreme  if this was a business where were doing personal leases to individuals its a very different business and in many cases we even tailor the cars so were putting the for a police car say were putting the sticker on it and the gun holster and all those things that that police car needs so its a tailored business another thing to say that because its a lot of specialty cars theres a couple of things that happen there is a broad market some municipalities and people only buy used cars and only some buy new cars so there is a very very broad market for these products and they historically have had no trouble disposing of them at a slight gain so we feel fairly comfortable with the fleets that we have and remember in many cases were underwriting the entity which might be a government or a corporate we have collateral thats a car but that doesnt mean theyre not on the hook theyre still on the hook for any loss so were in a very good position and weve had very few losses in that business matthew breese so what is your overall percentage of the municipalities and corporate is it nearly damian kozlowski  i think its a little bit higher now but its around  is municipality government agencies federal government and then  you have quasi there is a lot of quasi organizations i would say there are almost agency government like for example like an nra ph or something that would have a huge budget and but the pure corporate is probably   municipalities and government and then the  are very large organizations that lease cars that aren’t really corporate but theyre not really government either matthew breese understood okay very helpful and then going to the prepaid card business can you give us an update there and the outlook for gross dollar volume on those prepaid cards it sounded like theres a couple of entities that might have shut down so i just wanted to get a sense for damian kozlowski yes we have two programs from major providers they decided to for their own business reasons to close them down and then we had one big sale of a client so they took that volume in house and there was a smaller one that sold that wasnt as dramatic but when you look at our gdv of our base business it made up for all that activity which was very encouraging internally we were hoping that that would happen would we be surprised if we were down a couple million in the first quarter for fees in that space we wouldn’t have been surprised so our team has done a wonderful job replacing that revenue with organic growth i think the prospects for that business now that we were through this little dislocation it just happened to happen now are very good for the rest of the year for gdv growth consistent with this for the base business consistent there will be some over and  yearoveryear impact because weve lost some stuff but the gdv of the base business new clients et cetera should as we go through the year be shown to be true as the numbers continue to move in the right direction matthew breese i think in that past you mentioned high single maybe low doubledigit gdv growth is that still good damian kozlowski yes i mean that’s consistent thats the past right thats where weve been yearover –year it jumps up and down depending on the quarter and everything we dont think there is anything whats happening in the market is volume is consolidating to the few top providers i think as were stronger institution were we did not have a good time over the last three years as were stronger institution and close out our regulatory issues but also appear to be a stronger player i think that will support historical volumes matthew breese okay and maybe hop into the margin what is the outlook for the nim i think in the past you noted that could expand towards  by the end of the year do you still feel like thats thats a reasonable goal paul frenkiel certainly the increases in the interest rates with consensus will help us get there we dont actually predict that there are some dynamics the highest yielding assets we have are the leasing and the sba loans if you go to sblocs the yield somewhat less so it depends somewhat on the mix of those were hopeful that we can continue the leasing growth and the sba under the leadership of jeff nager our new leasing head of leasing we are hopeful that those two will help push continue to push up the net interest margin matthew breese okay whats a good tax rate from here should we keep this  for next quarter or… paul frenkiel yes i think the way the way from a modelling point of view is keep that rate in place more likely than not the reversal of the valuation allowance will be the  all of it or the majority of it and in one quarter so i think thats a fair way plus it in terms of really understanding the profitability right now thats what were looking at we dont really have a big municipal portfolio as we had in the past obviously given the political climate and some possibility of a lower tax rate were probably not going to do anything in that area until that settles out so i think thats the best way of looking at it matthew breese go ahead damian i’m sorry damian kozlowski no when you look at our website we said the near term goal for this year was to get at least  roe and  basis point roa so were going to update that presentation as we go through the year right now we clearly have beaten that and we think we do have the economics to potentially be higher than obviously with onetime gains thats off the table obviously we will exceed that without onetime gains we still have the operating performance here that would exceed that substantially and when we did that  we did a tax effect and so we put that  in for our own planning we just assumed we paid tax so i think that the outlook is good for the company matthew breese right okay and then just one final one the sale of the european operation sounds like a   million gain there and largely offset by the hsa is that to say that the sale of the hsa i’m sorry is that to say the gain on the hsa is  to  million as well damian kozlowski yes matthew breese okay paul frenkiel it should be a total of around  million and it will be monetized probably twothirds or more this quarter and then the rest of it in the next quarter damian kozlowski but that will offset the any restructure we dont know exactly what that restructuring charge and how it will be taken for the european sales but were working on that now but its in the same range so they basically offset each other and so the operating performance should come through matthew breese that’s all i had thank you paul frenkiel where did you get the gain damian kozlowski by the way you get at least  of lowering of expenses too i mean that’s  of a loss so thats after the revenue adjustments so that at least  that european expense will be reduced by the fact that theres  less expenses in this quarter and that will continue forever so the payback on the sale of that thing getting a final deal that was the right thing for that company too it survived by the way its not closed down theres a purchaser you know when i go through regulatory approval we made sure it was capitalized correctly with both our own funds and the funds of the purchaser so were really there are three or more clients in there that we wanted to make sure that were taken care of and we want to make sure we were a good partner to our friends in europe and we want to make sure the fed who govern that business from a regulator point of view were happy and we had everything we wanted to we limited the losses we got a great future for that company and we also get the expense saves in the future so were very happy how it turned out matthew breese understood all right thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of william wallace of raymond james your line is now open william wallace thanks guys just one followup question on the credit side just looking at the nonaccruals on the continuing portfolio they seemed to have jumped up in the first quarter im just wondering if you could talk a bit about what drove that paul frenkiel yes we had some increases in the nonaccruals primarily in sbas so we did have a little bit of an uptick there were monitoring that portfolio very carefully damian kozlowski we dont think will continue next couple quarters weve started a process through all the businesses to look at portfolio review in a more tighter way and so jeff who has led that effort who came in june we did have a lot of franchise based loans historically and so were diversifying that business and so we just wanted to make sure we dont think that trend will continue we dont think theres big numbers going to pop but that was around a little bit of a cleanup of not that it should have been taken in previous quarters but thats just the result of as weve gotten a tighter i think around the credit mismanagement process there was a little bit of a make sure that there were the right credit ratings on the broad portfolio so its a little bit if you look at our metrics generally you have to takeout discontinued our metrics are extremely attractive and if you take our commercial loan if you look at our a lll and you take out obviously its not the discontinued is not in there but if you just look at the commercial activities our reserve is over  its very comparable to our competitors around  obviously the sbloc  businesses like the sbloc business have no losses historically due to the fact that we have  billion of collateral and  million of outstanding its almost the market has to totally melt down to a ridiculous level but we feel good about where we are in the credit risk management and as good as we can feel about things at our discontinued portfolio we think we have done a lot of good work we dont think theres going to be big hits it looks like some gains in the future for us so were – there was a lot of work i will be honest with you and there always is in these situations its a lot of work to reduce expenses its a lot of work from our businesses to create revenue so theres a lot the team has done a great job i think to change performance for the company william wallace thanks and damian you mentioned kind of a target range of  to  production in the discontinued portfolio for the year do you think that is the walnut street is that going to be a longer dated asset or do you think that that you know the work out of that or they wont damian kozlowski yes the walnut street is different paul frenkiel yes walnut street is different it’s actually we’re not in control of walnut street it was actually a true sale that said over the next few years so were not going to have like at the end of next year we cant really predict or set a goal but if you look at the maturities over the next  of the loans over the next several years i think its going to pay down on its own and if you look at the makeup of it only about  is nonperforming it was marked independently and so forth the rest of it is performing and so as damian said weve taken we did three things we made sure that the loans were marked down its in nonaccrual and accounting actually requires you to discount it so weve got a lot of protection in there so in the same way that we think weve done everything possible to reduce volatility in the discontinued operations we feel the same way about walnut street william wallace okay thanks paul and then just one last question on the tax rate so paul you suggested that after even after recovery the valuation allowance you still think a  tax rate is the rate to model and then if theres any kind of tax reform you will at that point decide whether or not to invest in municipals or whatever it seems paul frenkiel yes its interesting so what happens if theres tax reform that changes the whole picture because all your deferred tax assets get revalued so theres actually an accounting implication but its significantly offset by the fact that instead of  federal rate you go to  so longterm let’s say that tax bill get passed banks will be significantly better off that in essence returns into its bottom line it increases returns to shareholders by  doing nothing so that would change it but so well have to be careful well have to watch the political environment and so forth but historically the bank and other banks with the highest yielding portfolios in those tax rates investing heavily in municipals we had a fairly big one of the biggest in the country actually portfolios so we are watching that so that’s a possibility for the future william wallace right so the problem is if there is tax reform and the corporate rate goes to i mean  then youve got if you recover the dta you actually didn’t have to write it back down damian kozlowski exactly william wallace right so if i look at the  million balance that’s reported in the press release on the balance sheet for net deferred tax asset and i add say  million to that if the tax rate is reduced from  to  i would then write down that  million by the corresponding percentage is that the right way to think about it paul frenkiel exactly that’s exactly you defined the percentage tax rate damian kozlowski regardless of the accounting reducing the taxes by that amount is economic its unbelivable… william wallace well i agree i agree damian kozlowski you will be determining how much you want to increase the earnings of the bank rather the vise versa william wallace right and so… paul frenkiel okay so what’s going to happen nobody is going to buy municipal bonds because there is such limited taxes it’s going to be very difficult tax bill to pass because all the municipalities that’s what they live off of is what in essence is the subsidy so that’s going to be a difficult constituency to overcome william wallace right and then damian early in the conversation you said there is not you don’t have a specific time line to achieve the  leverage with the regulators damian kozlowski no no i miss spoke we think we will be this is my definitive statement william wallace okay damian kozlowski i think we can make it a case a most likely case that  will happen somewhere between the second and third quarter based on all the things we know i could be wrong but based on the profitability and the other things like the dtas and stuff if the world stays the way it is without additional interest rate cuts and all increases and stuff we should be able to get in that range by somewhere between the second and third quarter we do have visibility and we will be close to if not at the  level if that’s true the  level will come at the close to the yearend or in the first quarter of next year but there are scenarios that are clearly would get us to the  very quickly depending on the disposition of assets and things so we feel i think everyone like i said before i think the constituencies involved feel comfortable with continued performance that we can close that gap pretty quickly and get to that capital minimum long term i want to be more than  so i want to be in the  plus level the  low  level at least longterm you know it doesn’t mean we always will be there we may have a bump in the first quarter due to the reasons we said but you know that’s kind of the range were thinking longer term and that should happen over the year so next year right william wallace okay thank you damian i appreciate you guys thanks for all the time damian kozlowski very welcome wally operator thank you that is all the time we have for questions i’d like to hand the call back over to
