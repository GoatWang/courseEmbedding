initiatives that humana the billion healthcare insurance provider has launched in its ongoing focus on customer experience driven by technology humana like its major competitors in the healthcare space have faced monumental challenges in recent years as both current and potential customers have begun demanding that their providers offer services that mirror the technology they use in their personal lives  related at humana it augments the human touch for leclaire the strategic shift is all about staying relevant not only in terms of delivering on customers’ expectations but also in ensuring that his organization is harnessing the best technologies to do so“the challenge to enterpriseclass it organizations in terms of their relevance and value has never been greater than it is today” leclaire says the challenge is driven largely by the adoption of consumer technologies he continued and keeping up with the latest innovations is more than most it leaders and their organizations can handle “the more they struggle they keep up the more that they’re going to be questioned about their relevance and the more they’re going to be relegated to performing more tactical things for the company”whether or not they say it directly relevance is a top priority for all cios today — and also one of their biggest concerns it’s been a driving force for leclaire ever since he had a unique transition into the corporate world in today’s cio universe we talk so much about the “hybrid” cio — the it leader who balances technology smarts with business acumen to best deliver real results for their businesses but we still face the daunting challenge that not all cios are created equal particularly in that so many cios boast different backgrounds in education work experience and leadership philosophiesleclaire is something of an outlier — and that might have made all the differenceunconventional path to cio role humana humana cio brian leclaire as a college freshman leclaire set a goal of earning a phd immediately after graduating with a degree in psychology and a teaching certification leclaire headed to business school he was certified to teach but he wanted to keep his options openas leclaire earned his mba with an emphasis on accounting he picked up an interest in technology then came a phd in management information systems with an emphasis on qualitative analysis and a doctoral minor in computer sciencefrom there leclaire connected his academic pedigrees and began teaching at the wisconsin school of business at the university of wisconsin one of his areas of focus was a conceptual model for decisionsupport systems based on objectoriented technology before long a student asked leclaire to consult his company on an objectoriented implementation and leclaire joined the legion of academics who took on consulting work as a side gigbut it would become much more his consulting work gave him “a fire in the belly” to get into the business world leclaire soon made the lessusual leap from academics to industry joining prudential as an it manager it was in that role that he discovered the importance of relevance — in this case for his careerat the time the company had a management hierarchy largely grown internally so as an outsider leclaire had to quickly learn the landscape and demonstrate his value “for me it was really about how you remain relevant and keep your skillsets marketable both internally and externally because at the end of the day all management abhors a vacuum and has challenges that need to be solved” he said it project success rates finally improving “if you are someone who can do that you are going to grow your career”clearly leclaire did he eventually worked directly for the cio of prudential bank who left the company for alltel and recruited leclaire to join him at alltel he initially led the architecture side of the organization but later was promoted to oversee all product and development for the software sideyet another former colleague from prudential called inviting leclaire to join him at humana in  since then leclaire has held three different clevel titles at the health insurer cto chief service officer and his current title cio which he has held since january leclaire says his current role came about as the thennew ceo bruce broussard “wanted to make sure we brought technology up and out broadly across the company” leclaire shifted from reporting to the coo to broussardand the shift came with a mandate    driving strategic goalsas leclaire noted consumer technology use has had a dramatic impact on the way healthcare executives have strategized their interactions with customers partners and providers he noted that his discussions with his board of directors first and foremost have to do with aligning with the company’s overall strategy—in it terms that means reaching customers in ways they want to be reached in line with that cybersecurity is key concern which forces leclaire and his teams to consider how they protect those customer interactions related it industry innovation health health care cio role it leadership   page  next new download the state of the cio  report you
