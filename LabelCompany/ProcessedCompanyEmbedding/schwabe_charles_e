jd power ratings for additional jd power ratings data please visit wwwjdpowercomcars and wwwjdpowercomratings  back charles schwab  co inc ranks highest in full service investor satisfaction for second consecutive year costa mesa calif  april  — emerging affluent investors—defined as millennials with  in investable assets—currently control the largest portion of atrisk assets managed by full service financial advisors according to the jd power  us full service investor satisfaction studysm released today surprisingly half  of emerging affluent investors currently working with an advisor say they “probably will” or “definitely will” leave their current firm compared with just  among all other generations of investors wealth managers have been slow to focus on millennials because they don’t yet have the assets boomers do but when looking at potential money in motion—even in the short term—the picture looks quite different said mike foy director of the wealth management practice at jd power with the emergence of roboadvisors and selfdirected platforms investors have more options than ever both within and outside the traditional fullservice channelthe study captures the clearest evidence to date of a historic generational shift that is currently unfolding in the wealth management space noting distinct differences between millennials and other generational groups on indicators such as overall satisfaction economic outlook advisor and firm loyalty and advocacyreferrals this year’s study suggests that advisory firms will need to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of this growing customer basefollowing are some of the key generational findings in the studymillennial money in motion an alarming  of emerging affluent millennials indicate they will definitely or probably leave their current provider in the next  months versus only  of other investors while emerging affluent millennials still represent just  of the overall available investable asset pool they represent  of assets held by investors who are currently at risk of leaving their current investment firmevolving investor needs today just  of full service investors have a documented financial plan and while those plans generally address retirement planning these investors are much less likely to feel they are addressing other financial goals that are a higher priority for millennials eg major purchase or education planning or for boomers who are leaving the work force eg capital preservation or estate planningbrave new world of referrals the firms that are able to create loyalty among millennial clients today can expect significant ongoing rewards among those clients identified as highly likely to recommend millennials made more positive recommendations during the past  months an average of  per client than did boomers  per client and gen x  per client combined but advisors and firms need to actively cultivate this referral source millennials indicated they would be more likely to provide referrals if their advisor asked  or they were incentivized to do so risk of channel defection onefourth  of fullservice millennial investors have either tried or are actively using a roboadvisor platform and  of them rate their satisfaction with this platform higher than for their fullservice firm also more than onethird  have a secondary selfdirected account suggesting a flexibility and openness to a variety of service models not exhibited by investors in other generational groups study rankingscharles schwab  co inc  ranks highest in overall investor satisfaction for
