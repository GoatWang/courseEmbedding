various continents about us flir was established in  to pioneer the development of highperformance lowcost infrared thermal imaging systems for airborne applications thermal imaging systems detect the infrared energy heat that is emitted by all people objects and materials infrared cameras allow the operator to see in total darkness adverse weather and through such air pollutants as smoke and haze toward the end of the s flir began to leverage its experience in infrared imaging technology to develop handheld and laboratory systems for a variety of commercial applications that required not only superior image quality but also the ability to detect and measure temperature differences this effort accelerated with the acquisition of the industrial infrared imaging group from the hughes aircraft co in  the acquisition of agema sweden in  and of inframetrics boston ma in mid provided flir engineering teams and sales and support infrastructure that accelerated flir’s success in commercial thermal imaging markets together agema and inframetrics represented over  years of significant infrared camera development and thermography applications expertise agema developed the first commercial infrared scanner designed for powerline inspections in  the first batteryoperated portable infrared scanner in  the first dualwavelength system capable of realtime analog recording for rd markets in  and the first uncooled infrared camera the agema  and  inframetrics also a pioneer in commercial infrared cameras and thermography training developed the first tvcompatible infrared system in  and the first fullfeatured camcorderstyle focal plane array fpa infrared camera in  in  flir acquired indigo systems a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors camera cores and finished cameras ever since flir has invested in numerous adjacent markets technologies and products to expand its sensor solution set and its ability to service a broader set of customers these investments have enabled significant growth in revenue and unit volumes which has helped reduce the cost and thus end user prices of the products

various continents about us flir was established in  to pioneer the development of highperformance lowcost infrared thermal imaging systems for airborne applications thermal imaging systems detect the infrared energy heat that is emitted by all people objects and materials infrared cameras allow the operator to see in total darkness adverse weather and through such air pollutants as smoke and haze toward the end of the s flir began to leverage its experience in infrared imaging technology to develop handheld and laboratory systems for a variety of commercial applications that required not only superior image quality but also the ability to detect and measure temperature differences this effort accelerated with the acquisition of the industrial infrared imaging group from the hughes aircraft co in  the acquisition of agema sweden in  and of inframetrics boston ma in mid provided flir engineering teams and sales and support infrastructure that accelerated flir’s success in commercial thermal imaging markets together agema and inframetrics represented over  years of significant infrared camera development and thermography applications expertise agema developed the first commercial infrared scanner designed for powerline inspections in  the first batteryoperated portable infrared scanner in  the first dualwavelength system capable of realtime analog recording for rd markets in  and the first uncooled infrared camera the agema  and  inframetrics also a pioneer in commercial infrared cameras and thermography training developed the first tvcompatible infrared system in  and the first fullfeatured camcorderstyle focal plane array fpa infrared camera in  in  flir acquired indigo systems a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors camera cores and finished cameras ever since flir has invested in numerous adjacent markets technologies and products to expand its sensor solution set and its
