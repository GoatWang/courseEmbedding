electronic format start preamble november   pursuant to section b  of the securities exchange act of  the “act”  and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on october   nyse mkt llc the “exchange” or “nyse mkt” filed with the securities and exchange commission the “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i ii and iii below which items have been prepared by the selfregulatory organization the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange proposes to discontinue the nyse mkt realtime reference price “nyse mkt rrp” market data product offering the text of the proposed rule change is available on the exchanges web site at wwwnysecom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the selfregulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and the statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose in  the securities and exchange commission “commission” approved the nyse mkt rrp market data product and certain fees for it the nyse mkt rrp market data product provides on a realtime basis last sale prices in all securities that trade on the exchange currently there are no subscribers to the nyse mkt rrp market data product therefore the exchange has determined to discontinue the nyse mkt rrp market data product the exchange also proposes to update the fee schedule to remove reference to the nyse mkt rrp in connection with this change the exchange will announce the date that the nyse mkt rrp will be decommissioned via an nyse market data notice  statutory basis the proposed rule change is consistent with section b  of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b  of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the exchange believes that discontinuing nyse mkt rrp and removing it from the fee schedule would remove impediments to and perfect a free and open market by streamlining the exchanges market data product offerings to include those for which there has been more demand and would provide vendors and subscribers with a simpler and more standardized suite of market data products the proposal to discontinue nyse mkt rrp is applicable to all members issuers and other persons and does not unfairly discriminate between customers issuers brokers or dealers in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations “sros” and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the commission concluded that regulation nms—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the acts goals of facilitating efficiency and competition efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data the commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data start printed page  the exchange believes that the discontinuation of a market data product for which there is little or no demand as is the case with nyse mkt rrp is a direct example of efficiency because it acknowledges that investors and the public have indicated that they have little or no use for certain information and allows the exchange to dedicate resources to developing products including through innovations of existing products and entirely new products that provide information for which there is more of an expressed need b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition in accordance with section b of the act the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which other exchanges are free to offer similar products additionally since there has been little or no demand for the nyse mkt rrp product the exchanges proposed discontinuance will not harm competition c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others no written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action because the foregoing proposed rule does not i significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest ii impose any significant burden on competition and iii become operative for  days from the date on which it was filed or such shorter time as the commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest provided that the selfregulatory organization has given the commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change or such shorter time as designated by the commission the proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to section ba of the act  and rule bf thereunder at any time within  days of the filing of such proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act if the commission takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings under section bb  of the act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved a proposed rule change filed under rule bf  normally does not become operative prior to  days after the date of the filing however pursuant to rule bfiii the commission may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest the exchange has asked the commission to waive the day operative because it believes that immediate operation of this filing would not impact any users of nyse mkt rrp the commission noting that there are currently no subscribers to these data services finds that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest to waive the day operative date and to permit the proposal to be operative upon filing iv solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to submit written data views and arguments concerning the foregoing including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the act comments may be submitted by any of the following methods electronic comments use the commissions internet comment form httpwwwsecgov​rules​sroshtml
