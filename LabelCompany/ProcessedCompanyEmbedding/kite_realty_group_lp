and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and item a risk factors appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k in this discussion unless the context suggests otherwise references to our company we us and our mean kite realty group trust and its direct and indirect subsidiaries including kite realty group lp overview in the following overview we discuss among other things the status of our business and properties the effect that current united states economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us and the current state of the financial markets and how it impacts our financing strategy our business and properties kite realty group trust is a publiclyheld real estate investment trust which through its majorityowned subsidiary kite realty group lp owns interests in various operating subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the ownership operation acquisition development and redevelopment of highquality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the united states we derive revenues primarily from activities associated with the collection of contractual rents and reimbursement payments from tenants at our properties our operating results therefore depend materially on among other things the ability of our tenants to make required lease payments the health and resilience of the united states retail sector interest rate volatility job growth and overall economic and real estate market conditions as of december   we owned interests in  operating and redevelopment properties consisting of  retail properties nine retail redevelopment properties one office operating property and an associated parking garage we also owned two development projects under construction as of this date portfolio update in evaluating acquisition development and redevelopment opportunities we look for strong submarkets where average household income is above the broader market average we also focus on locations with population density high traffic counts and strong daytime workforce populations household incomes in our largest submarkets are significantly higher than the medians for those broader markets in  we transitioned the holly springs towne center  phase ii and tamiami crossing development projects to the operating portfolio we also began construction on our expansion of holly springs  phase ii in the fourth quarter our r initiative which includes a total of  existing and potential projects continued to progress in  ten of these projects are under construction with total estimated costs of  million to  million and estimated combined returns of  to  there are  additional projects under active evaluation with potential estimated costs of  to  million and potential returns of  to  we completed construction on four r projects during the fourth quarter hitchcock plaza shops at moore tarpon bay plaza and traders point in addition to targeting submarkets with strong consumer demographics we focus on having the appropriate tenant mix at each center many of our tenants are serviceoriented or have a prominent online platform that has reduced the impact of the expansion of ecommerce on their operations we have aggressively targeted and executed leases with notable grocers including publix trader joes and aldi along with soft goods retailers such as ross dress for less ulta and nordstrom rack additionally we have identified costefficient ways to optimize space for junior anchors such as rightsizing office supply stores and backfilling the existing space with a tenant more suitable to the larger space in addition many of our redevelopment projects include consolidating small shop space to accommodate construction of new junior anchor space capital and financing activities our ability to obtain capital on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature is affected by the condition of the economy in general and by the financial strength of properties securing borrowings throughout  we strengthened our balance sheet by retiring multiple propertylevel secured loans and unencumbering the related assets securing the loans we increased our liquidity through amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan which allows us the option to increase the borrowing capacity of the unsecured revolving credit facility to  billion and the option to increase our unsecured term loan to provide for an additional  million we also issued  million of notes in a public offering as of december   we have reduced our term maturities through  to approximately  million and extended our weightedaverage debt maturities to  years the amount that we may borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility is limited by the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool as of december   the value of the assets in our unencumbered asset pool was  million taking into account outstanding borrowings and letters of credit we had  million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility for future borrowings as of december   in addition we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   the unencumbering of a number of properties drawing the remaining amount on our year term loan amending our existing unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan and issuing the notes provides us with more flexibility for future capital activity in addition the investment grade credit ratings we received in  provide us with access to the unsecured public bond market which we may continue to use in the future to finance acquisition activity repay debt maturing in the near term and fix interest rates summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective and complex judgments valuation of investment properties management reviews operational and development projects land parcels and intangible assets for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable the review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment impairment losses for investment properties and intangible assets are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset our impairment review for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels if we determine those plans will not be completed or our assumptions with respect to operating assets are not realized an impairment loss may be appropriate depreciation may be accelerated for a redevelopment project including partial demolition of existing structures after the asset is assessed for impairment operating properties will be classified as held for sale only when those properties are available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year among other factors operating properties classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell depreciation and amortization are suspended during the heldforsale period our operating properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities historically the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition in the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of asu  presentation of financial statements topic  and property plant and equipment topic  reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity which will result in fewer real estate sales being classified within discontinued operations as only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations all operating properties included in discontinued operations in  were classified as such prior to the adoption of asu  and no properties that have been sold or designated as heldforsale since the adoption of asu  have met the revised criteria for classification within discontinued operations acquisition of real estate investments upon acquisition of real estate operating properties we estimate the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible assets and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed debt and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date based on these estimates we record the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities in making estimates of fair values a number of sources are utilized including information obtained as a result of preacquisition due diligence marketing and leasing activities the estimates of fair value were determined to have primarily relied upon level  and level  inputs as defined below fair value is determined for tangible assets and intangibles including the fair value of the building on an asifvacant basis and the fair value of land determined either by comparable market data real estate tax assessments independent appraisals or other relevant data abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values for acquired properties which are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii managements estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding inplace leases measured over the remaining noncancelable term of the leases any belowmarket renewal options are also considered in the inplace lease values the capitalized abovemarket and belowmarket lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the term of the lease should a tenant vacate terminate its lease or otherwise notify us of its intent to do so the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income the value of having a lease in place at the acquisition date we utilize independent and internal sources for our estimates to determine the respective inplace lease values our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated leaseup period as if the space was vacant the value of inplace leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases and the fair value of any assumed financing that is determined to be above or below market terms we utilize third party and independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective fair value of each mortgage payable the fair market value of each mortgage payable is amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective loan we also consider whether there is any value to inplace leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value characteristics we consider in determining these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals among other factors to date a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value we finalize the measurement period of our business combinations when all facts and circumstances are understood but in no circumstances will the measurement period exceed one year revenue recognition as a lessor of real estate assets the company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership and account for its leases as operating leases contractual rent percentage rent and expense reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance costs insurance and real estate taxes are our principal sources of revenue base minimum rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the respective leases certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenants sales volume contingent overage rent overage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified sales targets as defined in their lease agreements overage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a result of generating this revenue we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that may affect the collection of outstanding receivables to address the collectability of these receivables we analyze historical writeoff experience tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and straight line rent reserve although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income actual experience may differ from those estimates gains or losses from sales of real estate are recognized when a sale has been consummated the buyers initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the asset we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property as part of our ongoing business strategy we will from time to time sell land parcels and outlots some of which are ground leased to tenants fair value measurements we follow the framework established under accounting standard fasb asc  for measuring fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis but only in certain circumstances such as a business combination or upon determination of impairment assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows level  fair value inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments to which we have access level  fair value inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for similar instruments either directly or indirectly and appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations level  fair value inputs reflect our best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an instrument at the measurement date the inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation estimate in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability as discussed in note  to the financial statements we have determined that its derivative valuations are classified in level  of the fair value hierarchy cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable escrows and deposits and other working capital balances approximate fair value note  to the financial statements includes a discussion of the fair values income taxes and reit compliance parent company the parent company which is considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes has been organized and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will enable it to maintain its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the earnings that it distributes to the extent it distributes its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains to shareholders of the parent company and meets certain other requirements on a recurring basis to the extent that it satisfies this distribution requirement but distributes less than  of its taxable income it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed reit taxable income reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements if the parent company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates for a period of four years following the year in which qualification is lost we may also be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income even if the parent company does qualify as a reit the operating partnership intends to continue to make distributions to the parent company in amounts sufficient to assist the parent company in adhering to reit requirements and maintaining its reit status we have elected to treat kite realty holdings llc as a taxable reit subsidiary of the operating partnership and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future this election enables us to receive income and provide services that would otherwise be impermissible for a reit deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized operating partnership the allocated share of income and loss other than the operations of our taxable reit subsidiary is included in the income tax returns of the operating partnerships partners accordingly the only federal income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are in connection with its taxable reit subsidiary inflation inflation rates have been near historical lows in recent years and therefore have not had a significant impact on our results of operations most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses including common area maintenance real estate taxes and insurance or include a fixed amount for these costs that escalates over time thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation also most of our leases have original terms of fewer than ten years which enables us to adjust rental rates to market upon lease

subsidiary kite realty group lp is engaged in the ownership and operation acquisition development and redevelopment of highquality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the united states we derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under leases at our properties our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments conditions in the united states retail sector and overall economic and real estate market conditions at march   we owned interests in  operating and redevelopment properties consisting of  retail properties one office operating property and an associated parking garage as well as the office components of the eddy street commons and traditions village operating properties and three development properties under construction in addition we also owned interests in other land parcels comprising  acres that may be used for future expansion of

one office operating property and an associated parking garage and four retail properties under redevelopment as of this date we also owned interests in two retail development properties under

hardware operational activities during the first quarter of  we executed  new and renewal leases totaling  square feet we signed comparable new leases with  tenants for  square feet of gross leasable

costs capital activity in march  we amended the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility the amendment provided for the release of the subsidiary guarantees relating to the amended facility in addition we continue to increase the unencumbered property pool including through the retirement of loans secured by indian river and plaza volente in march  the amendment of our credit facilities the achievement of investment grade credit ratings in late  and a continued increase in our unencumbered property pool all provide us with greater financial flexibility and opportunities our investment grade credit ratings provide us with access to the unsecured public bond market which we may use in the future to finance acquisition activity repay debt maturing in the near term and fix interest rates that are currently at historically low levels our same property net operating income increased  for the three months ended march   compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to

performance because it includes only the noi of properties that have been owned for the full period presented which eliminates disparities in net income due to the redevelopment acquisition or

connection with the merger with inland diversified contributed  million of rental income in the current quarter the net increase of  million in rental income from properties sold during  and  is

properties is primarily attributable to an improvement in small shop occupancy and an improvement in expense recoveries from tenants other property related revenue primarily consists of parking

revenue general administrative and other expenses increased  million or  due primarily to higher public company and personnel costs largely associated with the increased size of the company specifically our employee base increased  from  employees as of march   to  employees as of march   merger and acquisition costs in  related almost entirely to our merger with inland diversified and

anchor tenant openings interest expense increased  million or  the increase mainly resulted from our assumption of  million of debt as part of the merger with inland diversified the increase was also due to certain development projects including delray marketplace and parkside town commons  phase i becoming operational as a portion of the project becomes operational we expense prorata amount of related interest expense the allocation to net income of noncontrolling interests increased due to allocations to joint venture partners in certain consolidated properties acquired as part of the merger these partners are allocated income generally equal to the distribution received from the operations of the properties in which they hold an interest liquidity and capital resources overview our primary finance and capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a costeffective manner we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings or equity offerings including the estimated value of properties to be developed or acquired the estimated market value of our properties and the company as a whole upon placement of the borrowing or offering and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover debt service we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares unsecured debt securities preferred shares or other securities our principal capital resources for a discussion of cash generated from operations see cash flows beginning on page  in addition to cash generated from operations we discuss below our other principal capital resources the increased asset base and operating cash flows of the company have substantially enhanced our liquidity position and reduced our borrowing costs we continue to focus on a balanced approach to growth and staggering debt maturities in order to retain our financial flexibility on march   we amended the terms of the fourth amended and restated credit agreement the amended facility the amendment provided for the release of the subsidiary guarantees relating to the amended facility upon the satisfaction of specified conditions the release conditions the amendment also changed the calculation of unsecured debt interest expense which is used for purposes of calculating the unsecured debt interest coverage ratio to be the actual interest expense incurred previously unsecured debt interest expense was the greater of the actual interest expense incurred and an implied expense based on an assumed  interest rate on march   upon satisfaction of the release conditions all of the subsidiary guarantees relating to the amended facility were released as provided in the amended facility if any subsidiary of the operating partnership becomes liable with respect to any unsecured indebtedness that subsidiary is required to become a subsidiary guarantor under the amended facility as of march   we had approximately  million available for future borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition our unencumbered assets could provide approximately  million of additional borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loan as of march   finally we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as of march   this includes approximately  million of cash received from  and  property sales to potentially be utilized for future acquisitions in april  we utilized  million of these proceeds and a draw on our unsecured revolving credit facility to acquire colleyville downs in dallas texas in the future we may raise capital by disposing of properties land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy the sale price may differ from our carrying value at the time of sale we will also continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares preferred shares or other securities we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties therefore our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically investprimarily neighborhood and community shopping centersprovides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times the recent economic downturn adversely affected the ability of some of our tenants to meet their lease obligations our principal liquidity needs shortterm liquidity needs nearterm debt maturities as of march   we had a total of  million of debt scheduled to mature prior to december   excluding scheduled monthly principal payments we have sufficient liquidity to repay these obligations from current resources and capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility but we are also evaluating financing alternatives to enable us to repay these loans other shortterm liquidity needs the nature of our business coupled with the requirements for qualifying for reit status and in order to receive a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends paid to shareholders necessitate that we distribute at least  of our taxable income on an annual basis which will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term our shortterm liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt expected dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders and to common unit holders and recurring capital expenditures in february  our board declared a quarterly cash distribution of  per common share and common unit totaling  million for the quarter ended march   this distribution was paid on april   to common shareholders and common unit holders of record as of april   in february  our board declared a quarterly preferred share cash distribution of  per series a preferred share or  million covering the distribution period from december   to march   payable to shareholders of record as of february   this distribution was paid on march   when we lease space to new tenants or renew leases for existing tenants we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing    aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage  of the best
