the amendments each of which are credit neutral or marginally credit positive incorporated several changes meant to bring the program in compliance with the secs regulation ab ii the changes include the creation of investor communications procedures and enhanced rep and warrant breach review and dispute resolution mechanics following the amendments if an investor makes a request to the servicer or transferor in writing to communicate with another investor the servicer or transferor as applicable must include the request to communicate in the distribution report for the month that the request occurred in addition the pooling and servicing agreement now contains a two step test that will trigger a rep and warrant breach review by a third party the two steps of the test are a a delinquency test which is triggered if the three month average  day delinquency rate exceeds the delinquency trigger rate and b a majority of investors vote in favor of having the review take place the investor vote will only take place if at least  of investors submit a petition within  days of the delinquency trigger breach the pooling and servicing agreement also now contains specific procedures that

series notes deal v compared to credit cards v rating action moodys assigns provisional aaa sf to comet class a card series notes presale report capital one multiasset execution trust comet class a card series notes rating action moodys assigns definitive aaa sf to comet class a card series notes global credit research   aug   million securities rated new york august    moodys investors service has assigned a definitive aaa sf rating to the class a card series notes to be issued by the capital one multiasset execution trust sponsored by capital one bank usa national association capone moodys rating action is as follows issuer comet  capital one multiasset execution trust  cl a  definitive rating assigned aaa sf rating rationale the rating is based on the quality of the underlying credit card receivables the expertise of capone as servicer the transactions legal and structural protections including early amortization trigger events the credit enhancement provided by subordinate notes and the likelihood of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio moodys assesses this likelihood from the sponsors counterparty risk assessment cr assessment the comet class a card series notes have a floating rate coupon of onemonth libor plus  an expected maturity date of  august  and a legal maturity date of  june  moodys rating addresses the likelihood of interest payments being made when due and the return of principal by the legal maturity date the assets of comet consist of a collateral certificate series cc issued by the capital one master trust the master trust representing an undivided interest in the receivables originated and serviced by capone which the master trust holds capones longterm deposit ratings are a stablelongterm senior unsecured baa stable longterm cr assessment acr shortterm deposits p and bca a summary of analytical outputs moodys aaa lgsd and the aaa ce are  and  respectively for this transaction the aaa lgsd reflects moodys expectation of the trusts performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown the aaa ce reflects the level of credit enhancement consistent with a aaa sf rating by haircutting the aaa lgsd based on the cr assessment of the sponsor moodys expects performance in the range of    for chargeoffs    for yield and    for the principal payment rate moodys performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term from time to time moodys may if warranted change these expectations performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had anticipated when the related securities were rated even so a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude such actions the decision to take or not take a rating action is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including but not exclusively the performance metrics methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities published in june  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating moodys could downgrade the rating of the class a card series notes if our expectation of the trusts performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown ie aaa lgsd deteriorates materially specifically if the chargeoff rate rises or the payment rate or yield falls an increase in moodys assessment of the likelihood of either of the sponsors shutting down its credit card portfolio generally reflected from a downgrade in either of the sponsors cr assessment could also lead to a downgrade to the rating of the class a card series notes loss and cash flow analysis  in rating this transaction moodys uses a cash flow model to determine the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario as a second step moodys haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsors credit quality finally moodys compares note available credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses taking into account loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument stress scenarios moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections
