directing the superior court to vacate its ruling denying state farms motion for summary judgment on aegea homeowners association incs aegea complaint for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing breach of statutory duties and breach of contract we conclude summary judgment was improperly denied because state farms insurance policy unambiguously excluded coverage for the losses involved here facts in  aegea purchased an insurance policy from state farm for its condominium complex in oceanside california the policy generally insured against all risks of direct physical loss the policy specifically excluded coverage for loss caused by inherent or latent defect  settling cracking shrinkage bulging or expansion of pavements foundations walls floors roofs or ceilings unless the loss was caused by a peril not otherwise excluded in which case the ensuing loss was covered loss caused by faulty materials or workmanship unless loss by fire or explosion not otherwise excluded ensues in which case the ensuing loss was covered and loss caused by the enforcement of construction codes  the  policy excluded loss caused by inherent vice latent defect and faulty materials or workmanship unless loss by fire smoke  explosion collapse of a building glass breakage or water not otherwise excluded ensues then this policy shall cover only such ensuing loss from  through  the policy in pertinent part stated this policy insures for accidental direct physical loss except as provided in losses not insured      losses not insured  the company does not insure loss either consisting of or directly and immediately caused by one or more of the following       wear and tear marring or scratching  deterioration inherent vice latent defect       the company does not insure for loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events the company does not insure for such loss regardless of whether a peril covered under section   losses insured a is the cause of the excluded event or b is another cause of the loss or c acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss a by enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the construction repair or demolition of buildings or structures       the company does not insure for loss consisting of one or more of the items below a conduct act failure to act or decision of any person group organization or governmental body whether intentional wrongful negligent or without fault  b defect weakness inadequacy fault or unsoundness in ¶  planning zoning development surveying siting ¶  design specifications workmanship construction grading compaction ¶  materials used in construction or repair or ¶  maintenance of any property  on or off the premises however the company does insure for ensuing loss from items a and b unless the ensuing loss is itself a loss not insured by this section in june  aegea made a demand on the policy for  to repair deficiencies in the structures these deficiencies were allegedly due to building code violations faulty workmanship and fraud by the builder they included inadequate fire and earthquakeproofing in june  after state farm had failed to pay or deny the claim aegea sued state farm for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing breach of statutory duties and breach of contract in may  the city of oceanside concerned that the aegea condominiums may have structural and lifesafety deficiencies which could possibly pose a threat to the safety of the occupants sent a letter to aegea noting various deficiencies and required the deficiencies be repaired in a timely manner state farm asserted aegeas losses were not covered by the policy because the policy specifically excluded recovery for latent defects faulty workmanship and construction code violations state farm brought a motion for summary judgment aegea argued the damages to the structures were merely a description of the existing condition of the building and argued the actual loss was the diminished value of the building which was a nonexcluded ensuing loss the trial court accepted aegeas reasoning and denied summary judgment determining there were triable issues as to the magnitude of this diminution in value and as to which elements causing the diminution in value are themselves excluded losses and which are covered consequential results of excluded losses discussion the trial courts determination diminution in value was an ensuing loss distinct from losses due to latent defects faulty workmanship and code violations was based on two cases geddes  smith inc v st paul mercury indemnity co   cal d   pd  geddes and eichler homes inc v underwriters at lloyds london   cal app d   cal rptr  eichler  in the geddes case an insurance policy was issued to a seller of aluminum doors the seller had sold defective doors to a builder who had installed these doors in homes the builder sued the seller for damages to the doors and other property caused by the defective doors the seller tendered the defense to its insurance company which refused to defend the builder obtained a  judgment against the seller who sought that amount from its insurance company the insurance policy in geddes provided the insurance company would pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law or contract because of injury to or destruction of property including the loss of use thereof caused by accident geddes supra  cald at p  the policy did not cover liability for damage to any products sold by the insured after the insured had relinquished possession of the product ibid the insurance company argued it was not liable because there was no accident which caused property damage or destruction and because the policy excluded damage to the doors which had been sold the supreme court held the door failures were unexpected undesigned and unforeseen and therefore were accidents within the meaning of the policy and that the policy covered damages for the diminution of the market value of the houses or the cost of repairing the doors plus the lost use id at pp  the geddes court explained it is not disputed that injury to or destruction of the doors themselves was excluded by exclusion e plaintiff contends however that both the houses and its business were damaged by the door failures with respect to the houses its position is supported by hauenstein v saint paulmercury indem co  minn   nwd  in that case the insured sold defective plaster that was used to plaster a house the plaster shrank and cracked to such an extent that it was of no value and had to be removed so that the walls and ceilings could be replastered with a different material injury to the plaster itself was excluded from coverage the court held however that injury to the house had occurred and was covered under a clause identical with coverage c in the present case no one can reasonably contend that the application of a useless plaster which has to be removed before the walls can be properly replastered does not lower the market value of a building although the injury to the walls and ceilings can be rectified by removal of the defective plaster nevertheless the presence of the defective plaster on the walls and ceilings reduced the value of the building and constituted property damage the measure of damages is the diminution in the market value of the building or  the cost of removing the defective plaster and restoring the building to its former condition plus any loss from deprival of use whichever is lesser  nwd at  in volf v ocean accident  guar corp  cal d   a case also involving defective plaster we distinguished the hauenstein case on the ground that in the volf case it was not necessary to remove the defective plaster before replastering the house in the present case however it was necessary to remove the defective doors before they could be replaced and we see no reason for not following the hauenstein case and permitting recovery for damages to the houses according to the rule stated therein id at pp  italics added in the eichler case homeowners sued a builder for damages caused by the rupture and failure of radiant heating systems the builder tendered defense to its insurance company which refused to defend the builder then sought a declaration from the court as to whether the insurance company was required to defend the builders insurance policy covered any and all liability imposed by law against the assured for loss of or damage to or destruction of property of others including but not limited to damage resulting from loss of use of property damaged or destroyed and all other indirect and consequential damage for which legal liability exists in connection with such damage to or destruction of property of others sustained during the policy period and arising from any cause whatsoever out of the operations activities work andor business of the assured in the united states of america eichler homes inc v underwriters at lloyds london supra  cal app d   the policy excluded coverage for liability claims against the builder  for repairing or replacing any defective product or products manufactured sold or supplied by the assured or any defective part or parts thereof nor for the cost of such repair or replacement or  for the loss of use of any such defective product or products or part or parts thereof or  for damage to that particular part of any property upon which the assured is or has been working caused by the faulty manner in which the work has been performed id at p  the eichler court after noting an insurance companys duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify  cal appd at p  concluded the insurance company had a duty to defend this case the court explained the plaintiff alleged that because of the negligently installed radiant heating system the market value of his home had been or would be impaired this is an allegation of damage entirely unrelated to damage resulting from the cost of repairs and replacement of the defective heating system and hence is a claim for a loss or damage covered by the insurance that diminution in the market value of the claimants homes because of the presence of the defective radiant heating system would be a proper measure  of damages is supported by geddes  where the court quoted at length and with approval from the case of hauenstein  in hauenstein defective plaster had been applied to a building the court noted that the presence of the defective plaster on the walls of the building constituted property damage and declared the measure of damages is the diminution in the market value of the building or the cost of removing the defective plaster and restoring the building to its former condition plus any loss from deprival of use whichever is the lesser the plaintiffs named in the mann complaint also alleged damage to real property improvements appliances and furnishings these are clearly claims for damages that are separate and distinct from any claim based upon the cost of repair or replacement of the defective heating system itself such claims are clearly within the coverage of appellants policies id at pp  first italics in original remaining italics added a aegea argues the holdings of the geddes and eichler cases support its position that a claim for diminution in the market value of the condominiums is an ensuing loss not excluded by the policy because diminution in market value is a loss separate and distinct from any loss based on the cost of repair or replacement of the excluded losses caused by latent defects faulty workmanship and construction code violations initially we note the geddes and eichler cases are factually distinguishable both in the language of the policies and in the issues presented to the courts in geddes unlike the case here the insurance policy covered liability for damages due to accidents and the issues presented to the court were whether the door failures were accidents and to what extent the damages to other property was covered in eichler unlike the case here the policy covered liability for the loss of or damage to property of others from any cause excluding only claims for repair or replacement of the defective product and the issue before the court was whether the insurance company had a duty to defend a duty broader than the duty to indemnify  not only do the geddes and eichler cases differ from this case due to differences in policy language and issues presented but also they differ because they involved a different type of insurance the geddes and eichler cases involved liability insurance while here we have property damage insurance this is an important distinction it is critical in determining whether an insurance policy covers a loss when the loss has both a covered and an excluded source as the supreme court has explained  property insurance  is an agreement a contract in which the insurer agrees to indemnify the insured in the event that the insured property suffers a covered loss coverage in turn is commonly provided by reference to causation eg loss caused by  certain enumerated perils ¶ the term  perils in traditional property insurance parlance refers to fortuitous active physical forces such as lightning wind and explosion which bring about the loss thus the cause of loss in the context of a property insurance contract is totally different from that in a liability policy this distinction is critical to the resolution of losses involving multiple causes ¶ frequently property losses occur which involve more than one peril that might be considered legally significant if one of the causes perils arguably falls within the coverage grant  commonly either because it is specifically insured as in a named peril policy or not specifically excepted or excluded as in an all risks policy  disputes over coverage can arise the task becomes one of identifying the most important cause of the loss and attributing the loss to that cause citation on the other hand the right to coverage in the third party liability insurance context draws on traditional tort concepts of fault proximate cause and duty this liability analysis differs substantially from the coverage analysis in the property insurance context which draws on the relationship between perils that are either covered or excluded in the contract in liability insurance by insuring for personal liability and agreeing to cover the insured for his own negligence the insurer agrees to cover the insured for a broader spectrum of risks in order to further demonstrate the differences between property loss and liability coverage we compare two sections of a typical homeowners policy  the allrisk property loss coverage section of the policy in this case and the personal liability section at issue in partridge each policy section is governed by separate exclusions for example the allrisk first party property loss coverage section in this case provides for coverage against all risk of physical loss except losses caused by  settling cracking shrinkage bulging or expansion of pavements patios foundations walls floors roofs or ceilings in comparison in partridge the coverage clause of the personal liability section of the homeowners policy provides in relevant part this company agrees to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence  citation moreover the applicable exclusionary clause reads this policy does not apply  under coverage e  personal liability  a to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership maintenance operation use loading or unloading of   any motor vehicle owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured  as the two provisions cited above illustrate under the allrisk first party property policy because generally all risk of physical loss is covered the exclusions become the limitation on loss coverage under the liability portion of the policy on the other hand the focus is at least initially on the insureds legal obligation to pay for injury or damage arising out of an occurrence garvey v state farm fire  casualty co   cal d    cal rptr   pd  fn omitted the geddes and eichler cases relied on by aegea and the trial court both involved liability insurance and therefore the focus of the cases was whether there had been an occurrence for which the insured was liable here the policy is one for property damage not liability the question thus is whether aegeas losses were caused by a covered peril the focus is on causation not tort liability  in deciding that question of causation whether a peril is covered by a property damage policy where there is a concurrence of different causes the efficient cause  the one that sets others in motion  is the cause to which the loss is to be attributed though the other causes may follow it and operate more immediately in producing the disaster citations garvey v state farm fire  casualty co supra  cal d   quoting sabella v wisler   cal d    cal rptr   pd  b using this guideline it becomes apparent there is no dispute that the efficient cause of aegeas losses was one of the excluded perils ie a latent defect faulty workmanship or construction code violation the efficient cause was not diminution in market value diminution in market value is not a peril at all it is a method of measuring damages as was stated in geddes the measure of damages is the diminution in the market value of the building geddes  smith inc v st paul mercury indemnity co supra  cal d   italics added this language from geddes was quoted by the eichler court to support its conclusion the diminution in the market value of the home was a separate and distinct loss eichler homes inc v underwriters at lloyds london supra  cal app d   the eichler court stated that diminution in the market value of the claimants homes because of the presence of the defective radiant heating system would be a proper measure of damages is supported by geddes  id at p  italics added the eichler courts language that an allegation of diminution of market value was entirely unrelated to damage resulting from the cost of repairs and replacement of the defective heating system and was separate and distinct was not a holding diminution in market value is itself a peril these cases were not addressing perils they were addressing liability for damage to the defective product itself eg cost of replacing or  repairing the defective product as opposed to liability for other damage caused by the defective product these cases held damage to other property could be measured by the repair or replacement cost or by the diminution in value to the entire property caused by the presence of the defective product aegeas attempt to substitute peril for liability in the above formula does not work aegeas formula would say there is a peril called diminution of market value which is distinct from a peril called repair or replacement costs  as the supreme court has explained and as is clear from the policy here perils or risks refer to fortuitous active physical forces such as lightning wind and explosion which bring about the loss garvey v state farm fire  casualty co supra  cal d   neither diminution in value nor the cost of repair or replacement are active physical forces  they are not the cause of the damage to the structures they are the measure of the loss or damage c the policy here states it insures against direct physical loss except when due to certain enumerated causes diminution of market value is not specifically excluded because it is not a cause of loss it is the measure of a loss caused by something else the trial courts ruling that there were factual issues as to the magnitude of the diminution in value and as to which elements causing the diminution in value were excluded losses and which were covered consequential results of excluded losses was correct to the extent it recognized there were factual disputes about the amount of aegeas losses but the question before the trial court was not whether aegea had suffered losses clearly it had nor the extent of their losses unresolved but rather whether the insurance policy covered those losses there was no factual dispute on this issue the insurance policy unambiguously excluded coverage disposition let mandate issue directing the superior court to enter summary judgment favoring state farm against aegea huffman j and todd j concurred notes  among the problem doors were  replacement bathroom doors which arrived equipped with chimes and letter

had produced and supplied the control valves by opinion dated april   the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants middleby pitco and american kitchen collectively “the moving defendants” on the basis that state farm lacked evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the “acts omissions or products for which the moving defendants would be responsible caused the fires” as the court explained state farm’s experts did not theorize as to the specific cause of either fire with regard to the august fire state farm offered a “oneandahalfpage report which briefly    concluded that ‘based on the location of the most severe fire damage and the lowest burn the fire originated at the thermostat housing within the interior controls of the fryer’ and was accidental” state farm’s fire investigator found that the november fire “resulted from an electrical or mechanical malfunction within the pitco fryer” and stated that “further analysis of the subject fryer should be conducted by an electrical andor mechanical engineer to determine the specific cause of the fryer’s failure” it is unclear that state farm obtained the recommended additional analysis and no additional reports or opinions were disclosed to the court or the defendants in its decision the court rejected state farm’s argument that res ipsa loquitur applied the court found that the facts of these cases did not “warrant an inference of negligence of such force as to call for an explanation or rebuttal” from the moving defendants a plaintiff’s proffer of evidence as to where a fire originated within a piece

is not in active use    state farm thus provides no information from which this court or a lay jury could draw reasonable nonspeculative inferences about the probable cause or causes of fires originating in the locations identified by its experts summary judgment was appropriate the court concluded because state farm failed to provide “the additional expert opinions required to expand its expert fire investigators’ opinions about the origins of the fires into theories regarding the fires’ causes” the court further held that state farm had not addressed “the possibility that the fryers may have been modified postsale or subject to improper or inadequate use cleaning or maintenance in such a way as to have caused the fires” and had not made a showing that the fryers were under the defendants’ management or control at the time any negligence likely occurred ii state farm now petitions for reconsideration of the court’s april  summary judgment opinion arguing that the court disregarded factual disputes and failed to consider the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff state farm submits that the court’s opinion is at odds with its discussion of res ipsa loquitur principles in moore v anesthesia services pa in which the court permitted a plaintiff to proceed to trial with product liability claims based upon a theory of “conditional” res ipsa loquitur
