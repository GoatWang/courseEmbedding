delaware law updates pdf brookstone partners acquisition xvi llc v tanus ca no 7vcn del ch aug   noble vc august  in this letter opinion the delaware court of chancery denied plaintiff brookstone partners acquisition xvi llc’s “brookstone” motion to expedite finding that brookstone unreasonably delayed in seeking expedition of its claims brought against abraham tanus  brookstone is a member of woodcrafters home products holdings llc the “company” a delaware limited liability company governed by a board of managers  tanus is alleged to have been a manager of the company at all relevant times  tanus is also the chief executive officer of woodcrafters home products llc “whp” which is fullyowned by the company                on may   tanus initiated suit against brookstone and other parties in the district court of the 9th judicial district of hidalgo county texas the “texas action” tanus seeks a declaratory judgment in the texas action that he did not breach his employment agreement or woodcrafters’ amended and restated limited liability company agreement the “llc agreement” in connection with the acquisition of design imaging llc “design imaging” by an affiliate of tanus trustone products llc “trustone”  design imaging is one of the company’s most important suppliers and their business relationship is governed by a licensing agreement the “licensing agreement” set to expire by its own terms on october                    on may   brookstone brought suit in the delaware court of chancery alleging that tanus’ involvement in the design imaging transaction was a breach of his employment agreement the llc agreement and his fiduciary duties the “delaware action”  the delaware action is founded on brookstone’s allegation that tanus is causing design imaging to refuse to extend the licensing agreement in order to devalue the company  brookstone has an option to sell the company to a third party after february  but such option is subject to a right of first refusal held by companies allegedly controlled by tanus  accordingly brookstone contends that tanus’ efforts to devalue the company will similarly devalue brookstone’s option to sell the company while permitting entities controlled by tanus to exercise their right of first refusal at an artificially deflated price  brookstone did not seek expedition at the time of filing its complaint in the delaware action                on july   brookstone and tanus along with the other parties to the texas action participated in a teleconference with the texas court for the purpose of scheduling a trial date  the texas court originally offered a trial date in february   however after one of brookstone’s attorneys requested that the trial be pushed back to june  the parties ultimately agreed on an april  trial date  on august   brookstone moved to expedite the delaware action                notably in considering brookstone’s motion to expedite the chancery court found that brookstone was substantially aware that it was dealing with a finite amount of time at the initiation of the delaware action given that the licensing agreement is set to expire on its own terms on october    for this reason the chancery court found brookstone’s delay prejudicial in denying brookstone’s motion to expedite the chancery court acknowledged the result may have been different if brookstone had moved for expedition at the initiation of the delaware action of shortly thereafter  indeed the chancery court reiterated that parties seeking expedition should do so with all alacrity the full

years with anomatic it’s a small group each individual inside the firm brings a different perspective and a different talent that sheds a different light on any given topic   the level of intellect and horsepower brought to the table is significant  for the typical entrepreneurial guy like myself that pretty much had to make every decision by himself it’s certainly a hell of a resource to have   there’s healthy debate  not everyone agrees all the time but they challenge me to rethink and question my own ideas and beliefs in some areas i think it always results in a better outcome a more thoughtful outcome   i would say it really boils down to guys that are very open minded bring a lot of diverse experience and diverse backgrounds to the table    i think the group as a whole is an extremely honest group of people  very ethical   scott rusch ceo anomatic  to present   years with anomatic it’s been a wonderful great ride for the last ten or eleven years it wasn’t easy   the expertise that the brookstone guys had and that fortitude that backing that is what you really need when you make tough decisions i didn’t worry about the immediate results because we made the right long term decisions together we make the right long term decisions for the business  you do what you have to do and brookstone’s long term backing fortifies you in business  when you have a financial partner that says to you we will take the risk  we will do the right thing it means everything    in the last two years a partner at the firm and i have connected in a very unique way where we are almost finishing each other’s sentences and really can understand exactly what had to be done when it had to be done and how to do it i want to thank him for that   i really cherish the relationships that have made this happen over the past ten or eleven years   gordon strout founder  ceo instone 99 to present it’s a small group each individual inside the firm brings a different perspective and a different talent that sheds a different light on any given topic   the level of intellect and horsepower brought to the table is significant  for the typical entrepreneurial guy like myself that pretty much had to make every decision by himself it’s certainly a hell of a resource to have   there’s healthy debate  not everyone agrees all the time but they challenge me to rethink and question my own ideas and beliefs in some areas i think it always results in a better outcome a more thoughtful outcome   i would say it really boils down to guys that are very open minded bring a lot of diverse experience and diverse backgrounds to the table    i think the group as a whole is an extremely honest group of people  very ethical   paul kreie senior managing director present the brookstone guys are great to work with they are very thorough thoughtful and diligent in their approach they approach business from a very practical and pragmatic perspective   i think they are very effective communicators with us as coinvestors and lending sources compared to other private equity firms i think brookstone is much more upfront open and proactive in their communications good bad indifferent we hear about things real time they really view us as true partners in the relationship and not like lenders who are only there when you need them   i think their approach to the business and how they deal with us is much more relationship oriented than other folks although they are from the east coast we view them as having more of a midwestern kind of values set  they are ethical based moral based and have a moral compass in how they treat people and deal with people in businesses i think from that perspective they are head and shoulders above a lot of the other firms that we’ve had relationships with   tom gutman senior vice president present focused on aligning everyone’s interests – management capital partners good and honorable people they work hard to understand your business brookstone cares about aligning their interest with management they care very much about the capital partners in their deals the firm plays a key role not only as an investor and as an equity provider but also operationally
