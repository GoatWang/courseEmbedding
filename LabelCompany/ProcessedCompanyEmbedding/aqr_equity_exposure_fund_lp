allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches aqr risk parity fund foreign investing involves special risks

price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security the fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential fund gains and increase potential fund losses when investing in bonds yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market

parity fund invests globally across stocks bonds currencies and commodities allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional

register login library glossary glossary a collection of definitions related to investing absolute return a category of investment strategies that seek to generate returns that are uncorrelated to stock and bond markets it is sometimes used as a synonym for hedge funds but while some hedge fund strategies qualify—such as equity market neutral and global macro—many hedge funds have tended to incorporate passive market exposure into their portfolios tags total return traditional investment active management any investment approach other than one aiming to match the performance of a passive benchmark index or a buyandhold portfolio examples of active management strategies include longonly strategies aiming to beat a benchmark longshort absolute return strategies and indeed any strategy that deviates from marketcap weighted indices the precise boundary between passive and active management may be debatable for multiasset class portfolios where the true market may not be known or investable tags passive management alpha beta benchmark index alpha from a statistics perspective an unexplained average return from an industry perspective returns generated by skilled active managers for a benchmarkoriented strategy alpha is measured by portfolio returns in excess of benchmark returns more broadly returns that cannot be explained by exposure to common risk factors and may stem from a variety of sources including security selection market timing portfolio management execution or risk control tags active management passive management beta benchmark alternative beta exposures to alternative risk factors alternative risk factors are wellknown empiricallytested sources of return that can be systematically harvested through dynamic longshort strategies they can be thought of either as returns that underlie “classic” hedge fund strategies hedge fund risk premia or the returns from “classic” styles style premia such as value momentum carry and defensive exposure to these risk factors results in alternative risk premia or rewards for assuming active systematic risk risk that in the context of modern portfolio theory cannot be diversified away tags alternative risk premia beta risk premia market risk premia alternative investment alternatives are typically thought of as investments other than longonly stocks and bonds generally they can be divided into two categories alternative asset classes such as private equity and commodities and alternative strategies such as classic styles or hedge fund investments alternative asset classes are usually longonly and benchmarkoriented while alternative strategies are commonly longshort and compared to their peers or a cash benchmark tags alternative beta alternative risk premia risk premia asset class longonly longshort benchmark index alternative risk premia the rewards for bearing alternative risk exposure or the rewards for assuming active systematic risks risks that in the context of modern portfolio theory cannot be diversified away alternative risk exposures are wellknown empiricallytested sources of return that can be systematically harvested through dynamic longshort strategies they can be thought of either as returns that underlie “classic” hedge fund strategies hedge fund risk premia or the returns from “classic” styles style premia such as value momentum carry and defensive tags alternative beta beta risk premia market risk premia asset class a group of securities that share financial characteristics and tend to behave similarly traditional asset classes include stocks and bonds and alternative asset classes include private equity and commodities tags risk premia market risk premia alternative investment longonly longshort benchmark index beta alternative beta benchmark a predefined portfolio index or strategy against which the performance of an active strategy is compared or which a passive strategy seeks to match for an active longonly strategy the benchmark is often a market index with similar risk characteristics to the active strategy for an absolute return strategy the benchmark is usually the riskfree rate tags active management passive management alpha beta index longonly beta statistics a measure of one dependent variable’s sensitivity to another independent variable often the equity market beta the regression slope coefficient is the product of the relative volatility of the dependent and independent variables and the correlation between the two  more practical a security or strategy’s sensitivity to a particular risk factor for example an equity index fund’s beta to the equity market will likely be  a twicelevered equity index fund’s beta to the equity market will likely be about  tags active management benchmark alternative beta market risk premia alternative risk premia risk premia index capital allocation making portfolio allocation decisions based on nominal or dollar values investors who make decisions based on dollars may build portfolios with concentrated risk exposures for example the traditional  stockbond portfolio is roughly  dominated by equity risk as such investors should look beyond capitalbased asset allocation to better understand a portfolio’s true risk exposures tags risk allocation capital asset pricing model a model that describes the pricing of risky assets it relates a stocks expected return only to its beta or sensitivity to the overall stock market tags efficient market hypothesis beta risk premia carry a style premia strategy that seeks to capture the tendency of higheryielding assets to provide higher returns than loweryielding assets generally carry can be thought of as the expected return on an asset assuming its price doesn’t change and is derived from yield or income tags style premia factor investing alternative beta alternative risk premia convertible arbitrage a “classic” hedge fund strategy that generally buys a convertible bond and shortsells the relevant stock it aims to capture the discount illiquidity premium of convertible bonds relative to the fair value of their constituent parts bond  equity call option it may also hedge out other risks such as changing interest rates or the bond’s creditworthiness tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia correlation statistics a measure of how variables — such as securities prices interest rates or volatilities — move in relation with another taking a value between  and  positive correlation implies that as one price moves either up or down the other price tends to move in the same direction negative correlation means that when one price moves the other price tends to move in the opposite direction if the correlation is zero the movements in the two prices or other variables have no detectable relationship more practical correlation is an important consideration for portfolio construction and diversification a combination of unrelated or uncorrelated assets can results in higher riskadjusted returns conversely incorporating an asset that is highly correlated to the existing portfolio does little to improve a portfolio’s efficiency tags diversification modern portfolio theory dedicated short bias a “classic” hedge fund strategy that generally maintains net short equity exposure it profits from the inability for many investors to go short companies that are overpriced relative to their fundamentals tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative risk premia alternative beta defensive a style premia strategy that aims to invest in assets with lower risk and higher quality in order to generate higher riskadjusted returns tags style premia factor investing alternative beta alternative risk premia discretionary investing an investment philosophy in which the manager makes a subjective judgment call on market conditions and then trades based on these opinions this is in contrast to a quantitative approach tags quantitative investing diversification diversification can be achieved along many dimensions such as by geography asset class risk factor strategy style or indicator the goal of diversification is to eliminate systematic or market risks which are typically not rewarded when the focus is on the diversification of specific risks diversification means reducing exposure to specific risks that are undesirable because they are unrewarded when the focus is on the diversification of systematic risks it means efficient allocation to factors that bring positive longterm rewards diversification has famously been called the only free lunch that markets have to offer in that a combination of uncorrelated strategies can result in higher riskadjusted returns tags modern portfolio theory correlation efficient frontier a concept in modern portfolio theory that describes the highest expected returns available for a given volatility under a noleverage constraint tags modern portfolio theory correlation volatility minimum variance efficient market hypothesis the hypothesis that security prices fully reflect all available information in practice the emh cannot be tested directly independent of a pricing model to determine if security prices fully reflect all available information a model that explains how prices are supposed to reflect this information must also be proposed tags capital asset pricing model equity market neutral a “classic” hedge fund strategy that generally maintains neutral equity market exposure it aims to capture systematic mispricing in global equity markets typically between different stocks in the same sector tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia eventdriven arbitrage a classic hedge fund arbitrage strategy that seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies that may occur before or after corporate events such as bankruptcies mergers acquisitions or spinoffs tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia excess return strictly speaking and especially for absolute return strategies this is the return in excess of a predefined “riskfree” rate typically the return on treasury bills or other sovereign cash instruments for longonly strategies it may refer to the return in excess of a benchmark this is also called the active return factor investing an investment strategy based on the assumption that there are sources of risk that compensate investors with returns traditionally the primary factor is the market as in the wellknown threefactor model of fama and french while other factors may be value or momentum portfolios can be formed based on single factors ie equity value or multiple factors ie equity value and equity momentum where factors have low correlations to each other combining multiple factors can be a powerful investment tool offering improved riskadjusted returns tags risk premia style premia value momentum defensive carry correlation fixed income arbitrage a “classic” hedge fund strategy that aims to capture a range of mispricings in global bond and currency markets including those created by market participants who are not profitmaximizing tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia global macro a “classic” hedge fund strategy that trades based on movements in economic variables it aims to capture mispricings across major global asset classes including stock bond currency and commodity markets tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia hedge fund a commingled investment vehicle that typically uses active strategies employing leverage shortselling andor derivatives in an attempt to provide positive returns regardless of moves in broad stock or bond markets hedge funds are usually subject to lighter regulation than other investment funds and marketed to more sophisticated investors index a weighted “basket” of securities — stocks bonds commodities or other tradable assets — used to track the performance of a particular market construction varies from index to index with “capitalizationweighted indices” being among the most popular eg sp  others include priceweighted indices eg dow jones industrial average indices weighted according to fundamental measures eg fundamental indices and ones that are weighted according to risk measures eg msci minimum volatility index tags active management passive management alpha beta benchmark longonly information ratio a measure of a portfolios riskadjusted returns relative to a benchmark it is typically used for a longonly strategy and measures alpha active return over a benchmark per unit of tracking error how much active risk the strategy takes relative to its benchmark tags sharpe ratio benchmark longshort equity a “classic” hedge fund strategy that maintains long and short positions in equity markets it pursues a range of opportunities in global stock markets including relative value between sectors and growthbased stockpicking tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia longonly any investment strategy that does not involve shortselling of securities or of derivatives the returns of longonly strategies are usually highly correlated to the broader markets from which they select their investments their performance is often but not always measured relative to a market benchmark tags longshort market neutral longshort any investment strategy that takes both long and short positions in securities or derivatives usually in an attempt to reduce exposure to broad market moves longshort strategies may have a directional bias and are not necessarily managed to be marketneutral tags longonly market neutral managed futures a “classic” hedge fund strategy that invests long or short in futures contracts on a variety of commodities as well as financial futures on equity indices treasuries and currencies it profits from the tendency of assets to exhibit shortand longterm trends tags hedge fund alternative investment alternative beta alternative risk premia market neutral a type of longshort strategy that sizes its long and short positions in an effort to minimize or eliminate exposure to broad market moves market neutral strategies can be particularly valuable diversifiers alongside portfolios dominated by market directional risks tags longonly longshort market risk premia the rewards for bearing asset class risk exposure an example includes the equity risk premium for investing in stock markets tags risk premia alternative risk premia beta alternative beta minimum variance used to describe the portfolio with the lowest variance or volatility squared given a universe of securities for example the minimum variance portfolio for stocks in the sp  would be the portfolio of stocks in the sp that results in the lowest overall portfolio variance from the standpoint of the efficient frontier the minimum variance portfolio is represented by the leftmost point on the curve tags efficient frontier volatility modern portfolio theory modern portfolio theory a theory of how to build a portfolio that maximizes expected return given a level of volatility or that minimizes volatility for a given level of expected return this can be done by varying the weights given to various assets taking into account estimates of their expected returns and volatilities and the correlations between them tags diversification correlation volatility efficient frontier momentum a style premia strategy that aims to take advantage of the tendency for an assets recent relative performance to continue in the near future tags style premia factor investing alternative beta alternative risk premia mutual fund a commingled openended investment vehicle that is typically regulated and accessible to the general public either directly or through registered investment advisors mutual funds may invest in stocks bonds or other securities cash or alternative investments net asset value the total value of an investment vehicle’s assets less the value of its liabilities changes in nav may be caused by investment returns or by investor flows the nav per share reflects the value of each unit of investment the net return on an investment at redemption is approximately the change in nav per share less fees passive management an investment approach aiming to match the performance of a passive benchmark index or portfolio without making use of return forecasts this is in contrast to active management strictly speaking only a capitalizationweighted buyandhold portfolio is passive since all other portfolios—including “smart beta” indices—involve tilts away from the market portfolio and require active rebalancing tags active management benchmark index alpha beta quantitative investing an investment philosophy in which systematic model or rulebased criteria are used to make investment decisions this is in contrast to a discretionary approach tags discretionary investing risk allocation making portfolio allocation decisions based on risk units rather than nominal or capital dollars investors tend to achieve a better balanced portfolio if they make allocations in volatility or risk units not dollars tags capital allocation risk premia the rewards for taking risk in given strategies or asset classes examples include longonly market risk premia and longshort alternative risk premia tags alternative beta beta market risk premia alternative risk premia sharpe ratio  mathematically the annualized return in excess of cash total return − riskfree return divided by the annualized standard deviation or volatility of returns  more practical a measure of a portfolio’s riskadjusted performance in general the higher the sharpe ratio the more an investor should be compensated for bearing risk though the sharpe ratio does not reflect all kinds of risks for example it does not describe how or when losses occurred nor does it provide information on the liquidity of the underlying investment tags information ratio style premia a source of alternative return backed by economic theory and decades of data across geographies and asset groups style exposure can be achieved in a longonly portfolio by overweighting securities with positive style attributes eg value stocks however a marketneutral longshort portfolio seeks to provide more active and efficient style exposure while maintaining low correlation to traditional markets tags value momentum defensive carry value alternative beta alternative risk premia traditional investment a category of investment strategies that are generally considered to include longonly stock and bond strategies with longonly benchmarks such as the msci world or barclays aggregate tags absolute return total return trendfollowing a style premia strategy that is related to momentum and involves buying assets that have recently performed well and shorting assets that have recently lost money it differs from momentum investing in that momentum buys assets that have done well relative to their peers while trendfollowing considers each asset independently as a result trendfollowing strategies can at times take highly market directional positions tags style premia factor investing alternative beta alternative risk premia value a style premia strategy that aims to take advantage of the tendency for relatively cheap assets to outperform relatively expensive ones tags style premia factor investing alternative beta alternative risk premia volatility statistically a measure of the variation in returns for a given investment volatility is the same as standard deviation and is typically shown as an annualized number over time more practical volatility can be used to gauge the likelihood of realizing or failing to realize a given return target it allows us to better assess how realized returns can vary around expected returns other applications can be used to effectively manage risk through volatility targeting tags volatility targeting volatility targeting a method to effectively manage risk because volatility can be reasonably well predicted over short horizons it can be a useful risk management input a volatilitytargeted portfolio invests fewer dollars when markets are more volatile and more dollars when markets are less volatile the goal is to achieve more consistent portfolio risk regardless of market volatility which may provide investors a ‘smoother ride’ a volatilitytargeted portfolio must be actively managed because the volatility forecast changes over time tags volatility beta  statistics a measure of one variable’s sensitivity to another variable usually equity risk  it is similar to correlation but is not constrained to the range of – to  an asset’s equity market beta the regression slope is the product of the relative volatility of the asset versus equity market and the correlation between the two tags absolute return total return total return the total return of an investment including the price change and yield incomecarry a category of

has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics
