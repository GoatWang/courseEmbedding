meeting��notification will contain proxy materials and a form with which to give nationwide voting instructions��nationwide will vote shares for which no instructions are received in the same proportion as those that are received what this means to you is that when only a small number of contract owners vote each vote has a greater impact on and may control the outcome of the vote �  � the number of shares which a contract owner may vote is determined by dividing the cash value of the amount they have allocated to an underlying mutual fund by the net asset value of the underlying mutual fund��nationwide will designate a date for this determination not more than  days before the shareholder meeting � material conflicts � the underlying mutual funds may be offered through separate accounts of other insurance companies as well as through other separate accounts of nationwide��nationwide does not anticipate any disadvantages to this��however it is possible that a conflict may arise between the interests of the variable account and one or more of the other separate accounts in which these underlying mutual funds participate � material conflicts may occur due to a change in

nationwides products��for more information on the exact compensation arrangement associated with this contract please consult your registered representative � underlying mutual fund payments � nationwide�s relationship with the underlying mutual funds � the underlying mutual funds incur expenses each time they sell administer or redeem their shares��the variable account aggregates contract owner purchase redemption and transfer requests and submits net or aggregated purchaseredemption requests to each underlying mutual fund daily��the variable account not the contract owners is the underlying mutual fund shareholder��when the variable account aggregates transactions the underlying mutual fund does not incur the expense of processing individual transactions it would normally incur if it sold its shares directly to the public��nationwide incurs these expenses instead �  � nationwide also incurs the distribution costs of selling the contract as discussed above which benefit the underlying mutual funds by providing contract owners with subaccount options that correspond to the underlying mutual funds � an investment adviser or subadviser of an underlying mutual fund or its affiliates may provide nationwide or its affiliates with wholesaling services that assist in the distribution of the contract and may pay nationwide or its affiliates to participate in educational andor marketing activities��these activities may provide the adviser or subadviser or their affiliates with increased exposure to persons involved in the distribution of the contract � types of payments nationwide receives � in light of the above the underlying mutual funds and their affiliates make certain payments to nationwide or its affiliates the �payments���the amount of these payments

advisory fee which is deducted from underlying mutual fund assets and is reflected in mutual fund charges � furthermore nationwide benefits from assets invested in nationwide�s affiliated underlying mutual funds ie nationwide variable insurance trust because its affiliates also receive compensation from the underlying mutual funds for investment advisory administrative transfer agency distribution andor other services��thus nationwide may receive more revenue with respect to affiliated underlying mutual funds than unaffiliated underlying mutual funds��nationwide took into consideration the anticipated payments from the underlying mutual funds when it determined the charges imposed under the contracts apart from fees and expenses imposed by the underlying mutual funds��without these payments nationwide would have imposed higher charges under the contract amount of payments nationwide receives � most underlying mutual funds or their affiliates have agreed to make payments to nationwide or its affiliates although the applicable percentages may vary from underlying mutual fund to underlying mutual fund and some may not make any payments at all��because the amount of the actual payments nationwide and its affiliates receive depends on the assets of the underlying mutual funds attributable to the contract nationwide and its affiliates may receive higher payments from underlying mutual funds with lower percentages but greater assets than from underlying mutual funds that have higher percentages but fewer assets � for additional information related to

anticipate earning a profit in later contract years��in general nationwides profit will be greater the higher the investment return and the longer the contract is held � standard charges and deductions � mortality and expense risk charge � nationwide deducts a mortality and expense risk charge from the variable account��this amount is computed on a daily basis and is equal to an annualized rate of  of the daily net assets of the variable account � the mortality and expense risk charge compensates nationwide for providing the insurance benefits under the contract including the contract�s standard death benefit that � �  � � provides a guaranteed death benefit to the��beneficiaryies even if the market declines��it also compensates nationwide for assuming the risk that annuitants will live longer than assumed��finally the mortality and expense risk charge compensates nationwide for guaranteeing that charges will not increase regardless of actual expenses��nationwide may realize a profit from this charge which nationwide may use to finance the distribution of the contracts � administrative charge � nationwide deducts an administrative charge from the variable account��this amount is computed on a daily basis and is equal to an annualized rate of  of the daily net assets of the variable account � the administrative charge reimburses nationwide for

daily net assets of the variable account applicants for contracts with annuitants who are age  or younger at the time of application may elect the return of premium enhanced death benefit option��generally if the annuitant dies before the annuitization date the death benefit will be the greater of � �� the contract value or � �� the total of all purchase payments made to the contract less an adjustment for amounts surrendered � the adjustment for amounts surrendered will reduce item  above in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced on the dates of the partial surrenders � for contracts that have elected this option if the total of all purchase payments made to the contract is greater than  the death benefit will be adjusted as described in the �death benefit calculations� provision on page  � extra value options � for an additional charge an applicant can elect one of two extra value options � applicants should be aware of the following prior to electing an extra value option � �� nationwide believes that the extra value options even after the direct and indirect costs associated with the options will benefit the majority of contract owners��if you have questions about whether an extra value option is appropriate for you please consult your individual registered representative specifically about the option � �� nationwide may make a profit from the extra value option charge � �� because the extra value option charge will be assessed against the entire contract value for the first  contract years contract owners who anticipate making additional purchase payments after the first contract year which will not receive the bonus credit but will be assessed the extra value option charge should carefully examine the extra value option and consult their financial adviser regarding its desirability � �� nationwide may take back or �recapture� all or part of the amount credited under an extra value option in the event of early surrenders including revocation of the contract during the contractual freelook period � �� if the market declines during the period that the bonus credits are subject to recapture the amount subject to recapture could decrease the amount of contract value available for surrender � �� the cost of the extra value options and the recapture of the credits in the event of a surrender could exceed any benefit of receiving an extra value option credits �  extra value option � for an additional charge at an annualized rate of  of the daily net assets of the variable account an applicant can elect the  extra value option��after the end of the th contract year nationwide will discontinue assessing the charge associated with the  extra value option �  � in exchange for the first  months the contract is in force nationwide will apply a credit to the contract equal to  of each purchase payment made to the contract��this credit which is funded from nationwide�s general account will be allocated among the subaccounts in the same proportion that the purchase payment is allocated to the contract��for purposes of all benefits and taxes under these contracts credits applied under this option are considered earnings not purchase payments �  extra value option � for an additional charge at an annualized rate of  of the daily net assets of the variable account an applicant can elect the  extra value option after the end of the th contract year nationwide will discontinue assessing the charge associated with the  extra value option � in exchange for the first  months the contract is in force nationwide will apply a credit to the contract equal to  of each purchase payment made to the contract��this credit which is funded from nationwide�s general account will be allocated among the

earnings not purchase payments � recapture of extra value option credits � nationwide will recapture amounts credited to the contract in connection with the extra value options if � a�� the contract owner cancels the contract pursuant to the contractual freelook provision � b�� the contract owner takes a full surrender before the end of the th contract year or � c�� in any contract year before the end of the th contract year the contract owner takes one or more partial surrenders that total more than  of the total of all purchase payments made to the contract during the first contract year � contract owners should carefully consider the consequences of taking a surrender that subjects part or all of the credit to recapture��if contract value decreases due to poor market performance the recapture provisions could decrease the amount of contract value available for surrender � nationwide will not recapture credits under the extra value options under the following circumstances � �� if the distribution is taken as a result of a death annuitization or to meet minimum distribution requirements under the internal revenue code � �� if the distribution is taken in order to pay financial advisor fees or � �� if the surrender occurs after the end of the th contract year � recapture resulting from exercising freelook privilege � if the contract owner cancels the contract pursuant to the contractual freelook provision nationwide will recapture the entire amount credited to the contract under this option��in those states that require the return of purchase payments for iras that are surrendered pursuant to the contractual freelook nationwide will recapture the entire amount credited to the contract under this option but under no circumstances will the amount returned be less than the purchase payments made to the contract��in those states that allow a return of contract value the contract owner will retain any earnings attributable to the amount credited but all losses attributable to the amount credited will be incurred by nationwide � recapture resulting from a full surrender � for contracts with the  extra value option or the  extra value option if the contract owner takes a full surrender�of the contract before the end of the th contract year nationwide will recapture the entire amount credited to the contract under the option � recapture resulting from a partial surrender � for contracts with the  extra value option or the  extra value option if a contract owner during the first  contract years takes one or more partial surrenders each contract year that total more than  of the total of all purchase payments made to the contract during the first contract year nationwide will recapture a proportional part of the amount credited to the contract under this option � for example mr x who elected the  extra value option makes a  initial deposit to his contract and receives a  credit of ��in contract year  mr x takes a  surrender��under the contract mr x is entitled to surrender up to  of purchase payments made to the contract during the first contract year without subjecting any of the bonus to recapture��thus he can take  x    free of recapture��that leaves  of the surrender subject to recapture��for the recapture calculation nationwide will multiply that  by  to get the portion of the original credit that nationwide will recapture��thus the amount of the original credit recaptured as a result of the  partial surrender is  � the amount recaptured will be taken from the subaccounts in the same proportion that purchase payments are allocated as of the surrender date � some state jurisdictions require a reduced recapture schedule��please refer to your contract for state specific information � dynamic advantage program � the dynamic advantage program �dap� may be elected at any time before annuitization��while the dap is in effect nationwide will deduct a charge equal to an annualized rate of not more than  of the daily net assets of the variable account��in exchange nationwide will provide administrative services enabling contract owners to have their contract value allocated and reallocated according to actively managed models for which rydex advisory services llc acts as investment adviser �  � � removal of variable account charges � for certain optional benefits a charge is assessed only for a specified period of time��to remove a variable account charge at the end of the specified charge period nationwide systematically rerates the contract��this rerating results in lower contract charges but no change in contract value or any other contractual benefit � rerating involves two steps the adjustment of contract expenses and the adjustment of the number of units in the contract � the first step the adjustment of contract expenses involves removing the charge from the unit value calculation��for example on a contract where the only optional benefit elected is the  extra value option the variable account value will be calculated using unit values with variable account charges of  for the first  contract years��at the end of that period the contract will be rerated and the  charge associated with the  extra value option will be removed��from that point on the variable account value will be calculated using the unit values with variable account charges at ��thus the  extra value option charge is no longer included in the daily subaccount valuation for the contract � the second step of the rerating process the adjustment of the number of units in the contract is necessary in order to keep the rerating process from altering the contract value��generally for any given subaccount the higher the variable account charges the lower the unit value and vice versa��for example subaccount x with charges of  will have a lower unit value than subaccount x with charges of  higher expenses result in lower unit values��when upon rerating the unit values used in calculating variable account value are dropped from the higher expense level to the lower expense level the higher unit values will cause an incidental increase in the contract value��in order to avoid this incidental increase nationwide adjusts the number of units in the contract down so that the contract value after the rerating is the same as the contract value before the rerating � ownership and interests in the contract � contract owner � prior to the annuitization date the contract owner has all rights under the contract unless a joint owner is named��if a joint owner is named each joint owner has all rights under the contract��purchasers who name someone other than themselves as the contract owner will have no rights under the contract � on the annuitization date the annuitant becomes the contract owner unless the contract owner is a charitable remainder trust��if the contract owner is a charitable remainder trust the charitable remainder trust continues to be the contract owner after annuitization � contract owners of nonqualified contracts may name a new contract owner at any time before the annuitization date��any change of contract owner automatically revokes any prior contract owner designation��changes in contract ownership may result in federal income taxation and may be subject to state and federal gift taxes � joint owner � joint owners each own an undivided interest in the contract � nonqualified contract owners can name a joint owner at any time before annuitization��however joint owners must be spouses at the time joint ownership is requested unless state law requires nationwide to allow nonspousal joint owners � generally the exercise of any ownership rights under the contract must be in writing and signed by both joint owners��however if a written election signed by both contract owners authorizing nationwide to allow the exercise of ownership rights independently by either joint owner is submitted nationwide will permit joint owners to act independently��if such an authorization is submitted nationwide will not be liable for any loss liability cost or expense for acting in accordance with the instructions of either joint owner � if either joint owner dies before the annuitization date the contract continues with the surviving joint owner as the remaining contract owner � contingent owner � the contingent owner succeeds to the rights of a contract owner if a contract owner who is not the annuitant dies before the annuitization date and there is no surviving joint owner � if a contract owner who is the annuitant dies before the annuitization date the contingent owner will not have any rights under the contract unless such contingent owner is also the beneficiary � the contract owner may name a contingent owner at any time before the annuitization date��contingent owners may only be named for nonqualified contracts � annuitant � the annuitant is the person who will receive annuity payments and upon whose

coannuitant � a coannuitant if named must be the annuitant�s spouse��the coannuitant may be named at any time prior to annuitization and will receive the benefit of the spousal protection feature subject to the conditions set forth in the �spousal protection feature� provision � if either coannuitant dies before the annuitization date the surviving coannuitant may continue the contract and will receive the benefit of the spousal protection feature � beneficiary and contingent beneficiary � the beneficiary is the person who is entitled to the death benefit if the annuitant dies before the annuitization date and there is no joint owner��the contract owner can name more than one beneficiary��multiple beneficiaries will share the death benefit equally unless otherwise specified � a contingent beneficiary will succeed to the rights of the beneficiary if no beneficiary is alive when a death benefit is paid��the contract owner can name more than one contingent beneficiary��multiple contingent beneficiaries will share the death benefit equally unless otherwise specified � changes to the parties to the contract � prior to the annuitization date and subject to any existing

purchase payments � nationwide allocates purchase payments to subaccounts as instructed by the contract owner��shares of the underlying mutual funds allocated to the subaccounts are purchased at net asset value then converted into accumulation units � contract owners can change allocations or make exchanges among the subaccounts��however no change may be made that would result in an amount less than  of the purchase payments being allocated to any subaccount��in the event that nationwide receives such a request nationwide will inform the contract owner that the allocation instructions are invalid and that the contract�s allocations among the subaccounts prior to the request will remain in effect��certain transactions may be subject to conditions imposed by the underlying mutual funds as well as those set forth in the contract � determining the contract value � the contract value is the value of amounts allocated to the subaccounts � if part or all of the contract value is surrendered or charges are assessed against the whole contract value nationwide will deduct a proportionate amount from each of the subaccounts determining variable account value � valuing an accumulation unit � purchase payments or transfers allocated to subaccounts are accounted for in accumulation units��accumulation unit values for each subaccount are determined by calculating the net investment factor for the underlying mutual funds for the current valuation period and multiplying that result with the accumulation unit values determined on the previous valuation period � nationwide uses the net investment factor as a way to calculate the investment performance of a subaccount from valuation period to valuation period��for each subaccount the net investment factor shows the investment performance of the underlying mutual fund in which a particular subaccount invests including the charges assessed against that subaccount for a valuation period � the net investment factor is determined by dividing a by b and then subtracting c from the result where � a�� is the sum of � �� the net asset value of the underlying mutual fund as of the end of the current valuation period and � �� the per share amount of any dividend or income distributions made by the underlying mutual fund if the date of the dividend or income distribution occurs during the current valuation period � b�� is the net asset value of the underlying mutual fund determined as of the end of the preceding valuation period and � c�� is a factor representing the daily variable account charges which may include charges for contract options chosen by the contract owner��the factor is equal to an annualized rate ranging from  to  of the daily net assets of the variable account depending on which contract features the contract owner chose � based on the net investment factor the value of an accumulation unit may increase or decrease��changes in the net investment factor may not be directly proportional to changes in the net asset value of the underlying mutual fund shares because of the deduction of variable account charges � though the number of accumulation units will not change as a result of investment experience the value of an accumulation unit may increase or decrease from valuation period to valuation period � transfers prior to annuitization � generally allocations may be transferred among the subaccounts once per valuation period without charges or penalties � frequent trading and transfer restrictions � the contracts sold with this prospectus are designed to support active trading strategies that require frequent movement between or among subaccounts��a contract owner who does not intend to use an active trading strategy should consult hisher

federal tax considerations � federal income taxes � the tax consequences of purchasing a contract described in this prospectus will depend on � ��� the type of contract purchased � ��� the purposes for which the contract is purchased and � ��� the personal circumstances of individual investors having interests in the contracts � existing tax rules are subject to change and may affect individuals differently depending on their situation��nationwide does not guarantee the tax status of any contracts or any transactions involving the contracts � representatives of the internal revenue service have informally suggested from time to time that the number of underlying mutual funds available or the number of transfer opportunities available under a variable product may be relevant in determining whether the product qualifies for the desired tax treatment��in  the internal revenue service issued formal guidance in revenue ruling  that indicates that if the number of underlying mutual funds available in a variable insurance product does not exceed  the number of underlying mutual funds alone would not cause the contract to not qualify for the desired tax treatment��the internal revenue service has also indicated that exceeding  investment options may be considered a factor along with other factors including the number of transfer opportunities available under the contract when determining whether the contract qualifies for the desired tax treatment��the revenue ruling did not indicate the actual number of underlying mutual funds that would cause the contract to not provide the desired tax treatment��should the us secretary of the treasury issue additional rules or regulations limiting the number of underlying mutual funds transfers between underlying mutual funds exchanges of underlying mutual funds or changes in investment objectives of underlying mutual funds such that the contract would no longer qualify for tax deferred treatment under section  of the internal revenue code nationwide will take whatever steps are available to remain in compliance � if the contract is purchased as an investment of certain retirement plans such as qualified retirement plans individual retirement accounts and custodial accounts as described in sections  a and b of the internal revenue code tax advantages enjoyed by the contract owner andor annuitant may relate to participation in the plan rather than ownership of the annuity contract��such plans are permitted to purchase investments other than annuities and retain taxdeferred status � the following is a brief summary of some of the federal income tax considerations related to the contracts��in addition to the federal income tax distributions from annuity contracts may be subject to state and local income taxes��the tax rules across all states and localities are not uniform and therefore will not be discussed in this prospectus��tax rules that may apply to contracts issued in us

contribution is made to any roth ira established for the owner � a qualified distribution is not included in gross income for federal income tax purposes �  � a nonqualified distribution is not includable in gross income to the extent that the distribution when added to all previous distributions does not exceed the total amount of contributions made to the roth ira��any nonqualified

� if the contract owner dies before the contract is completely distributed the balance will be included in the contract owner�s gross estate for tax purposes � nonqualified contracts  natural persons as contract owners � generally the income earned inside a nonqualified annuity contract that is owned by a natural person is not taxable until it is distributed from the contract � distributions before the annuitization date are taxable to the contract owner to the extent that the cash value of the contract exceeds the contract owner�s investment in the contract at the time of the distribution��in general the investment in the contract is equal to the purchase payment made with aftertax dollars��distributions for this purpose include full and partial surrenders any portion of the contract that is assigned or pledged amounts borrowed from the contract or any portion of the contract that is transferred by gift��for these purposes a transfer by gift may occur upon annuitization if the contract owner and the annuitant are not the same individual � with respect to annuity distributions on or after the annuitization date a portion of each annuity payment is excludable from taxable income��the amount excludable is based on the ratio between the contract owner�s investment in the contract and the expected return on the contract��once the entire investment in the contract is recovered all distributions are fully includable in income��the maximum amount excludable from income is the investment in the contract��if the annuitant dies before the entire investment in the contract has been excluded from income and as a result of the annuitants death no more payments are due under the contract then the unrecovered investment in the contract may be deducted on his or her final tax return � in determining the taxable amount of a distribution all annuity contracts issued after october   by the same company to the same contract owner during the same calendar year will be treated as one annuity contract � a special rule applies to distributions from contracts that have investments that were made prior to august  ��for those contracts distributions that are made prior to the annuitization date are treated first as a recovery of the investment in the contract as of that date��a distribution in excess of the amount of the investment in the contract as of august   will be treated as taxable income � the internal revenue code imposes a penalty tax if a distribution is made before the contract owner reaches age ���the amount of the penalty is  of the portion of any distribution that is includable in gross income��the penalty tax does not apply if the distribution is � ��� the result of a contract owner�s death � ��� the result of a contract owner�s disability as defined in the internal revenue code �  � ��� one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the life or life expectancy of the contract owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the contract owner and the beneficiary selected by the contract owner to receive payment under the annuity payment option selected by the contract owner or � ��� is allocable to an investment in the contract before august   � if the contract owner dies before the contract is completely distributed the balance will be included in the contract owner�s gross estate for tax purposes � nonqualified contracts  nonnatural persons as contract owners � the previous discussion related to the taxation of nonqualified contracts owned by individuals��different rules the socalled �nonnatural persons� rules apply if the contract owner is not a natural person � generally contracts owned by corporations partnerships trusts and similar entities are not treated as annuity contracts under the internal revenue code��therefore income earned under a nonqualified contract that is owned by a nonnatural person is taxed as ordinary income during the taxable year that it is earned��taxation is not deferred even if the income is not distributed out of the contract��the income is taxable as ordinary income not capital gain � the nonnatural persons rules do not apply to all entityowned contracts��for purposes of the rule that annuity contracts that are owned by nonnatural persons are not treated as annuity contracts for tax purposes a contract that is owned by a nonnatural person as an agent of an individual is treated as owned by the individual��this would cause the contract to be treated as an annuity under the internal revenue code allowing tax deferral��however this exception does not apply when the nonnatural person is an employer that holds the contract under a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement for one or more employees � the nonnatural persons rules also do not apply to contracts that are � ��� acquired by the estate of a decedent by reason of the death of the decedent � ��� issued in connection with certain qualified retirement plans and individual retirement plans � ��� purchased by an employer upon the termination of certain qualified retirement plans or � ��� immediate annuities within the meaning of section u of the internal revenue code � if the annuitant dies before the contract is completely distributed the balance may be included in the annuitant�s gross estate for tax purposes depending on the obligations that the nonnatural owner may have owed to the annuitant withholding � predeath distributions from the contracts are subject to federal income tax��nationwide will withhold the tax from the distributions unless the contract owner requests otherwise��if the distribution is from a tax sheltered annuity it will be subject to a mandatory  withholding that cannot be waived unless � ��� the distribution is made directly to another tax sheltered annuity qualified pension or profitsharing plan described in section a an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section b which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section ea��or ira or � ��� the distribution satisfies the minimum distribution requirements imposed by the internal revenue code � in addition under some circumstances the internal revenue code will not permit contract owners to waive withholding��such circumstances include � ��� if the payee does not provide nationwide with a taxpayer identification number or � ��� if nationwide receives notice from the internal revenue service that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the payee is incorrect � if a contract owner is prohibited from waiving withholding as described above the distribution will be subject to mandatory backup withholding��the mandatory backup withholding rate is established by section  of the internal revenue code and is applied against the amount of income that is distributed � nonresident aliens � generally a predeath distribution from a contract to a nonresident alien is subject to federal income tax at a rate of  of the amount of income that is distributed��nationwide is required to withhold this amount and send it to the internal revenue service��some distributions to nonresident aliens may be subject to a lower or no tax if a treaty applies��in order to obtain the benefits of such a treaty the nonresident alien must � �� provide nationwide with a properly completed withholding certificate claiming the treaty benefit of a lower tax rate or exemption from tax and � �� provide nationwide with an individual taxpayer identification number � if the nonresident alien does not meet the above conditions nationwide will withhold  of income from the distribution �  � � another exemption from the  withholding is for the nonresident alien to provide nationwide with sufficient evidence that � �� the distribution is connected to the nonresident alien�s conduct of business in the united states � �� the distribution is��includable in the nonresident alien�s gross income for united states federal income tax purposes and � �� provide nationwide with a properly completed withholding certificate claiming the exemption � note that these distributions would be subject to the same withholding rules that are applicable to payments to united states persons including backup withholding which is currently at a rate of  if a correct taxpayer identification number is not provided � federal estate gift and generation skipping transfer taxes � the following transfers may be considered a gift for federal gift tax purposes � ��� a transfer of the contract from one contract owner to another or � ��� a distribution to someone other than a contract owner � upon the contract owner�s death the value of the contract may be subject to estate taxes even if all or a portion of the value is also subject to federal income taxes � section  of the internal revenue code may require nationwide to determine whether a death benefit or other distribution is a �direct skip� and the amount of the resulting generation skipping transfer tax if any��a direct skip is when property is transferred to or a death benefit or other distribution is made to � a�� an individual who is two or more generations younger than the contract owner or � b�� certain trusts as described in section  of the internal revenue code generally trusts that have no beneficiaries who are not  or more generations younger than the contract owner � if the contract owner is not an individual then for this purpose only �contract owner� refers to any person � ��� who would be required to include the contract death benefit distribution or other payment in his or her federal gross estate at his or her death or � ��� who is required to report the transfer of the contract death benefit distribution or other payment for federal gift tax purposes � if a transfer is a direct skip nationwide will deduct the amount of the transfer tax from the death benefit distribution or other payment and remit it directly to the internal revenue service � charge for tax � nationwide is not required to maintain a capital gain reserve liability on nonqualified contracts��if tax laws change requiring a reserve nationwide may implement and adjust a tax charge � diversification � internal revenue code section h contains rules on diversification requirements for variable annuity contracts��a variable annuity contract that does not meet these diversification requirements will not be treated as an annuity unless � ��� the failure to diversify was accidental � ��� the failure is corrected and � ��� a fine is paid to the internal revenue service � the amount of the fine will be the amount of tax that would have been paid by the contract owner if the income for the period the contract was not diversified had been received by the contract owner � if the violation is not corrected the contract owner will be considered the owner of the underlying securities and will be taxed on the earnings of his or her contract��nationwide believes that the investments underlying this contract meet these diversification requirements � tax changes � the foregoing tax information is based on nationwide�s understanding of federal tax laws��it is not intended as tax advice��all information is subject to change without notice��you should consult with your personal tax andor financial adviser for more information � in  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra was enacted��egtrra made numerous
