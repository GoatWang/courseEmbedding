here what is the woodford shale formation  the woodford shale natural gas field  oklahoma shale  is located in southeastern oklahoma  to many oil and gas companies the woodford shale field holds a promising source of natural gas  this natural gas is trapped in the shale rock thousands of feet below the ground  companies first drill vertical wells and then drill horizontally with fracturing techniques which involves fracturing  the shale rock deposits with high pressured water  this then releases the trapped gas  the woodford shale play is the result of what has happened in the barnett shale find for the past  years  companies have gained a vast amount of their experience drilling wells in barnett and can use this experience along with new technologies when they drill in the woodford shale gas fieldover  wells have already been drilled with many more to come  the sweet spots located in the woodford shale are mcintosh county to hughes coal pittsburg and atoka counties  companies are leasing land in order to explore natural gas  in addition these landholders often get up to  royalties on the natural gas found in the woodford shale  fresh news in  marathon oil has announced they are drilling in canadian county okback to horizontal drilling  many years ago companies wouldnt be drilling this woodford shale because of old technologys and the price of natural gas was low  now it makes economic sense  although horizontal wells at woodford shale cost alot more then vertical wells soaring natural gas prices have made these shale plays a gold mine  its a huge frenzy similar to the gold rush  people are becoming millionaires just for leasing their land to natural gas companiesgeologists have know about woodford shale for a long time but companies have only started exploring it ten years ago  drilling only started several years ago  this has boosted the average salary of the citizens from  to near  per year in mcalester  some say if you drive through atoka coalgate and mcalester they are totally transformed  great wealth is being created every yearwhile devon energy drilled the first well back in  many companies have taken over the woodford shale in hopes to strike in big  estimates are coming in that the woodford shale holds around  trillion cubic feet of natural gas  the woodford shale gas field is not the only hot shale play out therecheck

woodford shale anadarko basin oklahoma citation details indocument search title regional geologic characteristics relevant to horizontal drilling woodford shale anadarko basin oklahoma horizontal drilling in the late devonianearly mississippian bakken formation of the williston basin has spurred new interest in other black shales as primary hydrocarbon reservoirs the late devonianearly mississippian woodford shale which is similar in some respects to the bakken formation is a major source of oil and gas in the anadarko basin of oklahoma and could prove to be a significant reservoir rock as well the three regional geologic characteristics of the woodford discussed here are of likely importance to horizontal drilling programs although direct relations to drilling strategy cannot be developed until empirical data from horizontal tests become available first the woodford shale is composed of three distinct depositional units the upper middle and lower informal members with different physical and geochemical properties second a paleotopographic high that was rising before and during woodford deposition divided the woodford shale into northeast and southwest depocenters third woodford depositional patterns are overprinted by thermalmaturity trends shaped primarily by differential burial of the woodford during pennsylvanian and permian time the woodford shale northeast of the forebulge is generally immature to marginally mature whereas its thermal maturity southwest of the forebulge ranges from mature to postmature with respect to oil generation amore » formation resistivity of about  ohmm approximates the updip limit of oilsaturated woodford shale from which free oil might be produced from fracture systems« less authors hester tc  schmoker jw   show
