results came up short of expectations brian feroldi tmftypeoh jul   at pm what happened shares of integra lifesciences nasdaqiart a medical device company that focuses on surgical products fell as much as  in early morning trading on wednesday after the release of secondquarter earnings  so what heres a review of the key metrics from the second quarter revenue grew  to  million for the quarter that figure was a hair shy of the  million that wall street had expected organic revenue growth was only  during the period that represents a slowdown from the  organic revenue growth produced in the first quarter net income was  per share on an adjusted basis  which largely strips out onetime costs related to acquisitions expenses  earnings were  per share that figure matched what analysts had estimated integra ceo peter arduini succinctly summarized the companys quarter results profitability and cash flows were strong in the second quarter while revenues came in at the low end of our guidance range while dural repair underperformed new product introductions and acquisitions performed well giving us confidence that revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of this year arduini also said that the company remains on track to complete its planned acquisition of codman neurosurgery which is a business currently owned by johnson  johnson for  billion in the fourth quarter image source getty images turning to guidance integra tightened its fullyear  revenue guidance to a range of  billion to  billion management also revised its fullyear organic sales growth down to a range of  to  from its prior outlook of  to  the change reflects the recent weakness that it is seeing in dural repair traders appear to be reacting harshly to the disappointing revenue result and lowered organic growth guidance that reaction isnt a surprise when you consider that integras stock had climbed nearly  since the start of the year now what arduini believes that the upcoming codman neurosurgery purchase will be a transformational acquisition for the company given its size i think that is an accurate statement codmans sales totaled about  million in  and it generated an ebitda margin of  so this transaction promises to have a meaningful impact on integras top and bottom lines on the flip side integra plans to fund the acquisition primarily with debt in my view that raises the deals risk profile significantly will the company be able to successfully integrate such a huge acquisition that question remains unanswered however with such a large and risky transaction waiting in the wings i personally plan on avoiding integras stock for the time being brian feroldi has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends johnson
