respectively versus the russell  index’s one year return of  three years of  and five years of  the sp  returned on an annualized basis   and  for the one three and five years respectively contributors contributors for the quarter included technology stocks such as dxc technologies – dxc bps which confirmed an attractive  and beyond guidance benefiting from the completion of hewlett packard enterprises – hpe spin merger to form dxc technologies broadcom ltd – avgo  bps and asml holding nv – asml bps both benefited from earnings surprises to the upside delphi automotive plc – dlph bps beat fourth quarter estimates significantly on both top line growth and margin with better than expected guidance for  huntington ingalls industries inc – hii bps released strong fourth quarter operation results driven by better than expected topline  margin performance in addition shipbuilding received an expected boost in the house version of the budget and supplemental spending detractors detractors were in healthcare specifically envision healthcare corp – evhc – bps missed earnings estimates for the quarter and lowered fiscal year  guidance we held on to envision healthcare the stock appears inexpensive perhaps overly discounting residual operational problems but we are cognizant that they are partly hostage to changes in overall health care spending and federal distribution of funds to the states apple inc – appl bps cost the portfolio a relative  basis points due to our underweight relative to the benchmark energy names such as devon energy corp – dvn – bps underperformed due to weak oil prices as inventory data in the us continued to disappoint bank of new york mellon corp – bk – bps as the investment management segment was weaker than expected which was attributed to forex translation fixed income and relatively weaker postelection positioning we sold bank of new york mellon corp as we saw the potential for increased price competition in their basic custodial services westinghouse air brake technologies corp – wab – bps as  guidance was lower than expected due to the delays in freight aftermarket recovery we continue to hold westinghouse air brake technologies as we think rail traffic will pick up beyond the sluggish fourth quarter pace concerns  outlook after the strong stock market performance we see risk to the downside for equities we believe the markets are already pricing in some expectations of tax cuts infrastructure spending and potential business stimulus from deregulation while these expectations may come to fruition there are clearly concerns regarding the trump administration’s ability to pass any meaningful legislation combined with geopolitical instabilities in korea syria france and russia along with the ever present threat of terrorist disruptions further gains in stocks might be limited going forward we believe these concerns will pass as the administration has already met with russia regarding syria and china regarding north korea to ease tensions and the french election should result in little change in the country’s position within the eu while there will not likely be expedient action in congress regarding tax reform and infrastructure spending the economy is on sounder footing and the urgency for monetary stimulus has diminished and in fact a late timeframe for action would drive a strong start to the economy into the new year with this steady job creation improved business optimism and a solid us consumer balance sheet we see steady growth ahead         portfolio commentary is based
