capital appreciation invests primarily in equitybased portfolios designed to provide higher growth potential while maintaining risk at a reasonable level allocation moderate growth longterm capital appreciation focuses on equity investing to help maximize growth potential but also invests a portion of its assets in the bond market for income allocation moderate longterm capital appreciation combines equity investing with increased and moderate current income exposure to fixed income investing designed for investors who want growth but who are also seeking a moderate level of income allocation balanced longterm capital appreciation offers the greatest exposure to fixed income and income designed for investors who need greater balance of growth potential and current income  if you invest in a seasons managed allocation portfolio you pay the expenses of the seasons managed allocation portfolio and indirectly pay a proportionate share of the expenses of the underlying funds in which the seasons managed allocation portfolio invests as a result you will pay higher fees and expenses under the fundoffunds structure than if you invested directly in each of the underlying funds held in the fundoffunds structure seasons strategies each seasons strategy has a different investment objective and is a variable portfolio of the separate account that invests in three underlying funds the allocation of money among these underlying funds varies depending on the objective of the seasons strategy the seasons strategies are designed utilizing an asset allocation approach to meet your investment needs over time considering factors such as your age goals and risk tolerance however each seasons strategy is designed to achieve different levels of growth over time the three underlying funds in which a seasons strategy can invest are detailed in the pie chart on the following page the underlying funds comprising the seasons strategies may only be purchased by the seasons strategies the seasons strategies use an investment approach based on asset allocation this approach is achieved by each seasons strategy investing in distinct percentages in three specific underlying funds in turn the underlying funds invest in a combination of domestic and international stocks bonds and cash the goal for each seasons strategy is to have a specified asset mix of stocks bonds and cash in accordance with the specified objective of the seasons strategy and relative to the underlying funds in which the seasons strategy invests the stated target asset allocation percentages and the mix of underlying funds comprising each seasons strategy do not change for the life of the contract please see the seasons series trust prospectus which describes in detail the underlying funds that comprise each seasons strategy seasons strategy rebalancing each quarter a rebalancing occurs among the underlying funds of the season strategies to realign each seasons strategy with its distinct percentage investment detailed below this rebalancing is designed to help maintain the asset allocation mix for each seasons strategy the pie charts on the following page demonstrate the asset allocation mix for each seasons strategy and the percentage allocation of each underlying fund in which the seasons strategy invests before the end of each quarter or as close to such date as is

allocation program may be offered to you at no additional cost to assist in diversifying your investment across various asset classes the strategic allocation program allows you to choose from one of the four strategic allocations designed to assist in meeting your stated investment goals each of the strategic allocations allocate  of your investment in a strategic model and the remaining  in a seasons managed allocation portfolio to attempt to match a stated investment time horizon and risk tolerance the primary allocation each strategic model is comprised of a combination of variable portfolios the secondary allocation each seasons managed allocation portfolio is a fundoffunds the  of your investment allocated to the strategic model is considered static because the composition of the strategic model will not be changed by us and is not actively managed however the  of your investment allocated to the seasons managed allocation portfolio is considered active because each seasons managed allocation portfolio is a variable portfolio that an investment adviser continuously manages in order to maintain the investment objective of the seasons managed allocation portfolio for more information please see seasons managed allocation portfolios above enrolling and investing in the strategic allocation program you may enroll in the strategic allocation program by selecting a strategic allocation on the contract application form you and your financial representative should determine the strategic allocation most appropriate for you based on your financial needs risk tolerance and investment time horizon you may request to discontinue the use of a strategic allocation by sending a written request calling our annuity service center or logging onto our website you may also choose to invest gradually into a strategic allocation through the dca program please see the dollar cost averaging program above you may only invest in one strategic allocation at a time and participation in the strategic allocation program requires that you invest  of your initial purchase payment and subsequent purchase payments in a strategic allocation if you attempt to split your investment in one or more strategic allocations your investment may no longer be consistent with the strategic allocations intended objectives additionally if you invest in any variable portfolios in addition to investing in a strategic allocation such an investment may no longer be consistent with the strategic allocations intended objectives you can transfer  of your investment from one strategic allocation to a different strategic allocation at any time withdrawals you may request withdrawals as permitted by your contract which will be taken proportionately from each of the variable portfolios in the strategic allocation unless otherwise indicated in your withdrawal instructions if you choose to make a nonproportional withdrawal from the variable portfolios in the strategic allocation your investment may no longer be consistent with the strategic allocations intended objectives withdrawals may also be taxable and a  irs penalty may apply if you are under age   rebalancing you can elect to have your investment in the strategic allocations rebalanced quarterly semiannually or annually to maintain the target asset allocation among the variable portfolios of the strategic allocation you selected if you make such an election to rebalance both the primary allocation and the secondary allocation will be rebalanced to equal the  split discussed above the target allocations of the underlying funds of each seasons managed allocation portfolio are not rebalanced as part of the strategic allocation program please see seasons managed allocation portfolios above over time the strategic allocation may no longer align with its original investment objective due to the effects of variable portfolio performance changes in the variable portfolios and the everchanging investment markets therefore if you do not elect to have your investment in the strategic allocation rebalanced at least annually then your investment may no longer be consistent with the strategic allocations intended objectives in addition your investment needs may change  if you elect certain optional living benefits you will automatically be enrolled in the automatic asset rebalancing program and your contract will be rebalanced in accordance with the investment requirements of the living benefit please see optional living benefits below important information about the strategic allocation program the strategic allocation program is not intended as ongoing or personalized advice about investing in the variable portfolios we do not provide investment advice regarding whether a strategic allocation should be selected or rebalanced or whether it remains appropriate for any individual to invest in accordance with any particular strategic allocation as your investment needs change the strategic allocation program does not guarantee greater or more consistent returns future market and asset class performance may differ from the historical performance upon which the strategic allocations may have been built also allocation to a single asset class may outperform a strategic allocation so that you could have better investment returns investing in a single asset class than in a strategic allocation however such a strategy may involve a greater degree of risk because of the concentration of similar securities in a single asset class further there can be no assurance that any variable portfolio chosen for a particular strategic allocation will perform well or that its performance will closely reflect that of the asset class it is designed to represent the strategic allocations represent suggested allocations that are provided to you as general guidance you should work with your financial representative in determining if one of the strategic allocations meets your financial needs investment time horizon and is consistent with your risk tolerance level information concerning the specific strategic allocations can be obtained from your

for new contracts once you invest in a strategic model the percentages of your contract value allocated to each variable portfolio within the strategic model will not be changed by us you should speak with  your financial representative about how to keep the variable portfolio allocations in each strategic allocation in line with your investment goals substitution addition or deletion of variable portfolios we may subject to any applicable law make certain changes to the variable portfolios offered in your contract we may offer new variable portfolios or stop offering existing variable portfolios new variable portfolios may be made available to existing contract owners and variable portfolios may be closed to new or subsequent purchase payments transfers or allocations in addition we may also liquidate the shares of any variable portfolio substitute the shares of one underlying fund held by a variable portfolio for another andor merge variable portfolio or cooperate in a merger of underlying funds to the extent required by the investment company act of  we may be required to obtain sec approval or your approval fixed accounts your contract may offer fixed accounts for varying guarantee periods a fixed account may be available for differing lengths of time such as   or  years each guarantee period may have different guaranteed interest rates we guarantee that the interest rate credited to amounts allocated to any fixed account guarantee periods will never be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in your contract once the rate is established it will not change for the duration of the guarantee period we determine which if any guarantee periods will be offered at any time in our sole discretion unless state law requires us to do otherwise please check with your financial representative regarding the availability of fixed accounts there are three categories of interest rates for money allocated to the fixed accounts the applicable rate is guaranteed until the corresponding guarantee period expires with each category of interest rate your money may be credited a different rate as follows  initial rate the rate credited to any portion of the initial purchase payment allocated to a fixed account  current rate the rate credited to any portion of a subsequent purchase payment allocated to a fixed account  renewal rate the rate credited to money transferred from a fixed account or a variable portfolio into a fixed account and to money remaining in a fixed account after expiration of a guarantee period when a guarantee period ends you may leave your money in the same fixed account or you may reallocate your money to another fixed account or to the variable portfolios if you do not want to leave your money in the same fixed account you must contact us within  days after the end of the guarantee period and provide us with new allocation instructions we do not contact you if you do not contact us your money will remain in the same fixed account where it will earn interest at the renewal rate then in effect for that fixed account we reserve the right to defer payments for a withdrawal from a fixed account for up to six months please see access to your money below if available you may systematically transfer interest earned in available fixed accounts into any of the variable portfolios on certain periodic schedules offered by us systematic transfers may be started changed or terminated at any time by contacting our annuity service center check with your financial representative about the current availability of this service at any time we are crediting the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in your contract we reserve the right to restrict your ability to make transfers and purchase payments into the fixed accounts all fixed accounts may not be available in your state please check with your financial representative regarding the availability of fixed accounts dollar cost averaging fixed accounts you may invest initial andor subsequent purchase payments in the dollar cost averaging dca fixed accounts if available the minimum purchase payment that you must invest for the month dca fixed account is  and for the month dca fixed account is  purchase payments less than these  minimum amounts will automatically be allocated to the variable portfolios according to your instructions or your current allocation instruction on file dca fixed accounts credit a fixed rate of interest and can only be elected to facilitate a dca program please see dollar cost averaging program below for more information interest is credited to amounts allocated to the dca fixed accounts while your money is transferred to the variable portfolios over certain specified time frames the interest rates applicable to the dca fixed accounts may differ from those applicable to any other fixed account but will never be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in your contract however when using a dca fixed account the annual interest rate is paid on a declining balance as you systematically transfer your money to the variable portfolios therefore the actual effective yield will be less than the stated annual crediting rate we reserve the right to change the availability of dca fixed accounts offered unless state law requires us to do otherwise dollar cost averaging program the dca program allows you to invest gradually in the variable portfolios at no additional cost under the program you systematically transfer a specified dollar amount or percentage of contract value from a variable portfolio fixed account or dca fixed account source account to any other variable portfolio target account transfers occur on a monthly periodic schedule the minimum transfer amount under the dca program is  per transaction regardless of the source account fixed accounts are not available as target accounts for the dca program transfers resulting from your participation in the dca program are not counted towards the number of free transfers per contract year we may also offer dca fixed accounts as source accounts exclusively to facilitate the dca program for a specified time period the dca fixed accounts only accept initial or subsequent purchase payments you may not make a transfer from a variable portfolio or fixed account into a dca fixed account if you choose to allocate subsequent purchase payments to an active dca program with a fixed account serving as the source account the rate applicable to that fixed account at the time we receive the subsequent purchase payment will apply further we will begin transferring that subsequent purchase payment into your target allocations on the same day of the month as the initial active dca program therefore you may not receive a full  days of interest prior to the first transfer to the target accounts you may terminate the dca program at any time if you terminate the dca program and money remains in the dca fixed accounts we transfer the remaining money according to your current allocation instructions on file the dca program is designed to lessen the impact of market fluctuations on your investment however the dca program can neither guarantee a profit nor protect your investment against a loss when you elect the dca program you are continuously investing in securities fluctuating at different price levels you should consider your tolerance for investing through periods of fluctuating price levels example of dca program assume that you want to move  each month from one variable portfolio to another variable portfolio over six months you set up a dca program and purchase accumulation units at the following values  month accumulation unit units purchased                          you paid an average price of only  per accumulation unit over six months while the average market price actually was  by investing an equal amount of money each month you automatically buy more accumulation units when the market price is low and fewer accumulation units when the market price is high this example is for illustrative purposes only we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate the dca program at any time  transfers during the accumulation phase subject to our rules restrictions and policies described below during the accumulation phase you may transfer funds between the variable portfolios andor any fixed accounts by telephone  nysun through the companys website wwwaigsunamericacom or in writing by mail or facsimile all transfer instructions submitted via facsimile must be sent to   otherwise they will not be considered received by us we may accept transfers by telephone or the internet if you complete and send the telephone transfer agreement form to our annuity service center when receiving instructions over the telephone or the internet we have procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the transactions executed are genuine thus we are not responsible for any claim loss or expense from any error resulting from instructions received over the telephone or the internet if we fail to follow our procedures we may be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions any transfer request will be priced as of the day it is received by us in good order if the request is received before market close if the transfer request is received after market close the request will be priced as of the next business day funds already in your contract cannot be transferred into the dca fixed accounts you must transfer at least  per transfer if less than  remains in any variable portfolio after a transfer that amount must be transferred as well there is no charge for your first  transfers we charge for transfers in excess of  in any contract year the fee is  for each transfer exceeding this limit transfers resulting from your participation in the dca or automatic asset rebalancing programs are not counted towards the number of free transfers per contract year shortterm trading policies we do not want to issue this variable annuity contract to contract owners engaged in trading strategies that seek to benefit from shortterm price fluctuations or price inefficiencies in the variable portfolios of this product shortterm trading and we discourage shortterm trading as more fully described below however we cannot always anticipate if a potential contract owner intends to engage in shortterm trading shortterm trading may create risks that may result in adverse effects on investment return of the underlying fund in which a variable portfolio invests such risks may include but are not limited to  interference with the management and planned investment strategies of an underlying fund  dilution of the interests in the underlying fund due to practices such as arbitrage andor  increased brokerage and administrative costs due to forced and unplanned fund turnover these circumstances may reduce the value of the variable portfolio in addition to negatively impacting the owner a reduction in contract value may also be harmful to annuitants andor beneficiaries we have adopted the following administrative procedures to discourage shortterm trading which are summarized below the first  transfers in a rolling month lookback period month rolling period can be made by telephone through the companys website or in writing by mail or by facsimile the th transfer in a month rolling period triggers the us mail method of transfer therefore once you make the th transfer in a month rolling period all transfers must be submitted by united states postal service firstclass mail us mail for  months from the date of your th transfer request standard us mail policy for example if you made a transfer on august   and within the previous six months from february   forward you made  transfers including the august th transfer then all transfers made for twelve months after august   must be submitted by us mail from august   through august   us mail includes any us postal service delivery method that offers delivery no sooner than us postal service firstclass mail as determined in the companys sole discretion we will not accept transfer requests sent by any medium except us mail during this month period transfer requests required to be submitted by us mail can only be cancelled by a written request sent by us mail with the appropriate paperwork received prior to the execution of the transfer all transfers made on the same day prior to market close are considered one transfer request for purposes of applying the shortterm trading policy and calculating the number of free transfers transfers resulting from your  participation in the dca or automatic asset rebalancing programs are not included for the purposes of determining the number of transfers before applying the standard us mail policy we apply the standard us mail policy uniformly and consistently to all contract owners except for omnibus group contracts as described below we believe that the standard us mail policy is a sufficient deterrent to shortterm trading however we may become aware of transfer patterns among the variable portfolios andor fixed accounts which appear to be shortterm trading or otherwise detrimental to the variable portfolios but have not yet triggered the limitations of the standard us mail policy described above if such transfer activity comes to our attention we may require you to adhere to our standard us mail policy prior to reaching the specified number of transfers accelerated us mail policy to the extent we become aware of shortterm trading activities which cannot be reasonably controlled solely by the standard us mail policy or the accelerated us mail policy we reserve the right to evaluate in our sole discretion whether to  impose further limits on the size manner number andor frequency of transfers you can make  impose minimum holding periods  reject any purchase payment or transfer request  terminate your transfer privileges andor  request that you surrender your contract we will notify you in writing if your transfer privileges are terminated in addition we reserve the right not to accept or otherwise restrict transfers from a third party acting for you and not to accept preauthorized transfer forms some of the factors we may consider when determining whether to accelerate the standard us mail policy reject transfers or impose other conditions on transfer privileges include  the number of transfers made in a defined period  the dollar amount of the transfer  the total assets of the variable portfolio involved in the transfer andor transfer requests that represent a significant portion of the total assets of the variable portfolio  the investment objectives andor asset classes of the particular variable portfolio involved in your transfers  whether the transfer appears to be part of a pattern of transfers to take advantage of shortterm market fluctuations or market inefficiencies  the history of transfer activity in the contract or in other contracts we may offer andor  other activity as determined by us that creates an appearance real or perceived of shortterm trading or the possibility of shortterm trading notwithstanding the administrative procedures above there are limitations on the effectiveness of these procedures our ability to detect andor deter shortterm trading is limited by operational systems and technological limitations as well as our ability to predict strategies employed by contract owners or those acting on their behalf to avoid detection we cannot guarantee that we will detect andor deter all short term trading and it is likely that some level of shortterm trading will occur before it is detected and steps are taken to deter it to the extent that we are unable to detect andor deter shortterm trading the variable portfolios may be negatively impacted as described above additionally the variable portfolios may be harmed by transfer activity related to other insurance companies andor retirement plans or other investors that invest in shares of the underlying fund moreover our ability to deter shortterm trading may be limited by decisions by state regulatory bodies and court orders which we cannot predict you should be aware that the design of our administrative procedures involves inherently subjective decisions which we attempt to make in a fair and reasonable manner consistent with the interests of all owners of this contract we do not enter into agreements with contract owners whereby we permit or intentionally disregard shortterm trading the standard and accelerated us mail policies are applied uniformly and consistently to contract owners utilizing third party trading servicesstrategies performing asset allocation services for a number of contract owners at the same time you should be aware that such third party trading services may engage in transfer activities that can also be detrimental to the variable portfolios including trading relatively large groups of contracts simultaneously these transfer activities may not be intended to take advantage of shortterm price fluctuations or price inefficiencies however such activities can create the same or similar risks as shortterm trading and negatively impact the variable portfolios as described above  omnibus group contracts may invest in the same underlying funds available in your contract but on an aggregate not individual basis thus we have limited ability to detect shortterm trading in omnibus group contracts and the standard us mail policy does not apply to these contracts our inability to detect shortterm trading may negatively impact the variable portfolios as described above we reserve the right to modify the policies and procedures described in this section at any time to the extent that we exercise this reservation of rights we will do so uniformly and consistently unless we disclose otherwise underlying funds shortterm trading policies please note that the underlying funds have their own policies and procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of their respective shares we reserve the right to enforce these underlying fund policies and procedures including but not limited to the right to collect a redemption fee on shares of the underlying fund if imposed by such funds board of trusteesdirectors as of the date of this prospectus none of the underlying funds impose a redemption fee we also reserve the right to reject with or without prior notice any purchase transfer or allocation into a variable portfolio if the corresponding underlying fund will not accept such purchase transfer or allocation for any reason the prospectuses for the underlying funds describe these procedures which may be different among underlying funds and may be more or less restrictive than our policies and procedures under rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission we also have written agreements with the underlying funds that obligate us to among other things provide the underlying funds promptly upon request certain information about you eg your social security number and your trading activity in addition we are obligated to execute instructions from the underlying funds to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers in an underlying fund under certain circumstances many investments in the underlying funds outside of this contract are omnibus orders from intermediaries such as other separate accounts or retirement plans if an underlying funds policies and procedures fail to successfully detect and discourage shortterm trading there may be a negative impact to the owners of the underlying fund if an underlying fund believes that an omnibus order we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from owners engaged in shortterm trading the underlying fund may reject the entire omnibus order and delay or prevent us from implementing your transfer request transfers during the income phase during the income phase only one transfer per month is permitted between the variable portfolios no other transfers are allowed during the income phase transfers will be effected for the last nyse business day of the month in which we receive your request for the transfer automatic asset rebalancing program market fluctuations may cause the percentage of your investment in the variable portfolios to differ from your original allocations under the automatic asset rebalancing program your investments in the variable portfolios are periodically rebalanced to return your allocations to the percentages given at your last instruction for no additional charge automatic asset rebalancing typically involves shifting a portion of your money out of a variable portfolio with a higher return into a variable portfolio with a lower return at your request rebalancing occurs on a quarterly semiannual or annual basis transfers resulting from your participation in this program are not counted against the number of free transfers per contract year if you elect certain optional living benefits we will automatically enroll you in the automatic asset rebalancing program with quarterly rebalancing please see marketlock income plus and marketlock for life plus below if you make an internet transfer on our website and you have not elected certain optional living benefits the automatic asset rebalancing program will be terminated example of automatic asset rebalancing program assume that you want your initial purchase payment split between two variable portfolios you want  in a bond variable portfolio and  in a stock variable portfolio over the next calendar quarter the bond market does very well while the stock market performs poorly at the end of the calendar quarter the bond variable portfolio now represents  of your holdings because it has increased in value and the growth  variable portfolio represents  of your holdings if you chose quarterly rebalancing on the last day of that quarter we would sell some of your accumulation units in the bond variable portfolio to bring its holdings back to  and use the money to buy more accumulation units in the stock variable portfolio to increase those holdings to  we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate the automatic asset rebalancing program at any time return plus program the return plus program available only if we are offering multiyear fixed accounts allows you to invest in one or more variable portfolios without directly putting your purchase payment at risk the program available for no additional charge accomplishes this by allocating your investment strategically between the fixed accounts and variable portfolios you decide how much you want to invest and approximately when you want a return of purchase payments we calculate how much of your purchase payment to allocate to the particular fixed account to ensure that it grows to an amount equal to your total purchase payment invested under this program we invest the rest of your purchase payment in the variable portfolios according to your allocation instructions example of return plus program assume that you want to allocate a portion of your initial purchase payment of  to a multiyear fixed account you want the amount allocated to the multiyear fixed account to grow to  in  years if the year fixed account is offering a  interest rate return plus will allocate  to the year fixed account to ensure that this amount will grow to  at the end of the year period the remaining  may be allocated among the variable portfolios according to your allocation instructions we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate the return plus program at any time voting rights the company is the legal owner of the trusts shares however when an underlying fund solicits proxies in conjunction with a shareholder vote we must obtain your instructions on how to vote those shares we vote all of the shares we own in proportion to your instructions this includes any shares we own on our own behalf should we determine that we are no longer required to comply with these rules we will vote the shares in our own right access to your money you can access money in your contract by making a partial or total withdrawal andor by receiving annuity income payments during the income phase please see annuity income options below any request for withdrawal will be priced as of the day it is received by us in good order if the request is received before market close if the request for withdrawal is received after market close the request will be priced as of the next business day generally we deduct a withdrawal charge applicable to any partial or total withdrawal made before the end of the withdrawal charge period if you surrender your contract we also deduct a contract maintenance fee if applicable please see expenses below if you have elected an optional living benefit you should consider the impact of your withdrawals on the benefit please see optional living benefits below free withdrawal provision your contract provides for a free withdrawal amount each year a free withdrawal amount as defined below is the portion of your contract that we allow you to take out each year without being charged a withdrawal charge the free withdrawal amount does not reduce the basis used to calculate future annual free withdrawals or the withdrawal charges applicable upon a full surrender of your contract as a result if you surrender your contract in the future and withdrawal charges are still applicable you will not receive the benefit of any previous free withdrawals upon a full surrender  withdrawals of purchase payments made prior to the end of the withdrawal charge schedule that are in excess of your free withdrawal amount will result in a withdrawal charge the amount of the withdrawal charge and how it applies are discussed more fully in the expenses section below before purchasing this contract you should consider the effect of withdrawal charges on your investment if you need to withdraw more money than the free withdrawal amount you should fully discuss this decision with your financial representative to determine your free withdrawal amount and your withdrawal charge we refer to two special terms penalty free earnings and total invested amount penaltyfree earnings are equal to your contract value less your total invested amount and may be withdrawn free of a withdrawal charge at any time including upon a full surrender of your contract purchase payments that are no longer subject to a withdrawal and not previously withdrawn may also be withdrawn free of a withdrawal charge at any time the total invested amount is the sum of all purchase payments less portions of prior withdrawals that reduce your total invested amount as follows  free withdrawals in any year that were in excess of your penaltyfree earnings and were based on the portion of the total invested amount that was no longer subject to withdrawal charges at the time of the withdrawal and  any prior withdrawals including withdrawal charges applicable to those withdrawals of the total invested amount on which you already paid a withdrawal charge when you make a withdrawal we deduct it from penaltyfree earnings first any remaining penaltyfree withdrawal amount and then from the total invested amount on a firstin firstout basis this means that you can also access your purchase payments which are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge before those purchase payments that are still subject to the withdrawal charge during the first year after we issue your contract your free withdrawal amount is the greater of  your penaltyfree earnings or  if you are participating in the systematic withdrawal program a total of  of your total invested amount after the first contract year your annual free withdrawal amount is the greater of  your penaltyfree earnings and any portion of your total invested amount no longer subject to a withdrawal charge or   of the portion of your total invested amount that has been in your contract for at least one year although amounts withdrawn free of a withdrawal charge under the  provision may reduce purchase payments for purposes of calculating amounts available for future withdrawals of earnings they do not reduce the amount you invested for purposes of calculating the withdrawal charge if you surrender your contract as a result if you surrender your contract in the future and withdrawal charges are still applicable any previous free withdrawals would then be subject to applicable withdrawal charges we calculate charges upon surrender of the contract on the day after we receive your request and your contract we return to you your contract value less any applicable fees and charges when you make a withdrawal we return the portion of contract value withdrawn less any applicable fees and charges the withdrawal charge percentage is determined by the number of years the purchase payment has been in the contract at the time of the withdrawal please see expenses below for the purpose of calculating the withdrawal charge any prior free withdrawal is not subtracted from the total purchase payments still subject to withdrawal charges for example you make an initial purchase payment of  for purposes of this example we will assume a  growth rate over the life of the contract and no subsequent purchase payments in contract year  you take  out your maximum free withdrawal of  after that free withdrawal your contract value is  in the th contract year you request a total withdrawal of your contract we will apply the following calculation ab x c  d where ayour contract value at the time of your request for withdrawal  bthe amount of your purchase payments still subject to withdrawal charge  cthe withdrawal charge percentage applicable to the age of each purchase payment assuming  is the applicable percentage b x c   dyour contract value  available for total withdrawal under most circumstances the partial withdrawal minimum is  we require that the value left in any variable portfolio or fixed accounts be at least  after the withdrawal and your total contract value must be at least  the request for withdrawal must be in writing for withdrawals of  and more you must submit a signature guarantee at the time of your request unless you provide us with different instructions partial withdrawals will be made proportionately from each variable portfolio and the fixed account in which you are invested in the event that a proportionate partial withdrawal would cause the value of any variable portfolio or fixed account investment to be less than  we will contact you to obtain alternate instructions on how to structure the withdrawal withdrawals made prior to age   may result in a  irs penalty tax please see taxes below under certain qualified plans access to the money in your contract may be restricted we may be required to suspend or postpone the payment of a withdrawal for any period of time when  the nyse is closed other than a customary weekend and holiday closings  trading with the nyse is restricted  an emergency exists such that disposal of or determination of the value of shares of the variable portfolios is not reasonably practicable  the sec by order so permits for the protection of contract owners additionally we reserve the right to defer payments for a withdrawal from a fixed account for up to six months systematic withdrawal program during the accumulation phase you may elect to receive periodic withdrawals under the systematic withdrawal program for no additional charge under the program you may choose to take monthly quarterly semiannual or annual payments from your contract electronic transfer of these withdrawals to your bank account is also available the minimum amount of each withdrawal is  there must be at least  remaining in your contract at all times withdrawals may be taxable and a  federal penalty tax may apply if you are

reorganizations at least  days in advance  how are the components for marketlock income plus calculated first we determine the eligible purchase payments which include   of purchase payments received during the first contract year and  purchase payments received in each of contract years  capped in each year at an amount equal to  of the purchase payments received in year  this means that if you made a  purchase payment in year  eligible purchase payments will include additional purchase payments of up to  contributed in each of contract years  for a grand total maximum of  of eligible purchase payments any purchase payments made in contract years  in excess of the annual cap amount as well as all purchase payments received after the th contract year are considered ineligible purchase payments the calculation of eligible purchase payments does not include any spousal continuation contributions however continuation contributions are included in the calculation of anniversary values as defined below please see spousal continuation below total eligible purchase payments are limited to  without our prior company approval second we consider the income credit period and the income base evaluation period the income credit period is the period of time over which we calculate the income credit the income base evaluation period is the period of time over which we consider anniversary values and if applicable and greater the income base plus any available income credit the initial income credit period and the initial income base evaluation period begin on the effective date and end  years later you may elect to extend both the income base evaluation period and the income credit period at the end of the initial income base evaluation period and initial income credit period and after election of the first extension you may elect a second extension subsequent extensions apply to only the income base evaluation period please see can i extend the income base evaluation period and income credit period beyond  years below third we determine the anniversary value which equals your contract value on any contract anniversary during the income base evaluation period minus any ineligible purchase payments fourth we determine the income base which initially is equal to the first eligible purchase payment if the feature is elected after contract issue the initial income base is the contract value on the effective date in each subsequent benefit year the income base equals the income base at the beginning of the benefit year plus any subsequent eligible purchase payments made during that benefit year less proportionate adjustments for excess withdrawals that occurred during that benefit year on each benefit year anniversary we determine if the income base should be increased based on the maximum anniversary value or any available income credit as defined below please see how can the income base and income credit base be increased andwhat are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock income plus below fifth we determine the income credit base which is used solely as a basis for calculating the income credit during an income credit period the initial income credit base is equal to the first eligible purchase payment if the feature is elected after contract issue the initial income credit base is the contract value on the effective date please see how can the income base and income credit base be increased below sixth we determine the income credit which is an amount equal to  income credit percentage of the income credit base on each benefit year anniversary if you take withdrawals in a benefit year that are less than or equal to the maximum annual withdrawal amount the income credit percentage on the benefit year anniversary is reduced by a percentage calculated as the sum of all withdrawals taken during the preceding benefit year divided by the income base prior to the determining the income base for the next benefit year if you take a withdrawal that is greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount in the preceding benefit year the income credit is equal to zero please see the optional living benefits examples appendix below finally we determine the maximum annual withdrawal amount which represents the maximum amount that may be withdrawn each benefit year following the effective date without reducing the income base and if applicable the income credit base the maximum annual withdrawal amount is calculated by multiplying the income base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage shown in the tables above please see how do increases and decreases in the income base impact the maximum annual withdrawal amount below  how can the income base and income credit base be increased on each benefit year anniversary during an income base evaluation period we determine if the income base should be increased based on the maximum anniversary value or any available income credit maximum anniversary value equals the highest anniversary value on any benefit year anniversary occurring during an income base evaluation period on each benefit year anniversary during an income base evaluation period the income base is automatically increased to the anniversary value when the anniversary value is greater than a b and c where a is the cumulative eligible purchase payments and b is the current income base increased by the income credit if any and c is all previous anniversary values during any income base evaluation period on each benefit year anniversary during the income credit period we determine the amount to which the income credit base andor the income base could increase the components used to determine this amount are a the income base calculated based on the maximum anniversary value and b the current income base plus the income credit if a is greater than or equal to b the income credit base and the income base are increased to the current anniversary value if b is greater than a the income base is increased by the income credit and the income credit base remains unchanged increases to your income base occur on benefit year anniversaries as described above your income base will not increase even if your contract value on days other than the benefit year anniversary was greater than your income base on the benefit year anniversary the income base evaluation period and the income credit period can both be extended at the first extension and if you elected the first extension at the second extension only the income base evaluation period can be extended on subsequent extensions in addition the income base and if applicable the income credit base can also be increased to at least the minimum income base on the th benefit year anniversary provided no withdrawals are taken prior to that anniversary if you are eligible for the minimum income base the income base on the th benefit year anniversary is the greatest of a b and c where a is the current income base or if the first extension was elected the income base calculated based on the maximum anniversary value and b is the current income base plus the income credit if applicable and c is the minimum income base on your th benefit year anniversary if you are eligible for the minimum income base and if the first extension is elected the income credit base is the greatest of a b and c where a is the income base calculated based on the maximum anniversary value and b is the current income credit base and c is the minimum income base how do increases and decreases in the income base impact the maximum annual withdrawal amount increases in the income base in any benefit year where eligible purchase payments are allocated to your contract any remaining withdrawals of the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be based on the increased maximum annual withdrawal amount reduced by withdrawals previously taken in that benefit year if the income base is increased on a benefit year anniversary the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated on that benefit year anniversary by multiplying the increased income base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage  decreases in the income base excess withdrawals reduce your income base on the date the excess withdrawal occurs any excess withdrawal in a benefit year reduces the income base in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the excess withdrawal please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock income plus below as a result of a reduction of the income base the new maximum annual withdrawal amount will be equal to the reduced income base multiplied by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage the last recalculated maximum annual withdrawal amount in a given benefit year is available for withdrawal at the beginning of the next benefit year and may be lower than your previously calculated maximum annual withdrawal amount when the contract value is less than the income base excess withdrawals will reduce the income base by an amount which is greater than the amount of the excess withdrawal in addition no income credit will be added to the income base in that benefit year what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock income plus the maximum annual withdrawal amount the income base and income credit base may change over time as a result of the timing and amount of withdrawals if you take a withdrawal before the th benefit year anniversary your income base and if applicable the income credit base are not eligible to be increased to the minimum income base you may take withdrawals during a contract year that in total are less than or equal to the maximum annual withdrawal amount which will not reduce the income base or income credit base however if you choose to take less than the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any contract year you may not carry over the unused amount into subsequent years your maximum annual withdrawal amount will not be recalculated solely as a result of taking less than the entire maximum annual withdrawal amount in any given year withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount are considered excess withdrawals we define excess withdrawals as any portion of a withdrawal that causes the total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount including but not limited to any withdrawal in a contract year taken after the maximum annual withdrawal amount has been withdrawn you should not elect this feature if you plan to take excess withdrawals since those withdrawals may significantly reduce or eliminate the value of the feature the impact of withdrawals and the effect on certain components of marketlock income plus are further explained below income base and income credit base if the sum of withdrawals in any benefit year exceeds the maximum annual withdrawal amount the income base and income credit base will be reduced for those withdrawals for each excess withdrawal taken the income base and income credit base are reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by each excess withdrawal maximum annual withdrawal amount the maximum annual withdrawal amount is recalculated each time there is a change in the income base accordingly if the sum of withdrawals in any contract year does not exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that year the maximum annual withdrawal amount will not change for the next year unless your income base is increased as described above under how are the components for marketlock income plus calculated if you take an excess withdrawal the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated by multiplying the reduced income base by the existing maximum annual withdrawal percentage this recalculated maximum annual withdrawal amount is available for withdrawal at the beginning of the next benefit year and may be lower than your previous maximum annual withdrawal amount please remember that all withdrawals including withdrawals taken under this feature reduce your contract value and your death benefit and may reduce other benefits under the contract in addition withdrawals under this feature will reduce the free withdrawal amount and may be subject to applicable withdrawal charges if in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount please see access to your money above and expenses below the optional living benefits examples appendix provides examples of the effects of

investment requirements for any existing contract to the extent variable portfolios andor fixed accounts are added deleted substituted merged or otherwise reorganized we will notify you of any changes to the investment requirements at least  days in advance how are the components for marketlock for life plus calculated first we determine the eligible purchase payments which include   of purchase payments received during the first contract year and  purchase payments received in each of contract years  capped in each year at an amount equal to  of the purchase payments received in year  this means that if you made a  purchase payment in year  eligible purchase payments will include additional purchase payments of up to  contributed in each of contract years  for a grand total maximum of  of eligible purchase payments if the feature is elected after contract issue purchase payments received from the effective date through contract year  are capped in each year at an amount equal to  of the purchase payments received during the first contract year any purchase payments made in contract years  in excess of the annual cap amount as well as all purchase payments received after the th contract year are considered ineligible purchase payments the calculation of eligible purchase payments does not include any spousal continuation contributions however continuation contributions are included in the calculation of anniversary values as defined below please see spousal continuation below total eligible purchase payments are limited to  without our prior company approval  second we consider the income credit period and the income base evaluation period the income credit period is the period of time over which we calculate the potential income credit the income base evaluation period is the period of time over which we will consider anniversary values and if greater the income base plus income credit during the income credit period the income credit period and the income base evaluation period begin on the effective date and end  years later on the expiration of the income base evaluation period you may contact us to extend the income base evaluation period please see can i extend the income base evaluation period beyond  years below however you cannot extend the income credit period third we determine the anniversary value which equals your contract value on any contract anniversary during the income base evaluation period minus any ineligible purchase payments fourth we determine the income base which initially is equal to the first eligible purchase payment please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock for life plus below if the feature is elected after contract issue the initial income base is the contract value on the effective date on each contract anniversary we determine if the income base should be increased based on the maximum anniversary value or any available income credit the calculation and components of this determination are detailed below calculation of the income base when income credit is not available or after income credit period ends on each contract anniversary occurring during the income base evaluation period the income base is automatically increased to the anniversary value when the anniversary value is greater than both a and b where a is the current income base and b is all previous maximum anniversary values during the income base evaluation period calculation of the income base when income credit is available the income credit base is used to calculate the income credit during the income credit period the income credit is calculated as a percentage of the income credit base the income credit base is used solely to calculate the income credit the initial income credit base is equal to the initial eligible purchase payment on each contract anniversary during the income credit period we determine the amount by which the income credit base andor the income base could increase the components used to determine this amount are a the income base calculated based on the maximum anniversary value and b the current income base plus the income credit if a is greater than or equal to b the income credit base and the income base are increased to the current anniversary value if b is greater than a the income base is increased by the income credit and the income credit base remains unchanged if the  option is elected and no withdrawals have been taken since the effective date on the th contract anniversary the income base is calculated as the greatest of a b or c where a is the income base calculated based on the maximum anniversary value b is the income credit plus the current income base and c is  of the purchase payments made in the first contract year the income credit base is increased each time subsequent eligible purchase payments are made the income credit base also increases when the income base is increased as a result of a maximum anniversary value being achieved that is greater than both the current income base and all previous maximum anniversary values the income credit base is decreased each time an excess withdrawal is taken in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the excess withdrawal the income credit base is not used in the calculation of the contract value or any other benefits under the contract the income base and income credit base are increased each time subsequent eligible purchase payments are made and adjusted each time an excess withdrawal is taken other than adjustments made for excess withdrawals the income base and income credit base can only be adjusted upwards and subsequent lower  anniversary values during the income base evaluation period will not result in a lower income base or lower income credit base finally we determine the maximum annual withdrawal amount which represents the maximum amount that may be withdrawn each contract year the maximum annual withdrawal amount is calculated by multiplying the current income base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage shown in the tables above if the income base is increased on a contract anniversary the maximum annual withdrawal amount is recalculated on that contract anniversary by multiplying the increased income base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage if the income base is increased for any eligible purchase payments the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated upon receipt of each eligible purchase payments by multiplying the new income base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage the maximum annual withdrawal amount may also be decreased due to excess withdrawals please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock for life plus below what is the fee for marketlock for life plus the fee for marketlock for life plus depends on whether you elect the  option or  option and whether you elect to cover one life or two lives  marketlock for life plus option number of covered persons annualized fee   option for one covered person  of income base  for two covered persons  of income base   option for one covered person  of income base  for two covered persons  of income base  the fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your contract value allocated to the variable portfolios starting on the first quarter following the effective date and ending upon termination of the benefit if you elect the  option and you take a withdrawal in the first  contract years following the effective date your income base is not eligible to be increased to  of the purchase payments made in the first contract year however the fee remains the same an increase in the income base due to an adjustment to a higher anniversary value addition of an income credit or subsequent eligible purchase payments will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee the fee of the feature may change at the time of extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature if your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been terminated the fee will no longer be deducted we will not assess the quarterly fee if you annuitize your contract before the end of a contract quarter if the feature is still in effect and you surrender your contract we will assess a prorata charge for the fee if you surrender your contract before the end of a contract quarter the prorata charge is calculated by multiplying the full quarterly fee by the number of days between the date the fee was last assessed and the date of surrender divided by the number of days in a contract quarter what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock for life plus the maximum annual withdrawal amount the income base and income credit base may change over time as a result of the timing and amount of withdrawals if you elect the  option and you take a withdrawal in the first  contract years following the effective date your income base is not eligible to be increased to  of the purchase payments made in the first contract year any withdrawals in a contract year that in total are less than or equal to the maximum annual withdrawal amount do not reduce the income base or income credit base withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount are considered excess withdrawals we define excess withdrawals as any portion of a withdrawal that causes the total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount including but not limited to any withdrawal in a contract year taken after the maximum annual withdrawal amount has been withdrawn  you should not elect this feature if you plan to take excess withdrawals since those withdrawals may significantly reduce or eliminate the value of the feature in addition if you plan to take withdrawals in any year during the income credit period an income credit will not be added to your income base on that contract anniversary you may take withdrawals during a contract year up to or less than the maximum annual withdrawal amount however if you choose to take less than the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any contract year you may not carry over the unused amount into subsequent years your maximum annual withdrawal amount will not be recalculated as a result of taking less than the entire maximum annual withdrawal amount in any given year the impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of marketlock for life plus are further explained below income base and income credit base if the sum of withdrawals in any benefit year exceeds the maximum annual withdrawal amount the income base and income credit base will be reduced for those withdrawals for each excess withdrawal taken the income base and income credit base are reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by each excess withdrawal since excess withdrawals reduce the income credit base it will result in the reduction of the amount of the income credit available in subsequent benefit years maximum annual withdrawal amount the maximum annual withdrawal amount is recalculated each time there is a change in the income base accordingly if the sum of withdrawals in any contract year does not exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that year the maximum annual withdrawal amount will not change for the next year unless your income base is increased as described above under how are the components for marketlock for life plus calculated if you take an excess withdrawal the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated by multiplying the reduced income base by the existing maximum annual withdrawal percentage this recalculated maximum annual withdrawal amount will be available beginning on the next contract anniversary and may be lower than your previous maximum annual withdrawal amount the optional living benefits examples appendix provides examples of the effects of withdrawals what happens if the contract value is reduced to zero if the contract value is reduced to zero but the income base is greater than zero guaranteed withdrawals will continue to be payable over the lifetime of the covered persons however if at any time an excess withdrawal reduces your contract value to zero no benefits will remain under this feature the income base evaluation period and the income credit period end and the income credit base equals zero if the contract value is reduced to zero the contracts other benefits will be terminated you may no longer make subsequent purchase payments or transfers and no death benefit or future annuity income payments are available therefore you should be aware that particularly during times of unfavorable investment performance withdrawals taken under the benefit may reduce the contract value to zero and eliminate any other benefits of the contract when the contract value equals zero but a benefit remains payable to receive any remaining benefit you must select one of the following options for payment  the current maximum annual withdrawal amount divided equally and paid on a quarterly semiannual or annual frequency as selected by you until the date of death of the covered persons or  any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us if you do not select a payment option above the remaining benefit will be paid as the current maximum annual withdrawal amount divided equally and paid on a quarterly basis until the date of death of the covered persons any amounts that we may pay under the feature in excess of your contract value are subject to the companys financial strength and claimspaying ability  can i extend the income base evaluation period beyond  years there is an option for extension of the income base evaluation period as long as you have not elected to cancel the feature and the age of the covered person or younger of two covered persons is  or younger at the time of extension if you elect to extend the income base evaluation period the income base can continue to be adjusted upward as described above on each anniversary during the new income base evaluation period which is a period of  years prior to the end of the initial income base evaluation period and prior to the end of each evaluation period you elect to extend we will notify you of the terms of the next extension in writing we will provide you with an extension election form prior to the end of each evaluation period you extend if you elect to extend the evaluation period you must complete the election form and return it to us or advise us as to your intent to extend in a method acceptable to us the fee and investment requirements of the feature may change at the time of extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature if you do not contact us at the end of each income base evaluation period to extend the income base evaluation period an extension will no longer be available and the income base will not be adjusted for higher anniversary values on subsequent contract anniversaries however you can continue to take the maximum annual withdrawal amount in effect at the end of the last income base evaluation period subject to adjustments for excess withdrawals you will continue to pay the fee at the rate that was in effect during the last income base evaluation period and you will not be permitted to extend the income base evaluation period in the future can i extend the income credit period beyond  years no the income credit period may not be extended however the income base evaluation period as described above may be extended what happens to marketlock for life plus upon a spousal continuation if there is one covered person and that person dies the surviving spousal joint owner or spousal beneficiary may elect to  make a death claim if the contract value is greater than zero which terminates marketlock for life plus and the contract or  continue the contract if the contract value is greater than zero without marketlock for life plus and its corresponding fee if there are two covered persons upon the death of one covered person the surviving covered person may elect to  make a death claim if the contract value is greater than zero which terminates marketlock for life plus and the contract or

older owner marketlock cannot be elected if you elect any other optional living benefit  how does marketlock work marketlock automatically locks in the highest contract anniversary value during the first  years or  years if you extend the maximum anniversary value mav evaluation period as discussed below and guarantees annual withdrawals based on this amount over the period that the benefit is in effect additionally you may take withdrawals over the lifetime of the owner as more fully described below for jointly owned contracts the older owner is the life upon which the lifetime guarantee applies accordingly if the older contract owner were to die first the surviving younger spousal owner is not eligible for lifetime withdrawals but may elect to continue the contract and receive any remaining withdrawals under the feature as described below marketlock is designed for individuals or spousal joint owners thus if a contract is owned by nonspousal joint owners and either owner dies the full contract value must be paid within  years of death after which time the contract terminates the surviving owner may not receive the benefit of marketlock the benefits components and value may vary depending on when the first withdrawal is taken the age of the older owner at the time of the first withdrawal and the amount that is withdrawn your withdrawal activity determines the time period over which you are eligible to receive withdrawals you will automatically be eligible to receive lifetime withdrawals if you begin withdrawals on or after your th birthday and your withdrawals do not

remaining mav benefit base which will be less than your maximum annual withdrawal amount may be taken at any time during the final year of the minimum withdrawal period  lifetime withdrawals are available so long as your first withdrawal is taken on or after age  and withdrawals do not exceed the  maximum annual withdrawal percentage indicated above if withdrawals exceed the  maximum annual withdrawal percentage in any benefit year other than for rmd amounts for this contract that are greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount lifetime withdrawals are no longer available instead

withdrawal and reduced for withdrawals already taken if you are taking required minimum distributions rmd from the contract and the portion of the rmd amount based on this contract only is greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount in a benefit year that portion of the withdrawal will not be treated as an excess withdrawal any portion of an rmd withdrawal in a benefit year that is greater than both the maximum annual withdrawal amount and the  rmd amount based only on this contract will be considered an excess withdrawal this will result in cancellation of the lifetime withdrawals and may further reduce your maximum annual withdrawal amount mav benefit base and remaining minimum withdrawal period please see how are the components for marketlock calculated below for details on the effects of withdrawals please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock how are the components for marketlock calculated in order to determine the benefits value we calculate each of the components as described below first we determine the eligible purchase payments which include the amount of purchase payments received during the first two years after your contract issue date adjusted for any withdrawals during that period any purchase payments we receive more than two years after your contract issue date are considered ineligible purchase payments the calculation of eligible purchase payments does not include any spousal continuation contributions however spousal continuation contributions are included in the calculation of anniversary values as defined below please see spousal continuation below eligible purchase payments are limited to  without prior company approval second we consider the mav evaluation period which begins on your contract issue date and ends on your th contract anniversary on the expiration of the mav evaluation period you may contact us to extend the mav evaluation period for an additional period as discussed further below third we determine the anniversary value which equals the value of your contract on any contract anniversary during the mav evaluation period minus any ineligible purchase payments fourth we determine the mav benefit base initially the mav benefit base equals the first eligible purchase payment thereafter the mav benefit base is increased each time subsequent eligible purchase payments are made and adjusted each time any withdrawals of contract value are taken please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock below on each contract anniversary throughout the mav evaluation period the mav benefit base automatically adjusts upwards if the current anniversary value is greater than both the current mav benefit base and any previous years anniversary value other than adjustments made for withdrawals the mav benefit base will only be adjusted upwards and subsequent lower anniversary values through the mav evaluation period will not result in a lower mav benefit base fifth we determine the maximum annual withdrawal amount which represents the maximum amount that may be withdrawn each benefit year and is an amount calculated as a percentage of the mav benefit base the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage is determined based on the benefit year when you take your first withdrawal or whether you are taking lifetime withdrawals applicable percentages are shown in the marketlock summary table above if the mav benefit base is increased to the current anniversary value the maximum annual withdrawal amount is recalculated on that contract anniversary using the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the new mav benefit base if the mav benefit base is increased for eligible purchase payments the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated by multiplying the new mav benefit base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage finally we determine the minimum withdrawal period which is the minimum period over which you may take withdrawals under the feature the initial minimum withdrawal period is calculated when withdrawals under the benefit begin and is recalculated when the mav benefit base is adjusted to a higher anniversary value by dividing the mav benefit base by the maximum annual withdrawal amount please see the marketlock summary table above for initial minimum withdrawal periods the minimum withdrawal periods will be reduced due to withdrawals for details on the effects of withdrawals please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock below can i extend the mav evaluation period beyond  years yes as long as you have not elected to cancel the feature and the older owner is age  or younger at the time you elect the extension you may elect to extend the mav evaluation period we guarantee that you will be given the opportunity to extend the mav evaluation period under these conditions for at least one additional evaluation period of  years in order to extend the mav evaluation period you must contact us no later than the end of  the mav evaluation period if you elect to extend the mav evaluation period the mav benefit base can continue to be adjusted upward as described above on each anniversary during the new mav evaluation period please see how are the components of marketlock calculated prior to the end of the initial mav evaluation period we will inform you of the terms of the next extension in writing we will provide you with an extension election form prior to the end of the initial mav evaluation period if you elect to extend the mav evaluation period you must complete the election form and return it to us or advise us as to your intent to extend in a method acceptable to us additional mav evaluation periods may be offered at our sole discretion the fee for the feature may change at the time of extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature if you do not contact us to extend the mav evaluation period the mav benefit base will no longer be adjusted on subsequent contract anniversaries however you can continue to take the maximum annual withdrawal amount in effect at the end of the last mav evaluation period subject to adjustments for withdrawals you will continue to pay the fee at the rate that was in effect during the last mav evaluation period and you will not be permitted to extend the mav evaluation period in the future what is the fee for marketlock the annualized fee for marketlock is calculated as  of the mav benefit base for all years in which the feature is in effect however if you elect to extend the mav evaluation period the fee may change at the time of the extension the fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your contract value allocated to the variable portfolios starting on the first quarter following your contract issue date and ending upon termination of the benefit we will not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize your contract before the end of a contract quarter you should keep in mind that an increase in the mav benefit base due to an adjustment to a higher anniversary value or due to subsequent eligible purchase payments will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee alternatively a decrease in mav benefit base due to withdrawals will decrease the dollar amount of the fee if your mav benefit base falls to zero before the feature has been terminated the fee will no longer be deducted however if the mav benefit base is adjusted upwards at a later date because the current anniversary value is greater than both the current and any previous anniversary values the calculation and deduction of the fee will resume what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock the maximum annual withdrawal amount mav benefit base and minimum withdrawal period may change over time as a result of the timing and amounts of withdrawals if you elect to begin withdrawals prior to your th birthday if jointly owned prior to the th birthday of the older owner you will not be eligible to receive lifetime withdrawals if you begin withdrawals on or after your th birthday older owners th birthday if jointly owned and wish to receive lifetime withdrawals you must withdraw no more than the maximum annual withdrawal amount which is calculated as  of the mav benefit base if the amount of withdrawals at any time exceeds  of the mav benefit base in a benefit year you will not receive lifetime withdrawals however you can continue to receive withdrawals over the minimum withdrawal period in amounts up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount as described in the marketlock summary table and under how are the components for marketlock calculated above based on when you made your first withdrawal and adjusted for withdrawals already taken total withdrawals in any benefit year equal to or less than the maximum annual withdrawal amount reduce the mav benefit base by the amount of the withdrawal withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount are considered excess withdrawals we define excess withdrawals as either  any portion of a withdrawal that causes the total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount or  any withdrawal in a benefit year taken after the maximum annual withdrawal amount has been withdrawn excess withdrawals will reduce the mav benefit base by the greater of a the amount of the excess withdrawal or b the relative size of the excess withdrawal in relation to the contract value prior to the excess  withdrawal this means that if contract value is less than the mav benefit base withdrawals greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount will result in a proportionately greater reduction of the mav benefit base as described below which will be more than the amount of the withdrawal itself this will also reduce your maximum annual withdrawal amount the impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of marketlock are further explained below mav benefit base withdrawals reduce the mav benefit base as follows  if the withdrawal does not cause total withdrawals in the benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the mav benefit base will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal  excess withdrawals as described above reduce the mav benefit base as follows if total withdrawals during the benefit year including the current withdrawal exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the mav benefit base is reduced to the lesser of a or b where a is the mav benefit base immediately prior to the withdrawal minus the amount of the excess withdrawal or b is the mav benefit base immediately prior to the withdrawal reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the amount of the excess withdrawal maximum annual withdrawal amount if the sum of withdrawals in a benefit year does not exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that benefit year the maximum annual withdrawal amount will not change for the next benefit year unless your mav benefit base is adjusted upward as described above under how are the components for marketlock calculated if total withdrawals in a benefit year exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated on the next contract anniversary the new maximum annual withdrawal amount will equal the new mav benefit base after any withdrawals on that contract anniversary divided by the new minimum withdrawal period on that contract anniversary on that contract anniversary the new maximum annual withdrawal amount may be lower than your previous maximum annual withdrawal amount minimum withdrawal period on each contract anniversary a new minimum withdrawal period is calculated as shown in the chart below  the amount withdrawn in a benefit year effect on minimum withdrawal period  amounts up to the maximum annual withdrawal new minimum withdrawal period  the mav benefit base which amount includes a deduction for any previous withdrawal divided by the current maximum annual withdrawal amount  amounts in excess of the maximum annual new minimum withdrawal period  the minimum withdrawal withdrawal amount period as of the prior contract anniversary minus one year  the optional living benefits examples appendix

payable under the feature until the mav benefit base is zero further if you are eligible to take lifetime withdrawals a benefit is still payable even if the contract value and mav benefit base both equal zero however the contracts other benefits will be terminated once the contract value equals zero you may not make subsequent purchase payments or transfers and no death benefit or future

as of the benefit date how and when can i elect seasons promise you may only elect this feature at the time your contract is issued you cannot elect the feature if you are age  or older on the

or terminated prior to the benefit date the feature terminates automatically following the benefit date in addition the feature will no longer be available and no benefit will be paid if a death benefit is paid or if the contract is fully surrendered or annuitized before the end benefit date how is the benefit calculated for seasons promise the benefit is a onetime adjustment to your contract in the event that your contract value on the benefit date is less than the purchase payments made in the contracts first  days the benefit is equal to your benefit base as defined below minus your contract value on the benefit date if the resulting amount is positive you will receive a benefit under the feature if the resulting amount is negative you will not receive a benefit your benefit base is equal to a minus b where a is the purchase payments received on or after the contract issue date in the contracts first  days and b is an adjustment for all withdrawals and applicable fees and charges made subsequent to the contract issue date in an amount proportionate to the amount by which the withdrawal decreased the contract value at the time of the withdrawal what is the fee for seasons promise the annualized fee is calculated as a percentage of contract value minus purchase payments received after the th day since the contract issue date the fee will be deducted from the portion of your contract value allocated to the variable portfolios each quarter throughout the first  full contract years beginning at the end of the first contract quarter following the contract issue date and up to and including on the benefit date once the feature is terminated as discussed above the charge will no longer be deducted we will also not assess the quarterly fee if you

contract issue date what happens to seasons promise upon a spousal continuation if your spouse chooses to continue this contract upon your death this feature cannot be terminated the benefit date will not change as a result of a spousal continuation please see spousal continuation below important information about seasons promise seasons promise only guarantees purchase payments made in the first  days after issue if you plan to add subsequent purchase payments after the first  days you should know that seasons promise would not protect those purchase payments since seasons promise may not guarantee a return of all purchase payments it is important to realize that subsequent purchase payments made into the contract may decrease the value of the benefit for example if near the benefit date your benefit base is greater than your contract value and you then make a subsequent purchase payment that causes your contract value to be larger than your benefit base on your benefit date you will not  receive any benefit even though you have paid for seasons promise throughout the first  full contract years you should discuss making subsequent purchase payments with your financial representative as such activity may reduce or eliminate the value of the benefit we will allocate the benefit if any on the benefit date to the cash management variable portfolio any benefit paid is not considered a purchase payment for purposes of calculating other benefits or features of your contract other contract benefits based on earnings will continue to define earnings as the difference between contract value and purchase payments adjusted for withdrawals for information about how the benefit is treated for income tax purposes you should consult a qualified tax advisor for information concerning your particular circumstances we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate seasons promise at any time for prospectively issued contracts death benefits if you die during

of our receipt of all required paperwork and satisfactory proof of death we pay a lump sum death benefit to the beneficiary the death benefit must be paid within  years of the date of death unless the beneficiary elects to have it payable in the form of an annuity income option if the beneficiary elects an annuity income option it must be paid over the beneficiarys lifetime or for a period not extending beyond the beneficiarys life expectancy payments must begin within one year of your death if the beneficiary is the spouse of a deceased owner he or she can elect to continue the contract at

life expectancy under the extended legacy program if available described below subject to the applicable internal revenue code distribution requirements payments must begin no later than the first anniversary of death for nonqualified contracts or december st of the year following the year of death for  iras your beneficiary cannot participate in the extended legacy program if heshe has already elected another settlement option beneficiaries who do not begin taking payments within these specified time periods will not be eligible to elect an annuity income option or participate in the extended legacy program extended legacy program and beneficiary continuation options the extended legacy program if available can allow a beneficiary to take the death benefit amount in the form of annuity income payments over a longer period of time with the flexibility to withdraw more than the irs required minimum distribution the contract continues in the original owners name for the benefit of the beneficiary the extended legacy program allows the beneficiary to take withdrawals in the form of a series of payments similar to the required minimum distributions under an ira generally irs required minimum distributions must be made at least annually over a period not to exceed the beneficiarys life expectancy as determined in the calendar year after the owners death a beneficiary may withdraw all or a portion of the contract value at any time name their own beneficiary to receive any remaining unpaid amount in the contract in the event of their death and make transfers among

anniversary of death for nonqualified contracts or by december st of the year containing the fifth anniversary of death for iras for iras the year payout option is not available if the date of death is after the required beginning date for distributions april  of the year following the year the original owner reaches the age of   please consult a qualified advisor regarding tax implications of these options and your particular circumstances death benefit defined terms the term net purchase payment is used frequently in describing the death benefit payable net purchase payment is an ongoing calculation it does not represent a contract value we define net purchase payments as purchase payments less an adjustment for each withdrawal including fees and charges applicable to that withdrawal if you have not taken any withdrawals from your contract net purchase payments equal total purchase payments into your contract to calculate the adjustment amount for the first withdrawal made under the contract we determine the percentage by which the withdrawal reduced the contract value for example a  withdrawal from a  contract is a  reduction in value this percentage is calculated by dividing the amount of each withdrawal by the contract value immediately before taking the withdrawal the resulting percentage is then multiplied by the amount of the total purchase payments and subtracted from the amount of the total purchase payments on deposit at the time of the withdrawal the resulting amount is the initial net purchase payment to arrive at the net purchase payment calculation for subsequent withdrawals we determine the percentage by which the contract value is reduced by taking the amount of the withdrawal in relation to the contract value immediately before the withdrawal we then multiply the net purchase payment calculation as determined prior to the withdrawal by this percentage we subtract that result from the net purchase payment calculation as determined prior to the withdrawal to arrive at all subsequent net purchase payment calculations the term withdrawals as used in describing the death benefit options is defined as withdrawals and the fees and charges applicable to those withdrawals the company does not accept purchase payments from anyone age  or older therefore the death benefit calculations assume that no purchase payments are received on or after your th birthday  death benefit options this contract provides two death benefit options the standard death benefit which is automatically included in your contract for no additional fee and an optional enhanced death benefit which you may elect for an additional fee standard death benefit if the contract is issued prior to your rd birthday the standard death benefit on your contract is the greater of  contract value or  net purchase payments if the contract is issued on or after your rd birthday but prior to your th birthday the standard death benefit is the greater of  contract value or  the lesser of a net purchase payments or b  of contract value optional maximum anniversary value option you may elect the maximum anniversary value option described below which can provide greater protection for your beneficiaries you must elect the maximum anniversary value option at the time you purchase your contract and once elected it cannot be terminated by you the annualized fee for the maximum anniversary value option is  of the average daily net asset value allocated to the variable portfolios the death benefit is the greatest of  contract value or  net purchase payments or  maximum anniversary value on any contract anniversary prior to your rd birthday the anniversary values equal the contract value on a contract anniversary reduced for withdrawals since that contract anniversary in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date of such withdrawal and adjusted for any purchase payments since that anniversary the maximum anniversary value option can only be elected prior to your rd birthday for contracts in which the aggregate of all purchase payments in contracts issued by aig sunamerica life andor first sunamerica life to the same ownerannuitant are in excess of  we reserve the right to limit the death benefit amount that is in excess of contract value at the time we receive all paperwork and satisfactory proof of death any limit on the maximum death benefit payable would be mutually agreed upon in writing by you and the company prior to purchasing the contract spousal continuation the continuing spouse may elect to continue the contract after your death generally the contract its benefits and elected features if any remain the same the continuing spouse is subject to the same fees charges and expenses applicable to the original owner of the contract a spousal continuation can only take place once upon the death of the original owner of the contract if the continuing spouse terminates any optional death benefit or dies after the latest annuity date no optional death benefit will be payable to the continuing spouses beneficiary to the extent that the continuing spouse invests in the variable portfolios they will be subject to investment risk as was the original owner  upon a spousal continuation we will contribute to the contract value an amount by which the death benefit that would have been paid to the beneficiary upon the death of the original owner exceeds the contract value continuation contribution if any we calculate the continuation contribution as of the date of the original owners death we will add the continuation contribution as of the date we receive both the continuing spouses written request to continue the contract and satisfactory proof of death of the original owner continuation date at the annuity service center the continuation contribution is not considered a purchase payment for the purposes of any other calculations except the death benefit following the continuing spouses death generally the age of the continuing spouse on the continuation date and on the date of the continuing spouses death will be used in determining any future death benefits under the contract please see the spousal continuation appendix for a discussion of the death benefit calculations after a spousal continuation we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate the spousal continuation provision in its entirety or any component at any time for prospectively issued contracts please see optional living benefits and death benefits above for information on the

account expenses the annualized separate account expense is  of the average daily ending net asset value allocated to the variable portfolios this charge compensates the company for the mortality and expense risk and the costs of contract distribution assumed by the company generally the mortality risks assumed by the company arise from its contractual obligations to make annuity income payments after the annuity date and to provide a death benefit the expense risk assumed by the company is that the costs of administering the contracts and the separate account will exceed the amount received from the fees and charges assessed under the contract if these charges do not cover all of our expenses we will pay the difference likewise if these charges exceed our expenses we will keep the

tax treatment of annuity contracts generally taxes on the earnings in your annuity contract are deferred until you take the money out qualified retirement investments that satisfy specific tax and erisa requirements automatically provide tax deferral regardless of whether the underlying contract is an annuity a trust or a custodial account different rules apply depending on how you take the money out and whether your contract is qualified or nonqualified if you do not purchase your contract under a pension plan a specially sponsored employer program or an individual retirement account ira your contract is referred to as a nonqualified contract a nonqualified contract receives different tax treatment than a qualified contract in general your cost in a nonqualified contract is equal to the purchase payments you put into the contract you have already been taxed on the cost basis in your contract if you purchase your contract under a pension plan a specially sponsored employer program as an individual retirement annuity or under an ira your contract is referred to as a qualified contract examples of qualified plans or arrangements are individual retirement annuities and iras roth iras taxsheltered annuities also referred to as b annuities or b contracts plans of selfemployed individuals often referred to as hr  plans or keogh plans pension and profit sharing plans including k plans and governmental b plans typically for employer plans and taxdeductible ira contributions you have not paid any tax on the purchase payments used to buy your contract and therefore you have no cost basis in your contract however you normally will have a cost basis in a roth ira a roth b or a roth k account and you may have cost basis in a traditional ira or in another qualified contract aggregation of contracts all nonqualified contracts that are issued by us or our affiliates to you during any calendar year will be treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the taxable amount of any distribution tax treatment of distributions  nonqualified contracts if you make partial or total withdrawals from a nonqualified contract the irc generally treats such withdrawals as coming first from taxable earnings and then coming from your purchase payments purchase payments made prior to august   however are an important exception to this general rule and for tax purposes generally are treated as being distributed first before either the earnings on those contributions or other purchase payments and earnings in the contract if you annuitize your contract a portion of each annuity income payment will be considered for tax purposes to be a return of a portion of your purchase payment generally until you have received all of your purchase payment any portion of each annuity income payment that is considered a return of your purchase payment will not be taxed additionally the taxable portion of any withdrawals whether annuitized or other withdrawals generally is subject to applicable state andor local income taxes and may be subject to an additional  penalty tax unless withdrawn in conjunction with the following circumstances  after attaining age    when paid to your beneficiary after you die  after you become disabled as defined in the irc  when paid as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or joint expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary for a period of  years or attainment of age   whichever is later   under an immediate annuity contract  which are attributable to purchase payments made prior to august   tax treatment of distributions  qualified contracts including governmental b eligible deferred compensation plans generally you have not paid any taxes on the purchase payments used to buy a qualified contract as a result most amounts withdrawn from the contract or received as annuity income payments will be taxable income exceptions to this general rule include withdrawals attributable to aftertax roth ira roth b and roth k contributions withdrawals from roth iras are generally treated for federal tax purposes as coming first from the roth contributions that have already been taxed and as entirely tax free withdrawals from roth b and roth k accounts and withdrawals generally from qualified contracts are treated generally as coming prorata from amounts that already have been taxed and amounts that are taxed upon withdrawal withdrawals from roth ira roth b and roth k accounts which satisfy certain qualification requirements including at least five years in a roth account under the plan or ira and either attainment of age   death or disability or if an ira for the purchase of a first home will not be subject to federal income taxation the taxable portion of any withdrawal or income payment from a qualified contract will be subject to an additional  penalty tax under the irc except in the following circumstances  after attainment of age    when paid to your beneficiary after you die  after you become disabled as defined in the irc  as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or joint expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary for a period of  years or attainment of age   whichever is later  payments to employees after separation from service after attainment of age  does not apply to iras  dividends paid with respect to stock of a corporation described in irc section k  for payment of medical expenses to the extent such withdrawals do not exceed limitations set by the irc for deductible amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care  payments to alternate payees pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order does not apply to iras  for payment of health insurance if you are unemployed and meet certain requirements  distributions from iras for higher education expenses  distributions from iras for first home purchases  amounts distributed from a code section b plan other than to the extent such amounts in a governmental code section b plan represent rollovers from an ira or employersponsored plan to which the  penalty would otherwise apply and which are treated as distributed from a qualified plan for purposes of the premature distribution penalty the irc limits the withdrawal of an employees voluntary purchase payments from a taxsheltered annuity tsa withdrawals can only be made when an owner  reaches age    severs employment with the employer  dies  becomes disabled as defined in the irc or  experiences a financial hardship as defined in the irc in the case of hardship the owner can only withdraw purchase payments additional plan limitations may also apply amounts held in a tsa annuity contract as of december   are not subject to these restrictions qualifying transfers of amounts from one tsa contract to another tsa contract under section b or to a custodial account under section b and qualifying transfers to a state defined benefit plan to purchase service credits are not considered distributions and thus are not subject to these withdrawal limitations if amounts are transferred from a custodial account described in code section b to this contract the transferred amount will retain the custodial account withdrawal restrictions  transfer among b annuities andor b custodial accounts generally are subject to rules set out in the code regulations irs pronouncements and other applicable legal authorities on july   the department of the treasury published final b regulations that are largely effective on january   these comprehensive regulations include several new rules and requirements such as a requirement that employers maintain their b plans pursuant to a written plan the final regulations subsequent irs guidance and the terms of the written plan may impose new restrictions on both new and existing contracts including restrictions on the availability of loans distributions transfers and exchanges regardless of when a contract was purchased prior to the effective date of the final regulations provisions applicable to taxfree transfers and exchanges of b annuity contracts or custodial accounts became effective september   replacing existing rules under irs revenue ruling   transfer under these new rules transfers and exchanges both referred to below as transfers are available only to the extent permitted under the employers b plan once established additionally transfers occurring after september   that do not comply with these new rules can become taxable on january   or the date of the transfer whichever is later if you make a transfer to a contract or custodial account that is not part of the employers b plan other than a transfer to a different plan and the provider and employer fail to enter into an information sharing agreement by january   the transfer would be considered a failed transfer that is subject to tax additional guidance issued by the irs generally permits a failed transfer to be corrected no later than june   by retransferring to a contract or custodial account that is part of the employers b plan or that is subject to an informationsharing agreement with the employer in general certain contracts originally established by a  transfer prior to september   are exempt or grandfathered from some of the requirements of the final regulations provided that no salary reduction or other contributions have ever been made to the contract and that no additional transfers are made to the contract on or after september   further contracts that are not grandfathered are generally required to be part of and subject to the requirements of an employers b plan upon its establishment but no later than by january   the new rules in the final regulations generally do not affect a participants ability to transfer some or all of a b account to a statedefined benefit plan to purchase service credits where such a transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable rules and requirements and with the terms of the employers plan you may wish to discuss the new regulations andor the general information above with your tax advisor withdrawals from other qualified contracts are often limited by the irc and by the employers plan if you are purchasing the contract as an investment vehicle for a trust under a qualified plan you should consider that the contract does not provide any additional taxdeferral benefits beyond the treatment provided by the trust itself in addition if the contract itself is a qualifying arrangement as with a b annuity or individual retirement annuity the contract generally does not provide tax deferral benefits beyond the treatment provided to alternative qualifying arrangements such as trusts or custodial accounts however in both cases the contract offers features and benefits that other investments may not offer you and your financial representative should carefully consider whether the features and benefits including the investment options lifetime annuity income options and protection through living benefits death benefits and other benefits provided under an annuity contract issued in connection with a qualified contract are suitable for your needs and objectives and are appropriate in light of the expense required minimum distributions generally the irc requires that you begin taking annual distributions from qualified annuity contracts by april  of the calendar year following the later of  the calendar year in which you attain age   or  the calendar year in which you separate from service from the employer sponsoring the plan if you own a traditional ira you must begin receiving minimum distributions for the year in which you reach age   you can delay taking your first distribution until the following year however you must take your distribution on or before april  of that same following year it is important to note that if you choose to delay your first distribution you will be required to withdraw your second required minimum distribution on or before december  in that same year for each year thereafter you must withdraw your required minimum distribution by december   if you own more than one tsa you may be permitted to take your annual distributions in any combination from your tsas a similar rule applies if you own more than one ira however you cannot satisfy this distribution requirement for your tsa contract by taking a distribution from an ira and you cannot satisfy the requirement for your ira by taking a distribution from a tsa you may be subject to a surrender charge on withdrawals taken to meet minimum distribution requirements if the withdrawals exceed the contracts maximum penalty free amount failure to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements may result in a tax penalty you should consult your tax advisor for more information you may elect to have the required minimum distribution amount on your contract calculated and withdrawn each year under the automatic withdrawal option you may select monthly quarterly semiannual or annual withdrawals for this purpose this service is provided as a courtesy and we do not guarantee the accuracy of our calculations accordingly we recommend you consult your tax advisor concerning your required minimum distribution you may terminate your election for automated minimum distribution at any time by sending a written request to our annuity service center we reserve the right to change or discontinue this service at any time the irs issued regulations effective january   regarding required minimum distributions from qualified annuity contracts one of the regulations effective january   will require that the annuity contract value used to determine required minimum distributions include the actuarial value of other benefits under the contract such as optional death benefits and living benefits this regulation does not apply to required minimum distributions made under an irrevocable annuity income option you should discuss the effect of these new regulations with your tax advisor tax treatment of death benefits any death benefits paid under the contract are taxable to the beneficiary the rules governing the taxation of payments from an annuity contract as discussed above generally apply whether the death benefits are paid as lump sum or as annuity income payments estate taxes may also apply certain enhanced death benefits may be purchased under your contract although these types of benefits are used as investment protection and should not give rise to any adverse tax effects the irs could take the position that some or all of the charges for these death benefits should be treated as a partial withdrawal from the contract in that case the amount of the partial withdrawal may be includible in taxable income and subject to the  penalty if the owner is under   if you own a qualified contract and purchase these enhanced death benefits the irs may consider these benefits incidental death benefits or life insurance the irc imposes limits on the amount of the incidental benefits andor life insurance allowable for qualified contracts and the employersponsored plans under which they are purchased if the death benefits selected by you are considered to exceed these limits the benefits could result in taxable income to the owner of the qualified contract and in some cases could adversely impact the qualified status of the qualified contract or the plan you should consult your tax advisor regarding these features and benefits prior to purchasing a contract tax treatment of optional living benefits generally we will treat amounts credited to the contract value under the optional living benefit guarantees for income tax purposes as earnings in the contract payments in accordance with such guarantees after the contract value has been reduced to zero may be treated for tax purposes as amounts received as an annuity if the other requirements for such treatment are satisfied all payments or withdrawals after cost basis has been reduced to zero whether or not under such a guarantee will be treated as taxable amounts if available and you elect an optional living benefit the application of certain tax rules including those rules relating to distributions from your contract are not entirely clear such benefits are not intended to adversely affect the tax treatment of distributions or of the contract however you should be aware that little such guidance is available you should consult a tax advisor before electing an optional living benefit  contracts owned by a trust or corporation a trust or corporation nonnatural owner that is considering purchasing this contract should consult a tax advisor generally the irc does not treat a nonqualified contract owned by a nonnatural owner as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes the nonnatural owner pays tax currently on the contracts value in excess of the owners cost basis however this treatment is not applied to a contract held by a trust or other entity as an agent for a natural person nor to contracts held by qualified plans please see the statement of additional information for a more detailed discussion of the potential adverse tax consequences associated with nonnatural ownership of a nonqualified annuity contract gifts pledges andor assignments of a contract if you transfer ownership of your nonqualified contract to a person other than your spouse or former spouse incident to divorce as a gift you will pay federal income tax on the contracts cash value to the extent it exceeds your cost basis the recipients cost basis will be increased by the amount on which you will pay federal taxes in addition the irc treats any assignment or pledge or agreement to assign or pledge of any portion of a nonqualified contract as a withdrawal please see the statement of additional information for a more detailed discussion regarding potential tax consequences of gifting assigning or pledging a nonqualified contract the irc prohibits qualified annuity contracts including iras from being transferred assigned or pledged as security for a loan this prohibition however generally does not apply to loans under an employersponsored plan including loans from the annuity contract that satisfy certain requirements provided that a the plan is not an unfunded deferred compensation plan and b the plan funding vehicle is not an ira diversification and investor control the irc imposes certain diversification requirements on the underlying investments for a variable annuity we believe that the manager of the underlying funds monitors the funds so as to comply with these requirements to be treated as a variable annuity for tax purposes the underlying funds must meet these requirements the diversification regulations do not provide guidance as to the circumstances under which you and not the company would be considered the owner of the shares of the variable portfolios under your nonqualified contract because of the degree of control you exercise over the underlying investments this diversification requirement is sometimes referred to as investor control the determination of whether you possess sufficient incidents of ownership over variable portfolio assets to be deemed the owner of the underlying funds depends on all of the relevant facts and circumstances however irs revenue ruling  provides that an annuity owners ability to choose among general investment strategies either at the time of the initial purchase or thereafter does not constitute control sufficient to cause the contract holder to be treated as the owner of the variable portfolios the revenue ruling provides that if based on all the facts and circumstances you do not have direct or indirect control over the separate account or any variable portfolio asset then you do not possess sufficient incidents of ownership over the assets supporting the annuity to be deemed the owner of the assets for federal income tax purposes if any guidance is provided which is considered a new position then the guidance should generally be applied prospectively however if such guidance is considered not to be a new position it may be applied retroactively this would mean that you as the owner of the nonqualified contract could be treated as the owner of the underlying fund due to the uncertainty in this area we reserve the right to modify the contract in an attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment these investor control limitations generally do not apply to qualified contracts which are referred to as pension plan contracts for purposes of this rule although the limitations could be applied to qualified contracts in

following spousal continuation the following details the death benefit options available upon the continuing spouses death the death benefit we will pay to the new beneficiary chosen by the continuing spouse varies depending on the death benefit option elected by the original owner of the contract and the age of the continuing spouse as of the continuation date and continuing spouses date of death capitalized terms used in this appendix have the same meaning as they have in the prospectus the term continuation net purchase payment is used frequently to describe the death benefit options payable to the beneficiary of a continuing spouse we define continuation net purchase payment as net purchase payments made as of the continuation date for the purposes of calculating continuation net purchase payments the amount that equals the contract value on the continuation date including the continuation contribution is considered a purchase payment if the continuing spouse makes no additional purchase payments or withdrawals continuation net purchase payments equals the contract value on the continuation date including the continuation contribution the term withdrawals as used in describing the death benefits is defined as withdrawals and the fees and charges applicable to those withdrawals the company will not accept purchase payments from anyone age  or older furthermore the death benefit calculations assume that no purchase payments are received on or after your th birthday standard death benefit payable upon continuing spouses death if the standard death benefit was selected by the original owner the death benefit is as follows upon the continuing spouses death a if the continuing spouse is age  or younger on the continuation date the death benefit is the greater of  contract value or  continuation net purchase payments b if the continuing spouse is age  on the continuation date the death benefit is the greater of  contract value or  the lesser of a continuation net purchase payments or b  of contract value if the continuing spouse is age  or older on the continuation date the standard death benefit is the contract value as of the later of the date of death of the continuing spouse or the nyse business day in which we receive all required documentation in good order at our annuity service center maximum anniversary value death benefit payable upon continuing spouses death if the maximum anniversary value death benefit was selected by the original owner the death benefit is as follows upon a continuing spousess death a if the continuing spouse is age  or younger on the continuation date the death benefit is the greatest of a contract value or b continuation net purchase payments or c maximum anniversary value on any contract anniversary occurring after the continuation date but prior to the continuing spouses rd birthday plus any purchase payments received after that anniversary but received prior to the continuing spouses th birthday and reduced for any b withdrawals and fees and charges applicable to those withdrawals recorded after the anniversary in the same proportion that the withdrawal reduced the contract value on the date of the withdrawal b if the continuing spouse is age  on the continuation date the death benefit is the standard death benefit which is equal to the greater of  contract value or  the lesser of a continuation net purchase payments or b  of contract value the fee for the maximum anniversary value death benefit will no longer be deducted as of the continuation date if the continuing spouse is age  or older on the continuation date the death benefit is the contract value as of the later of the date of death of the continuing spouse or the nyse business day in which we receive all required documentation in good order at our annuity service center therefore if the continuing spouse is age  or older on the continuation date the continuing spouses beneficiary will not receive any benefit from the maximum anniversary value death benefit we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate the spousal continuation provision in its entirety or any component at any time on prospectively issued contracts b appendix c  optional living benefits examples the following examples demonstrate the operation of the marketlock income plus marketlock for life plus and

allocated to the separate account and the amount of variable annuity income payments will vary with the values of shares of the underlying investment portfolios and are also reduced by separate account charges and fees the basic objective of a variable annuity contract is to provide variable annuity income payments which will be to some degree responsive to changes in the economic environment including inflationary forces and changes in rates of return available from various types of investments the contract is designed to seek to accomplish this objective by providing that variable annuity income payments will reflect the investment performance of the separate account with respect to amounts allocated to it both before and after the annuity date since the separate account is always fully invested in shares of the underlying investment portfolios its investment performance reflects the investment performance of those entities the values of such shares held by the separate account fluctuate and are subject to the risks of changing economic conditions as well as the risk inherent in the ability of the underlying funds managements to make necessary changes in their variable portfolios to anticipate changes in economic conditions therefore the owner bears the entire investment risk that the basic objectives of the contract may not be realized and that the adverse effects of inflation may not be lessened there can be no assurance that the aggregate amount of variable annuity income payments will equal or exceed the purchase payments made with respect to a particular account for the reasons described above or because of the premature death of an annuitant another important feature of the contract related to its basic objective is the companys promise that the dollar amount of variable annuity income payments made during the lifetime of the annuitant will not be adversely affected by the actual mortality experience of the company or the actual expenses incurred by the company in excess of expense deductions provided for in the contract although the company does not guarantee the amounts of the variable annuity income payments  general

saamco does not provide any portfolio management services for the feeder funds aig saamco provides those services for the feeder funds that are normally provided by a funds investment adviser with the

saamco has contractually agreed to waive certain feeder fund advisory fees for as long as the feeder funds invest in a master fund and  master funds commonly sell their shares only to feeder funds the master funds in which the feeder funds invest also sell their shares to separate accounts of life insurance companies to fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts issued by the companies  performance data from time to time the separate account may advertise the cash management portfolios yield and effective yield both yield figures are based on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance the yield of the cash management portfolio refers to the net income generated for a contract funded by an investment in the portfolio which invests in shares of the cash management portfolio of seasons series trust over a sevenday period which period will be stated in the advertisement this income is then annualized that is the amount of income generated by the investment during that week is assumed to be generated each week over a week period and is shown as a percentage of the investment the effective yield is calculated similarly but when annualized the income earned by an investment in the portfolio is assumed to be reinvested at the end of each seven day period the effective yield will be slightly higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment neither the yield nor the effective yield takes into consideration the effect of any capital changes that might have occurred during the seven day period nor do they reflect the impact of premium taxes or any withdrawal charges the impact of other recurring charges including the mortality and expense risk charge distribution expense charge and contract maintenance fee on both yield figures is however reflected in them to the same extent it would affect the yield or effective yield for a contract of average size the separate account may advertise total return data for its variable portfolios total return figures are based on historical data and are not intended to indicate future performance the total return for a variable portfolio is a computed rate of return that when compounded annually over a stated period of time and applied to a hypothetical initial investment in a contract funded by that variable portfolio made at the beginning of the period will produce the same contract value at the end of the period that the hypothetical investment would have produced over the same period assuming a complete redemption of the contract at the end of the period the effect of applicable withdrawal charges due to the assumed redemption will be reflected in the return figures but may be omitted in additional return figures given for comparison for periods starting prior to the date the variable portfolios first became available through the separate account the total return data for the variable portfolios of the separate account will be derived from the performance of the corresponding underlying funds of seasons series trust trust modified to reflect the charges and expenses as if the contract had been in existence since the inception date of the trusts underlying fund further returns shown are for the original class of shares of the trust adjusted to reflect the fees and charges for the newer class of shares for class  until performance for the newer class becomes available however the actual shares purchased under this contract are class  of the trust returns of the newer class will be lower than those of the original class since the newer class of shares is subject to service fees of  for the trust the inception date of the class  shares in seasons series trust is november   in some cases a particular variable portfolio may have been available in another contract funded through this separate account if the variable portfolio was incepted in this separate account prior to the offering of this contract we report standardized contract performance adjusted for the fees and charges on this contract we commonly refer to these performance calculations as hypothetical adjusted historical returns performance figures similarly adjusted but based on underlying trusts performance outside of this separate account should not be construed to be actual historical performance of the relevant separate account variable portfolio rather they are intended to indicate the historical performance of the corresponding underlying funds of the trust adjusted to provide direct comparability to the performance of the variable portfolios after the date the  contracts were first offered to the public which will reflect the effect of fees and charges imposed under the contracts the trust has served since its inception as underlying investment media for separate accounts of other insurance companies in connection with variable contracts not having the same fee and charge schedules as those imposed under the contracts performance data for the various variable portfolios are computed in the manner described below cash management portfolio current yield is computed by first determining the base period return attributable to a hypothetical contract having a balance of one accumulation unit at the beginning of a  day period using the formula base period return  ev  sv  cmfsv where sv  value of one accumulation unit at the start of a  day period ev  value of one accumulation unit at the end of the  day period cmf  an allocated portion of the  annual contract maintenance fee prorated for  days the change in the value of an accumulation unit during the  day period reflects the income received minus any expenses accrued during such  day period the contract maintenance fee cmf is first allocated among the select portfolios focused portfolios andor strategies and the general account so that each select portfolios focused portfolios andor strategys allocated portion of the fee is proportional to the percentage of the number of accounts that have money allocated to that select portfolio focused portfolio andor strategy the fee is further reduced for purposes of the yield computation by multiplying it by the ratio that the value of the hypothetical contract bears to the value of an account of average size for contracts funded by the cash management portfolio finally as is done with the other charges discussed above the result is multiplied by the fraction  to arrive at the portion attributable to the  day period the current yield is then obtained by annualizing the base period return current yield  base period return x  the cash management portfolio also quotes an effective yield that differs from the current yield given above in that it takes into account the effect of dividend reinvestment in the underlying fund the effective yield like the current yield is derived from the base period return over a  day period however the effective yield accounts for dividend reinvestment by compounding the current yield according to the formula effective yield  base period return     the yield quoted should not be considered a representation of the yield of the cash management portfolio in the future since the yield is not fixed actual yields will depend on the type quality and maturities of the investments held by the underlying fund and changes in interest rates on such investments but also on factors such as an owners account size since the impact of fixed dollar charges will be greater for small accounts than for larger accounts yield information may be useful in reviewing the performance of the cash management portfolio and for providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives however the cash management portfolios yield fluctuates unlike bank deposits or other investments that typically pay a fixed yield for a stated period of time  other variable portfolios the variable portfolios of the separate account other than the cash management portfolio compute their performance data as total return total return for a variable portfolio represents a single computed annual rate of return that when compounded annually over a specified time period one five and ten years or since inception and applied to a hypothetical initial investment in a contract funded by that variable portfolio made at the beginning of the period will produce the same contract value at the end of the period that the hypothetical investment would have produced over the same period the total rate of return t is computed so that it satisfies the formula p   t to the power of n  erv where p  a hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years erv  redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the beginning of the   or  year period as of the end of the period or fractional portion thereof standardized performance for the portfolios and strategies available in this contract reflect total returns using the method of computation discussed below  using the four year surrender charge schedule available on contracts we may from time to time advertise other variations of performance along with the standardized performance as described above the total return figures reflect the effect of both nonrecurring and recurring charges the applicable withdrawal charge if any is deducted as of the end of the period to reflect the effect of the assumed complete redemption total return figures are derived from historical data and are not intended to be a projection of future performance fs variable annuity account five also funds other contracts which have been in existence longer than the seasons elite variable annuity the one year and since inception numbers for seasons elite are based on other products within fs variable annuity account five historical data which is adjusted for the fees and charges applicable to seasons elite and represent adjusted actual performance of the separate account these rates of return do not reflect election of the additional optional features as a fee is charged for these features the rates of return would be lower if these features were included in the calculations total return figures are based on historical data and are not intended to indicate future performance marketlock for two optional living benefit provisions marketlock for two what is marketlock for two marketlock for two is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit designed to help you create a guaranteed income stream for the life of two spouses thus marketlock for two may offer protection in the event your contract value declines due to unfavorable investment performance certain withdrawal activity a longer than expected life span or any combination of these factors the feature does not guarantee a withdrawal of an income stream based on any purchase payments made after the second contract anniversary the feature only guarantees lifetime withdrawals in the manner described below you may never need to rely on marketlock for two depending on your contracts market performance your withdrawal activity and your longevity the feature may not be appropriate if you plan to make ongoing purchase payments such as with contributory iras or taxqualified plans the feature guarantees only purchase payments received in the contracts first two years withdrawals under the feature are treated like any other withdrawal for the purpose of calculating taxable income deducting applicable withdrawal charges and reducing the contract value free withdrawal amounts and all other benefits features and conditions of your contract please see access to your money section in the prospectus  any withdrawals taken may be subject to a  irs tax penalty if your under age   at the time of the withdrawal for information about how the feature is treated for income tax purposes you should consult a qualified tax advisor concerning your particular circumstances if you take required minimum distributions and have elected this feature your distributions must be set up on the automated minimum distribution withdrawal program administered by our annuity service center in addition if you have a qualified contract tax law and the terms of the plan may restrict withdrawal amounts we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate marketlock for two at any time for prospectively issued contracts when and how may i elect marketlock for two you may only elect marketlock for two at the time of contract issue and this feature cannot be elected if you elect any other optional living benefit including marketlock to elect marketlock for two you must purchase the contract with your spouse as joint owner or you must designate your spouse as the sole primary beneficiary for nonqualified contracts the younger ownerspousal beneficiary must be at least age  and no older than age  for qualified contracts the owner and the spousal beneficiary must be at least age  and the owner must be no older than age  at the time of contract issue how does marketlock for two work marketlock for two automatically locksin the highest anniversary value during the first  years or  years if you extend the mav evaluation period as discussed below and guarantees annual withdrawals based on this amount over your lifetime and the lifetime of your spouse you may begin taking withdrawals immediately following the contract issue date the maximum annual withdrawal percentage represents the maximum percentage of your mav benefit base used to calculate the maximum annual withdrawal amount that you may withdraw each year and varies depending on the age of the younger spouse at the time of the first withdrawal marketlock for two summary table maximum annual age of the younger spouse withdrawal at time of first withdrawal percentage   at least age  but prior to rd birthday  at least age  but prior to th birthday  on or after th birthday   if you are taking required minimum distributions rmd from the contract and the portion of the rmd amount based on this contract is greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount defined below that portion of the withdrawal will not be treated as an excess withdrawal any portion of an rmd withdrawal that is based on amounts other than this contract will be considered an excess withdrawal please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock for two below how are the components for marketlock for two calculated first we determine the eligible purchase payments which include the amount of purchase payments received during the first two years after your contract issue date any purchase payments we receive more than two years after your contract issue date are considered ineligible purchase payments the calculation of eligible purchase payments does not include any spousal continuation contributions however spousal continuation contributions are included in the calculation of anniversary values as defined below see spousal continuation section in the prospectus eligible purchase payments are limited to  without prior company approval  second we consider the mav evaluation period which begins on your contract issue date and ends on your th contract anniversary on the expiration of the mav evaluation period you may contact us to extend the mav evaluation period for an additional period as discussed further below third we determine the anniversary value which equals the value of your contract on any contract anniversary during the mav evaluation period minus any ineligible purchase payments fourth we determine the mav benefit base initially the mav benefit base is equal to the first eligible purchase payment thereafter the mav benefit base is increased each time subsequent eligible purchase payments are made and adjusted each time any excess withdrawals are taken please see what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock for two below on each contract anniversary throughout the mav evaluation period the mav benefit base automatically adjusts upwards if the current anniversary value is greater than both the current mav benefit base and any previous years anniversary value other than adjustments made for excess withdrawals the mav benefit base will only be adjusted upwards and subsequent lower anniversary values through the mav evaluation period will not result in a lower mav benefit base finally we determine the maximum annual withdrawal amount which represents the maximum amount that may be withdrawn each benefit year and is an amount calculated by multiplying the current mav benefit base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage is determined based on the younger spouses age when you take your first withdrawal applicable percentages are shown in the marketlock for two summary table above if the mav benefit base is increased to the current anniversary value the maximum annual withdrawal amount is recalculated on that contract anniversary by multiplying the new mav benefit base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage if the mav benefit base is increased for any eligible purchase payments the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated upon receipt of each eligible purchase payments by multiplying the new mav benefit base by the applicable maximum annual withdrawal percentage what is the fee for marketlock for two the annualized fee for marketlock for two for all years in which the feature is in effect is calculated as  of the mav benefit base prior to any withdrawal being taken and  of the mav benefit base after the first withdrawal is taken however if you elect to extend the mav evaluation period the fee may change at the time of the extension you should keep in mind that an increase in the mav benefit base due to an adjustment to a higher anniversary value or due to subsequent eligible purchase payments will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee the fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your contract value allocated to the variable portfolios starting on the first quarter following your contract issue date and ending upon termination of the benefit the  fee applicable after the first withdrawal is assessed at the end of the quarter in which the withdrawal is taken if your contract value andor mav benefit base falls to zero before the  feature has been terminated the fee will no longer be deducted however if the mav benefit base is adjusted upwards at a later date because the current anniversary value is greater than both the current and any previous anniversary values the calculation and deduction of the fee will resume we will not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize your contract before the end of a contract quarter what are the effects of withdrawals on marketlock for two the maximum annual withdrawal amount and the mav benefit base may change over time as a result of the timing and amounts of withdrawals any withdrawals in a benefit year that in total are less than or equal to the maximum annual withdrawal amount do not reduce the mav benefit base we define excess withdrawals as either  any portion of a withdrawal that causes the total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount or  any withdrawal in a benefit year taken after the maximum annual withdrawal amount has been withdrawn excess withdrawals will reduce the mav benefit base in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the excess withdrawal excess withdrawals also result in a reduction to your maximum annual withdrawal amount because it is recalculated after each excess withdrawal by multiplying the reduced mav benefit base by the existing maximum annual withdrawal percentage in addition if in any year an excess withdrawal reduces the contract value to zero marketlock for two is terminated and you will not continue to receive withdrawals over your and your spouses lifetime the impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of marketlock for two are further explained below mav benefit base if the sum of withdrawals in any benefit year does not exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the mav benefit base is not reduced for those withdrawals excess withdrawals as described above reduce the mav benefit base as follows for each excess withdrawal taken the mav benefit base is reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by each excess withdrawal maximum annual withdrawal amount the maximum annual withdrawal amount is recalculated each time there is a change in the mav benefit base accordingly if the sum of withdrawals in any benefit year does not exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that year the maximum annual withdrawal amount will not change for the next year unless your mav benefit base is adjusted upward as described above under how are the components for marketlock for two calculated if you take an excess withdrawal the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated by multiplying the reduced mav benefit base by the existing maximum annual withdrawal percentage this newly recalculated maximum annual withdrawal amount will be available beginning on the next contract anniversary and may be lower than your previous maximum annual withdrawal amount for two please see below for examples of the effects of withdrawals what happens if the contract value is reduced to zero if the contract value is zero but the mav benefit base is greater than zero a benefit remains payable over your lifetime and the lifetime of your spouse however if at the time an excess withdrawal is taken your contract value is reduced to zero no benefit remains the contracts other benefits will be terminated once the contract value equals zero you may not make subsequent purchase payments or transfers and no death benefit or future annuity payments are available therefore during times of unfavorable investment performance withdrawals taken under the benefit may reduce the contract value to zero eliminating any other benefits of the contract  except as described above when the contract value equals zero to receive any remaining benefit you may select one of the following income options  the current maximum annual withdrawal amount paid equally on a quarterly semiannual or annual frequency as selected by you until the date of death of the surviving spouse or  lump sum distribution of the discounted present value as determined by us of the total remaining guaranteed withdrawals or  any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us if you do not select a payment option the remaining benefit will be paid as the current maximum annual withdrawal amount on a quarterly basis until the date of death of the surviving spouse can i extend the mav evaluation period beyond  years yes as long as the benefit is still in effect and the younger spouse is age  or younger at the time you elect the extension they may elect to extend the mav evaluation period we guarantee that you will be given the opportunity to extend the mav evaluation period under these conditions for at least one additional evaluation period of  years in order to extend the mav evaluation period you must contact us no later than  days after the end of the mav evaluation period if you elect to extend the mav evaluation period the mav benefit base can continue to be adjusted upward as described above on each anniversary during the new mav evaluation period see how are the components for marketlock for two calculated also if you extend the mav evaluation period you should note that the components of the feature such as the fee will change to those in effect at the time you elect to extend which may be different from the components when you initially elected the feature additional mav evaluation periods may be offered at our sole discretion if you do not contact us to extend the mav evaluation period the mav benefit base will no longer be adjusted for market gains on subsequent contract anniversaries however you can continue to take the maximum annual withdrawal amount in effect at the end of the last mav evaluation period subject to adjustments for excess withdrawals you will continue to pay the fee at the rate that was in effect during the last mav evaluation period and you will not be permitted to extend the mav evaluation period in the future  what happens to marketlock for two upon a spousal continuation the components of the feature will not change as a result of a spousal continuation a continuing spouse can elect to receive withdrawals in accordance with the provisions of the marketlock for two summary table above based on the age of the younger spouse when the first withdrawal was taken and based on the mav benefit base at the time of spousal continuation alternatively if contract value is greater than zero a continuing spouse may make a death claim under the death provisions of the contract and terminate the contract and the marketlock for two feature if spousal continuation occurs during the mav evaluation period the continuing spouse will continue to receive any upward adjustments due to market gains to the mav benefit base during the period and any spousal continuation contribution is included in the anniversary value however spousal continuation contributions are not considered to be eligible purchase payments in addition the continuing spouse will be eligible to extend the mav evaluation period upon the expiration of the initial period see can i extend the mav evaluation period beyond  years can a nonspousal beneficiary elect to receive any remaining benefits under marketlock for two upon the death of the second spouse no upon the death of both spouses if the contract value is greater than zero a nonspousal beneficiary must make an election under the death provisions of the contract which terminates marketlock for two see death benefits section in the prospectus  what happens to marketlock for two upon the latest annuity date if there is remaining contract value and the mav benefit base is greater than zero on the latest annuity date you must select one of the following options  annuitize the contract value under the contracts annuity provisions or  elect to receive the current maximum annual withdrawal amount on the latest annuity date paid equally on a quarterly semiannual or annual frequency as selected by you until the date of death of the surviving spouse if eligible for lifetime withdrawals even if the mav benefit base is zero or  any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us upon election of items   or  above the accumulation phase of your contract ends and the income phase begins therefore if electing income payments for the life of the annuitant upon death no benefit remains and the contract and its features will terminate can marketlock for two be cancelled marketlock for two may be cancelled on the th contract anniversary the th contract anniversary or any contract anniversary thereafter once marketlock for two is cancelled you will no longer be charged a fee and the guarantees under the benefit are terminated you may not extend the mav evaluation period and you may not reelect marketlock for two after cancellation are there circumstances under which marketlock for two will automatically terminate the feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of the following  annuitization of the contract or  full surrender of the contract or  a death benefit is paid and the contract is not continued by the spouse or  excess withdrawals that reduce the contract value to zero which then reduces the mav benefit base to zero or  death of surviving original spouse or  a change in ownership that involves the original owners except as noted below and under are there circumstances under which guaranteed withdrawals over the lifetime of your spouse is terminated if a change of ownership occurs from a natural person to a nonnatural entity the original natural owners must also be the annuitants after the ownership change to prevent termination of marketlock for two a change of ownership from a nonnatural entity to a natural person can only occur if the new natural owners was the original natural annuitants in order to prevent termination of marketlock for two any ownership change is contingent upon prior review and approval by the company  are there circumstances under which guaranteed withdrawals over the lifetime of your spouse is terminated under any of the following circumstances marketlock for two will provide a guarantee for your lifetime and not the lifetime of your spouse  one of the two original owners is removed from the contract or  the original spousal beneficiary is removed or replaced or  the original spousal joint owner or spousal beneficiary is removed or replaced upon divorce or  the original spousal joint owners or spousal beneficiary are no longer married at the time of death of the first spouse under these circumstances the original remaining owner continues to pay the fee for marketlock for two and receives the benefit for hisher lifetime only or may choose to terminate the feature as described under can marketlock for two be cancelled marketlock for two optional living benefit examples example  assume you elect marketlock for two and you invest a single purchase payment of  and that you make no additional purchase payments and no withdrawals before the st contract anniversary assume that on your st contract anniversary your contract value is  your initial mav benefit

 first we process the portion of your withdrawal that is not the excess withdrawal which is  your contract value after this portion of the withdrawal is     but your benefit base is unchanged next we recalculate your benefit base by reducing the benefit base by the proportion by which the contract value was reduced by the excess withdrawal    or  x  which equals  your new maximum annual withdrawal

calculated first we determine the eligible purchase payments which include the amount of purchase payments made to the contract during the first  days after your contract issue date adjusted for any withdrawals before the benefit availability date in the same proportion that the withdrawal reduced the contract value on the date of the withdrawal the calculation of eligible purchase payments does not include any payment enhancements andor spousal continuation contributions see spousal continuation section in the prospectus second we determine the withdrawal benefit base on the benefit availability date the withdrawal benefit base equals the sum of all eligible purchase payments third we determine the stepup amount if any which is calculated as a specified percentage listed in the seasons income rewards summary table above of the withdrawal benefit base on the benefit availability date if you elect option  or  you will not receive a stepup amount if you take any withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date if you elect option  the stepamount will be reduced to  of the withdrawal benefit base if you take any withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date the stepup amount is not considered a purchase payment and cannot be used in calculating any other benefits such as death benefits contract values or annuitization value fourth we determine the steppedup benefit base which is the total amount available for withdrawal under the feature and is used to calculate the minimum time period over which you may take withdrawals under the seasons income rewards feature the steppedup benefit base equals the withdrawal benefit base plus the stepup amount if any fifth we determine the maximum annual withdrawal amount which is a stated percentage listed in the seasons income rewards summary table above of the withdrawal benefit base and represents the maximum amount of withdrawals that are available under this feature each benefit year after the benefit availability date finally we determine the minimum withdrawal period which is the minimum period over which you may take withdrawals under the seasons income rewards feature the minimum withdrawal period is calculated by dividing the steppedup benefit base by the maximum annual withdrawal amount what is the fee for seasons income rewards the annualized seasons income rewards fee will be assessed as a percentage of the withdrawal benefit base the fee will be deducted quarterly from the portion of your contract value allocated to the variable portfolios starting on the first quarter following the contract issue date and ending upon the termination of the feature if your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been terminated the fee will no longer be assessed we will not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize before the end of a quarter  contract year annualized fee    years   years   none what are the effects of withdrawals on seasons income rewards the benefit amount maximum annual withdrawal amount and minimum withdrawal period may change over time as a result of withdrawal activity withdrawals after the benefit availability date equal to or less than the maximum annual withdrawal amount generally reduce the benefit by the amount of the withdrawal withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount will reduce the benefit in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced at the time of the withdrawal this means if investment performance is down and contract value is reduced withdrawals greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount will result in a greater reduction of the benefit the impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of seasons income rewards are further explained through the calculations below withdrawal benefit base withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date reduce the withdrawal benefit base in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced at the time of the withdrawal withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date also eliminate any stepup amount for options  and  and reduce the stepup amount to  of the withdrawal benefit base for option  withdrawals after the benefit availability date will not reduce the withdrawal benefit base until the sum of withdrawals after the benefit availability date exceeds the stepup amount thereafter any withdrawal or portion of a withdrawal will reduce the withdrawal benefit base as follows  if the withdrawal does not cause total withdrawals in the benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the withdrawal benefit base will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal or  if the withdrawal causes total withdrawals in the benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the withdrawal benefit base is reduced to the lesser of a or b where a is the withdrawal benefit base immediately prior to the withdrawal minus the amount of the withdrawal or b is the withdrawal benefit base immediately prior to the withdrawal reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the amount of the withdrawal steppedup benefit base since withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date eliminate any stepup amount for options  and  the steppedup benefit base will be equal to the withdrawal benefit base if you take withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date for option  if you take withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date the steppedup benefit base will be equal to the withdrawal benefit base plus the reduced stepup amount which will be  of the withdrawal benefit base adjusted for such withdrawals  if you do not take withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date you will receive the entire stepup amount and the steppedup benefit base will equal the withdrawal benefit base plus the stepup amount after the benefit availability date any withdrawal that does not cause total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount will reduce the steppedup benefit base by the amount of the withdrawal after the benefit availability date any withdrawal that causes total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount in that benefit year reduces the steppedup benefit base to the lesser of a or b where a is the steppedup benefit base immediately prior to the withdrawal minus the amount of the withdrawal or b is the steppedup benefit base immediately prior to the withdrawal reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the amount of the withdrawal maximum annual withdrawal amount if the sum of withdrawals in a benefit year does not exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that benefit year the maximum annual withdrawal amount does not change for the next benefit year if total withdrawals in a benefit year exceed the maximum annual withdrawal amount the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated at the start of the next benefit year the new maximum annual withdrawal amount will equal the steppedup benefit base on that benefit year anniversary divided by the minimum withdrawal period on that benefit year anniversary the new maximum annual withdrawal amount may be lower than your previous maximum annual withdrawal amounts minimum withdrawal period after each withdrawal a new minimum withdrawal period is calculated if total withdrawals in a benefit year are less than or equal to the current maximum annual withdrawal amount the new minimum withdrawal period equals the steppedup benefit base after the withdrawal divided by the current maximum annual withdrawal amount during any benefit year in which the sum of withdrawals exceeds the maximum annual withdrawal amount the new minimum withdrawal period equals the minimum withdrawal period calculated at the end of the prior benefit year reduced by one year contract value any withdrawal under the benefit reduces the contract value by the amount of the withdrawal please see below for examples of the effects of withdrawals what happens if my contract value is reduced to zero with seasons income rewards if the contract value is zero but the steppedup benefit base is greater than zero a benefit remains payable under the feature until the benefit base is zero however the contract and its features and other benefits will be terminated once the contract value equals zero once the contract is terminated you may not make subsequent purchase payments and no death benefit or future annuitization payments are available therefore under adverse market conditions withdrawals taken under the benefit may reduce the contract value to zero eliminating any other benefits of the contract to receive your remaining benefit you may select one of the following options  the current maximum annual withdrawal amount paid equally on a quarterly semiannual or annual frequency as selected by you until the steppedup benefit base equals zero or   lump sum distribution of the discounted present value as determined by us of the total remaining guaranteed withdrawals or  any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us if you do not select a payment option the remaining benefit will be paid as the current maximum annual withdrawal amount on a quarterly basis what happens to seasons income rewards upon a spousal continuation a continuing spouse may elect to continue or cancel the feature and its accompanying fee the components of the feature will not change as a result of a spousal continuation however continuation contributions are not considered to be eligible purchase payments see spousal continuation section in the prospectus can my nonspousal beneficiary elect to receive any remaining withdrawals under seasons income rewards upon my death if the contract value is greater than zero when the owner dies a nonspousal beneficiary must make a death claim under the contract provisions which terminates seasons income rewards see death benefits section in the prospectus if the contract value is zero when the owner dies meaning that no death benefit is payable but the steppedup benefit base is greater than zero a nonspousal beneficiary may elect to continue receiving any remaining withdrawals under the feature the components of the feature will not change can seasons income rewards be cancelled once you elect seasons income rewards you may not cancel the feature however there is no charge for seasons income rewards after the th contract anniversary additionally the feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of the following  the steppedup benefit base is equal to zero or  annuitization of the contract or  full surrender of the contract or  death benefit is paid or  upon a spousal continuation the continuing spouse elects not to continue the contract with the feature what happens to seasons income rewards upon the latest annuity date if your contract value and steppedup benefit base are greater than zero and you begin the income phase upon or before the latest annuity date you will not receive the benefit of any remaining guaranteed withdrawals under the feature your annuity income payments will be calculated using your contract value and the selected income option please see income options section in the prospectus important information about seasons income rewards seasons income rewards is designed to offer protection of your initial investment in the event of a significant market downturn seasons income rewards may not guarantee an income stream based on all purchase payments made into your contract seasons income rewards does not guarantee investment gains nor does it guarantee a withdrawal of any subsequent purchase payments made after the th day following the contract issue date this feature also does not guarantee lifetime income payments you may never need to rely on seasons income rewards if your contract performs within a historically anticipated range however past performance is no guarantee of future results  withdrawals under this feature are treated like any other withdrawal for the purpose of reducing the contract value free withdrawal amounts and all other benefits features and conditions of your contract please see access to your money section in the prospectus if you elect seasons income rewards and need to take withdrawals or are required to take required minimum distributions rmd under the internal revenue code from this contract prior to the benefit availability date you should know that such withdrawals may negatively affect the value of the benefit any withdrawals taken may be subject to a  irs tax penalty if you are under age   at the time of the withdrawal for information about how the feature is treated for income tax purposes you should consult a qualified tax advisor concerning your particular circumstances if you set up rmds and have elected this feature your withdrawals must be automated and will not be recalculated on an annual basis we reserve the right to modify suspend or terminate the seasons income rewards at any time for prospectively issued contracts seasons income rewards optional living benefit examples seasons income rewards example  of seasons income rewards assume you elect seasons income rewards option  and you invest a single purchase payment of  if you make no additional purchase payments and no withdrawals your withdrawal benefit base is  on the benefit availability date your steppedup benefit base equals withdrawal benefit base plus the stepup amount    x    your maximum annual withdrawal amount as of the benefit availability date is  of your withdrawal benefit base  x    the minimum withdrawal period is equal to the steppedup benefit base divided by the maximum annual withdrawal amount which is  years  therefore you may take up to  in withdrawals of up to  annually over a minimum of  years beginning on or after the benefit availability date example   impact of withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date for seasons income rewards options  and  assume you elect seasons income rewards option  and you invest a single purchase payment of  you make a withdrawal of  prior to the benefit availability date prior to the withdrawal your contract value is  you make no other withdrawals before the benefit availability date immediately following the withdrawal your withdrawal benefit base is recalculated by first determining the proportion by which your contract value was reduced by the withdrawal    next we reduce your withdrawal benefit base by the percentage by which the contract value was reduced by the withdrawal    x    since the stepup amount is zero because a withdrawal was made prior to the benefit availability date your steppedup benefit base on the benefit availability date equals your withdrawal benefit base therefore the steppedup benefit base also equals  your maximum annual withdrawal amount is  of the withdrawal benefit base on the benefit availability date  this equals  therefore you may take withdrawals of up to  annually over a minimum of  years     example   impact of withdrawals prior to the benefit availability date for seasons income rewards option  assume you elect seasons income rewards option  and you invest a single purchase payment of  you make a withdrawal of  prior to the benefit availability date prior to the withdrawal your contract value is  you make no other withdrawals before the benefit availability date immediately following the withdrawal your withdrawal benefit base is recalculated by first determining the proportion by which your contract value was reduced by the withdrawal    next we reduce your withdrawal benefit base by the percentage by which the contract value was reduced by the withdrawal    x    since the withdrawal occurred prior to the benefit availability date your stepup amount will be reduced to  of your withdrawal benefit base  x    therefore your steppedup benefit base on the benefit availability date equals the withdrawal benefit base plus the stepup amount      your maximum annual withdrawal amount is  of the withdrawal benefit base on the benefit availability date  this equals  therefore you may take withdrawals of up to  annually over a minimum of  years    example   impact of withdrawals less than or equal to maximum annual withdrawal amount after the benefit availability date for seasons income rewards assume you elect seasons income rewards option  and you invest a single purchase payment of  you make a withdrawal of  during the first year after the benefit availability date because the withdrawal is less than or equal to your maximum annual withdrawal amount  your steppedup benefit base  is reduced by the total dollar amount of the withdrawal  your new steppedup benefit base equals  your maximum annual withdrawal amount remains  your new minimum withdrawal period following the withdrawal is equal to the new steppedup benefit base divided by your current maximum annual withdrawal amount  therefore you may take withdrawals of up to  annually over a minimum of  years plus  in the last benefit year example   impact of withdrawals in excess of maximum annual withdrawal amount after the benefit availability date for seasons income rewards assume you elect seasons income rewards option  and you invest a single purchase payment of  your withdrawal benefit base is  and your steppedup benefit base is  you make a withdrawal of  during the first year after the benefit availability date your contract value is  at the time of the withdrawal because the withdrawal is greater than your maximum annual withdrawal amount  we recalculate your steppedup benefit base  by taking the lesser of two calculations for the first calculation we deduct the amount of the withdrawal from the steppedup benefit base      for the second calculation we deduct the amount of the maximum annual withdrawal amount from the steppedup benefit base      next we calculate the excess portion of the withdrawal  and determine the proportion by which the contract value was reduced by the excess portion of the withdrawal     finally we reduce  by that proportion  which equals  your steppedup benefit base is the lesser of these two calculations or  the minimum withdrawal period following the withdrawal is equal to the minimum withdrawal period at the end of the prior year  years reduced by one year  years your maximum annual withdrawal amount is your steppedup benefit base divided by your minimum withdrawal period  which equals   annuity income payments initial monthly annuity income payment the initial annuity income payment is determined by taking the contract value less any premium tax less any market value adjustment that may apply in the case of a premature annuitization of certain guarantee amounts and then applying it to the annuity table specified in the contract those tables are based on a set amount per  of proceeds applied the appropriate rate must be determined by the sex except where as in the case of certain qualified contracts and other employersponsored retirement plans such classification is not permitted and age of the annuitant and designated second person if any the dollars applied are then divided by  and the result multiplied by the appropriate annuity factor appearing in the table to compute the amount of the first monthly annuity payment in the case of a variable annuity that amount is divided by the value of an annuity unit as of the annuity date to establish the number of annuity units representing each variable annuity income payment the number of annuity units determined for the first variable annuity income payment remains constant for the second and subsequent monthly variable annuity income payments assuming that no reallocation of contract values is made subsequent monthly annuity income payments for a fixed annuity the amount of the second and each subsequent monthly annuity income payment is the same as that determined above for the first monthly payment the amount of the second and each subsequent monthly variable annuity income payment is determined by multiplying the number of annuity units as determined in connection with the determination of the initial monthly payment above by the annuity unit value as of the day preceding the date on which each annuity income payment is due annuity unit values the value of an annuity unit is determined independently for each variable portfolio the annuity tables contained in the contract are based on a  per annum assumed investment rate if the actual net investment rate experienced by a variable portfolio exceeds  variable annuity payments derived from allocations to that variable portfolio will increase over time conversely if the actual rate is less than  variable annuity income payments will decrease over time if the net investment rate equals  the variable annuity payments will remain constant if a higher assumed investment rate had been used the initial monthly annuity income payment would be higher but the actual net investment rate would also have to be higher in order for annuity income payments to increase or not to decrease the payee receives the value of a fixed number of annuity units each month the value of a fixed number of annuity units will reflect the investment performance of the variable portfolio elected and the amount of each annuity income payment will vary accordingly for each variable portfolio the value of an annuity unit is determined by multiplying the annuity unit value for the preceding month by the net investment factor for the month for which the annuity unit value is being calculated the result is then multiplied by a second factor which offsets the effect of the assumed net investment rate of  per annum which is assumed in the annuity tables contained in the contract net investment factor the net investment factor nif is an index applied to measure the net investment performance of variable portfolio from one month to the next the nif may be greater or less than or equal to one therefore the value of an annuity unit may increase decrease or remain the same  the nif for any variable portfolio for a certain month is determined by dividing a by b where a is the accumulation unit value of the variable portfolio determined as of the end of that month and b is the accumulation unit value of the variable portfolio determined as of the end of the preceding month the nif for a variable portfolio for a given month is a measure of the net investment performance of the variable portfolio from the end of the prior month to the end of the given month a nif of  results from no change a nif greater than  results from an increase and a nif less than  results from a decrease the nif is increased or decreased in accordance with the increases or decreases respectively in the value of the shares of the underlying investment portfolios in which the variable portfolio invests it is also reduced by separate account asset charges illustrative example assume that one share of a given variable portfolio had an accumulation unit value of  as of the close of the new york stock exchange nyse on the last business day in september that its accumulation unit value had been  at the close of the nyse on the last business day at the end of the previous month the nif for the month of september is nif     the change in annuity unit value for a variable portfolio from one month to the next is determined in part by multiplying the annuity unit value at the prior month end by the nif for that variable portfolio for the new month in addition however the result of that computation must also be multiplied by an additional factor that takes into account and neutralizes the assumed investment rate of  percent per annum upon which the annuity income payment tables are based for example if the net investment rate for a variable portfolio reflected in the nif were equal to the assumed investment rate the variable annuity income payments should remain constant ie the annuity unit value should not change the monthly factor that neutralizes the assumed investment rate of  percent per annum is    in the example given above if the annuity unit value for the variable portfolio was  on the last business day in august the annuity unit value on the last business day in september would have been  x  x    to determine the initial payment the initial annuity income payment for variable annuitization is calculated based on our mortality expectations and an assumed interest rate air of  thus the initial variable annuity income payment is the same as the initial payment for a fixed interest payout annuity calculated at an effective rate of  the nif measures the performance of the funds that are the basis for the amount of future annuity income payments this performance is compared to the air and if the growth in the nif is the same as the air rate the payment remains the same as the prior month if the rate of growth of the nif is different than the air then the payment is changed proportionately to the ratio nifair calculated on a monthly basis if the nif is greater than the air then this proportion is greater than one and payments are increased if the nif is less than the air then this proportion is less than one and payments are decreased  variable annuity income payments illustrative example assume that a male owner p owns a contract in connection with which p has allocated all of his contract value to a single variable portfolio p is also the sole annuitant and at age  has elected to annuitize his contract as a life annuity with  monthly payments guaranteed as of the last valuation preceding the annuity date ps account was credited with  accumulation units each having a value of  ie ps account value is equal to  x    assume also that the annuity unit value for the variable portfolio on that same date is  and that the annuity unit value on the day immediately prior to the second annuity income payment date is  ps first variable annuity income payment is determined from annuity rate tables using the information assumed above from the tables which supply monthly annuity income payments for each  of applied contract value ps first variable annuity payment is determined by multiplying the monthly installment of  option  tables male annuitant age  at the annuity date annuitizing in  by the result of dividing ps account value by  first payment   x    the number of ps annuity units which will be fixed ie it will not change unless he transfers his account to another account is also determined at this time and is equal to the amount of the first variable annuity income payment divided by the value of an annuity unit on the day immediately prior to annuitization annuity units     ps second variable annuity income payment is determined by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity unit value as of the day immediately prior to the second payment due date second payment   x    the third and subsequent variable annuity income payments are computed in a manner similar to the second variable annuity income payment note that the amount of the first variable annuity income payment depends on the contract value in the relevant variable portfolio on the annuity date and thus reflects the investment performance of the variable portfolio net of fees and charges during the accumulation phase the amount of that payment determines the number of annuity units which will remain constant during the annuity phase assuming no transfers from the variable portfolio the net investment performance of the variable portfolio during the annuity phase is reflected in continuing changes during this phase in the annuity unit value which determines the amounts of the second and subsequent variable annuity income payments additional provisions we will require proof of age and sex of the annuitant before making any life annuity income payment provided for by the contract if the age or sex of the annuitant has been misstated we will compute the amount payable based on the correct age and sex if annuity income payments have begun any underpayment that may have been made will be paid in full with the next annuity income payment including interest at the minimum annual rate of  any overpayments including interest at the minimum annual rate of  unless repaid to us in one sum will be deducted from future annuity income payments until we are repaid in full  if a contract provision requires that a person be alive we may require due proof that the person is alive before we act under that provision we will give the payee under an annuity income payment option a settlement contract for the payment option you may assign the contract prior to the annuity date you must send a dated and signed written request to our administrative office accompanied by a duly executed copy of any assignment we are not responsible for the validity of any assignment taxes general note we have prepared the following information on taxes as a general discussion of the subject it is not intended as tax advice to any individual you should consult your own tax adviser about your own circumstances section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code or irc governs taxation of annuities in general an owner is not taxed on increases in the value of a contract until distribution occurs either in the form of a nonannuity distribution or as income payments under the annuity option elected for a lumpsum payment received as a total surrender total redemption the recipient is taxed on the portion of the payment that exceeds the cost basis of the contract for a payment received as a withdrawal partial redemption federal tax liability is determined on a lastin firstout basis meaning taxable income is withdrawn before the cost basis of the contract is withdrawn a different rule applies to purchase payments made including if applicable in the case of a contract issued in exchange for a prior contract prior to august   those purchase payments are considered withdrawn first for federal income tax purposes followed by earnings on those purchase payments for nonqualified contracts the cost basis is generally the purchase payments the taxable portion of the lumpsum payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates tax penalties may also apply if you purchase your contract under a pension plan a specially sponsored employer program as an individual retirement annuity or under an individual retirement account your contract is referred to as a qualified contract examples of qualified plans or arrangements are individual retirement annuities and individual retirement accounts iras roth iras taxsheltered annuities also referred to as b annuities or b contracts plans of selfemployed individuals often referred to as hr  plans or keogh plans pension and profit sharing plans including k plans and governmental b plans typically for employer plans and taxdeductible ira contributions you have not paid any tax on the purchase payments used to buy your contract and therefore you have no cost basis in your contract however you normally will have a cost basis in a roth ira a roth b or a roth k account and you may have cost basis in a traditional ira or in another qualified contract for annuity payments the portion of each payment that is in excess of the exclusion amount is includible in taxable income the exclusion amount for payments based on a fixed annuity option is determined by multiplying the payment by the ratio that the cost basis of the contract if any and adjusted for any period or refund feature bears to the expected return under the contract the exclusion amount for payments based on a variable annuity option is determined by dividing the cost basis of the contract adjusted for any period certain or refund guarantee by the number of years over which the annuity is expected to be paid payments received after the investment in the contract has been recovered ie when the total of the excludable amount equals the investment in the contract are fully taxable the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for certain types of qualified plans there may be no cost basis in the contract within the meaning of section  of the code owners annuitants and beneficiaries under the contracts should seek competent financial advice about the tax consequences of any distributions  the company is taxed as a life insurance company under the code for federal income tax purposes the separate account is not a separate entity from the company and its operations form a part of the company withholding tax on distributions generally you have not paid any federal taxes on the purchase payments used to buy a qualified contract as a result most amounts withdrawn from the contract or received as income payments will be taxable income exceptions to this general rule include withdrawals attributable to aftertax roth ira roth b and roth k contributions withdrawals from roth iras are generally treated for federal tax purposes as coming first from the roth contributions that have already been taxed and as entirely tax free withdrawals from roth b and roth k accounts and withdrawals generally from qualified contracts are treated generally as coming prorata from amounts that already have been taxed and amounts that are taxed upon withdrawal withdrawals from roth ira roth b and roth k accounts which satisfy certain qualification requirements including at least five years in a roth account under the plan or ira and either attainment of age   death or disability or if an ira for the purchase of a first home will not be subject to federal income taxation the taxable portion of any withdrawal or income payment from a qualified contract will be subject to an additional  federal penalty tax under the irc except in the following circumstances o after attainment of age   o when paid to your beneficiary after you die o after you become disabled as defined in the irc o as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or joint expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary for a period of  years or attainment of age   whichever is later o payments to employees after separation from service after attainment of age  does not apply to iras o dividends paid with respect to stock of a corporation described in irc section k o for payment of medical expenses to the extent such withdrawals do not exceed limitations set by the irc for deductible amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care o payments to alternate payees pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order does not apply to iras o for payment of health insurance if you are unemployed and meet certain requirements  o distributions from iras for higher education expenses o distributions from iras for first home purchases o amounts distributed from a code section b plan other than amounts representing rollovers from an ira or employer sponsored plan to which the  penalty would otherwise apply the pension protection act of  created other distribution events and exemptions from the  early withdrawal penalty tax these include payments to certain reservists called up for active duty between september   and december   and payments up to  per year for health life and accident insurance by certain retired public safety officers which are federal taxfree the code generally requires the company or in some cases a plan administrator to withhold federal tax on the taxable portion of any distribution or withdrawal from a contract for eligible rollover distributions from contracts issued under certain types of qualified plans not including iras  of the distribution must be withheld unless the payee elects to have the distribution rolled over or transferred to another eligible plan in a direct trusteeto trustee transfer this requirement is mandatory and cannot be waived by the owner withholding on other types of distributions including distributions from iras can be waived an eligible rollover distribution is the taxable portion of any amount received by a covered employee from a traditional ira or retirement plan qualified under sections  or  or if from a plan of a governmental employer under section b of the code or from a taxsheltered annuity qualified under section b of the code other than  substantially equal periodic payments calculated using the life or life expectancy of the employee or joint lives or joint life expectancies of the employee and his or her designated beneficiary or for a specified period of ten years or more  financial hardship withdrawals and  minimum distributions required to be made under the code  distribution of contributions to a qualified contract which were made in excess of the applicable contribution limit failure to roll over the entire amount of an eligible rollover distribution including an amount equal to the  portion of the distribution that was withheld could have adverse tax consequences including the imposition of a federal penalty tax on premature withdrawals described later in this section only  the participant or  in the case of the participants death the participants surviving spouse or  in the case of a domestic relations order the participants spouse or exspouse may roll over a distribution into a plan of the participants own an exception to this rule is that a nonspousal beneficiary may subject to plan provisions roll inherited funds from an eligible retirement plan into an inherited ira an inherited ira is an ira created for the sole purpose of receiving funds inherited by nonspousal beneficiaries of eligible retirement plans the distribution must be transferred to the inherited ira in a direct trusteetotrustee transfer inherited iras must meet the distribution requirements relating to iras inherited by nonspousal beneficiaries under code sections a and b and a beginning in  subject to federal income limitations funds in a qualified contract may be rolled directly over to a roth ira  withdrawals or distributions from a contract other than eligible rollover distributions are also subject to withholding on the taxable portion of the distribution but the owner may elect in such cases to waive the withholding requirement if not waived withholding is imposed  for periodic payments at the rate that would be imposed if the payments were wages or  for other distributions at the rate of  if no withholding exemption certificate is in effect for the payee the rate under  above is computed by treating the payee as a married individual claiming  withholding exemptions diversification  separate account investments section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of nonqualified variable annuity contracts these requirements generally do not apply to qualified contracts which are considered pension plan contracts for purposes of these code requirements the code provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments are not adequately diversified in accordance with regulations prescribed by the united states treasury department treasury department disqualification of the contract as an annuity contract would result in imposition of federal income tax to the owner with respect to earnings allocable to the contract prior to the receipt of any payments under the contract the code contains a safe harbor provision which provides that annuity contracts such as your contract meet the diversification requirements if as of the close of each calendar quarter the underlying assets meet the diversification standards for a regulated investment company and no more than  of the total assets consist of cash cash items us government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies the treasury department has issued regulations which establish diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts such as the contracts the regulations amplify the diversification requirements for variable contracts set forth in the code and provide an alternative to the safe harbor provision described above under the regulations an investment portfolio will be deemed adequately diversified if  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any one investment  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any two investments  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any three investments and  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any four investments for purposes of determining whether or not the diversification standards imposed on the underlying assets of variable contracts by section h of the code have been met each united states government agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer nonnatural owners under section u of the code the investment earnings on premiums for the contracts will be taxed currently to the owner if the owner is a nonnatural person eg a corporation or certain other entities such contracts generally will not be treated as annuities for federal income tax purposes however this treatment is not applied to a contract held by a trust or other entity as an agent for a natural person or to contracts held by qualified plans purchasers should consult their own tax counsel or other tax adviser before purchasing a contract to be owned by a nonnatural person  multiple contracts the code provides that multiple nonqualified annuity contracts which are issued within a calendar year to the same contract owner by one company or its affiliates are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the federal tax consequences of any distribution such treatment may result in adverse tax consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed amounts from such combination of contracts for purposes of this rule contracts received in a section  exchange will be considered issued in the year of the exchange however they may be treated as issued on the issue date of the contract being exchanged for certain purposes including for determining whether the contract is an immediate annuity contract owners should consult a tax adviser prior to purchasing more than one nonqualified annuity contract from the same issuer in any calendar year tax treatment of assignments of qualified contracts generally a qualified contract including an ira may not be assigned or pledged one exception to this rule is if the assignment is part of a permitted loan program under an employersponsored plan or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order meeting the requirements of the plan or arrangement under which the contract is issued or in the case of an ira pursuant to a decree of divorce or separation maintenance or a written instrument incident to such decree tax treatment of gifting assigning or transferring ownership of a nonqualified contract under irc section ec if you transfer ownership of your nonqualified contract to a person other than your spouse or former spouse if incident to divorce for less than adequate consideration you will be taxed on the earnings above the purchase payments at the time of transfer if you transfer ownership of your nonqualified contract and receive payment less than the contracts value you will also be liable for the tax on the contracts value above your purchase payments not previously withdrawn the new contract owners purchase payments basis in the contract will be increased to reflect the amount included in your taxable income federal withdrawal restrictions from qualified contracts the irc limits the withdrawal of purchase payments from certain taxsheltered annuities tsas and certain other qualified contracts withdrawals can only be made when an owner  reaches age     in the case of section b plans  separates from employment from the employer sponsoring the plan  dies  becomes disabled as defined in the irc does not apply to section b plans or  experiences a financial hardship as defined in the irc in the case of hardship the owner can only withdraw purchase payments transfers of  amounts from one qualified contract to another investment option under the same plan or to another contract or account of the same plan type or from a qualified plan to a state defined benefit plan to purchase service credits are not considered distributions and thus are not subject to these withdrawal limitations such transfers may however be subject to limitations under the annuity contract or plan on july   the department of the treasury published final b regulations that are largely effective on january   these comprehensive regulations include several new rules and requirements such as a requirement that employers maintain their b plans pursuant to a written plan the final regulations subsequent irs guidance and the terms of the written plan may impose new restrictions on both new and existing contracts including restrictions on the availability of loans distributions transfers and exchanges regardless of when a contract was purchased prior to the effective date of the final regulations provisions applicable to taxfree transfers and exchanges both referred to below as transfers of b annuity contracts or custodial accounts became effective september   replacing existing rules under irs revenue ruling   transfer under these new rules transfers are available only to the extent permitted under the employers b plan once established additionally transfers occurring after september   that do not comply with these new rules can become taxable on january   or the date of the transfer whichever is later if you make a transfer to a contract or custodial account that is not part of the employers b plan other than a transfer to a contract or custodial account in a different plan and the provider and employer fail to enter into an information sharing agreement by january   the transfer would be considered a failed transfer that is subject to tax additional guidance issued by the irs generally permits a failed transfer to be corrected no later than june   by retransferring to a contract or custodial account that is part of the employers b plan or that is subject to an informationsharing agreement with the employer in general certain contracts originally established by a  transfer prior to september   are exempt or grandfathered from some of the requirements of the final regulations provided that no salary reduction or other contributions have ever been made to the contract and that no additional transfers are made to made to the contract on or after september   further contracts that are not grandfathered are generally required to be part of and subject to the requirements of an employers b plan upon its establishment but no later than by january   the new rules in the final regulations generally do not affect a participants ability to transfer some or all of a b account to a statedefined benefit plan to purchase service credits where such a transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable rules and requirements and with the terms of the employers plan you may wish to discuss the new regulations andor the general information above with your tax advisor partial  exchanges of nonqualified annuities section  of the code provides that a nonqualified annuity contract may be exchanged in a taxfree transaction for another nonqualified annuity contract historically it was generally understood that only the exchange of an entire annuity contract as opposed to a partial exchange would be respected by the irs as a taxfree exchange in  the us tax court ruled that the direct transfer of a portion of an annuity contract into another annuity contract  qualified as a taxfree exchange in  the irs acquiesced in that tax court decision but stated that it would nonetheless continue to challenge partial exchange transactions under certain circumstances in notice  published on july   the irs announced that pending the publication of final regulations it will consider all the facts and circumstances to determine whether a partial exchange and subsequent withdrawal from or surrender of either the surviving annuity contract or the new annuity contract within  months of the partial exchange should be treated as an integrated transaction and thus whether the two contracts should be treated as a single contract to determine the tax treatment of the surrender or withdrawal under section  of the code although notice  and the irss acquiescence in the tax court decision indicate that the irs will respect partial exchanges of annuity contracts under certain circumstances uncertainty remains and owners should seek their own tax advice regarding such transactions and the tax risks associated with subsequent surrenders or withdrawals qualified plans the contracts offered by this prospectus are designed to be available for use under various types of qualified plans taxation of owners in each qualified plan varies with the type of plan and terms and conditions of each specific plan owners and beneficiaries are cautioned that

determination that a security has incurred an otherthantemporary impairment in value and the amount of any loss recognized requires the judgment of the companys management and a continual review of its investments a security is considered a candidate for otherthantemporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria  trading at a significant  percent or more discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive months or longer  the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or  the company may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline such as that experienced in current credit markets in which the company could not reasonably assert that the recovery period would be temporary at each balance sheet date the company evaluates its securities holdings with unrealized losses when the company does not intend to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis based on the circumstances at the date of evaluation the company records the unrealized loss in income if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to changes in circumstances the loss is recognized in the

credit allowances and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount and premium interest income on such loans is accrued as earned impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral and commercial loans is based on certain risk factors and when collection of all amounts due under the contractual terms is not probable this impairment is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral interest income on such impaired loans is recognized as cash is received the company did not record a credit allowance for mortgage and other loans as of december   and  policy loans policy loans are carried at unpaid principal amount there is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the

correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market
