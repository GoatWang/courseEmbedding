analysis our stock selection process is centered on fundamental security analysis and emphasizes companies that are industry leaders or dominate certain niches these companies generally have certain competitive advantages or franchises our favorite idea is a company that earns a superior return on its capital and that we believe has the potential to continue to earn superior returns over many years we prefer companies that are strong cash flow generators our focus is on companies that produce cash in excess of their capital spending and dividend payouts this free cash can be utilized proactively on behalf of the shareholders possible applications include acquisitions share repurchases and increased dividends management should be skilled with respect to the allocation of the companys capital we take a close look at the management team which should have an ethical approach to doing business a commitment to the shareholders and an excellent track record we believe that management should own a meaningful longterm holding in the shares of their company we typically seek to purchase stocks at a discount to what we judge to be their intrinsic value we prefer to fill our portfolios with our favorite ideas purchased at compelling prices but only under relatively rare conditions can we find that many marvelous opportunities thus our portfolios may contain shares of good companies along with shares of outstanding ones we seek a greater discount to intrinsic value when a company does not fully meet all of our criteria we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in making judgments about the intrinsic value of a business our efforts are focused on traditional security analysis portfolio cash reserves can expand when we are unable to find a sufficient number of our preferred companies at suitable prices however we do not attempt to time the market by making macro judgments about the economy or the market   our services since  weik investment services has

advantages and a wide choice of investment options ameriprise financial offers a special beneficiary restriction for iras to control how assets are distributed you can consider by reviewing the potential benefits and risks a rollover from a k plan to an ira consult with your advisor to discuss your individual situation an individual retirement account ira can supplement your workplace retirement plan and provide an easy way to save for a confident retirement contributing to a traditional ira or roth ira may generate either taxdeferred or taxfree growth on the money you contribute these earnings are then reinvested into your account and may generate even more earnings traditional and roth iras there are two primary types of iras – traditional and roth each offers tax advantages and a wide variety of investment choices you can choose one or both depending on your tax situation and income but all iras together are subject to the combined contribution limit traditional iras are generally funded with pretax contributions and are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawing funds in retirement roth iras are always funded with aftertax contributions and are tax free when you withdraw the money in retirement you must satisfy rules on qualified distributions for the withdrawals to be considered taxfree you can make contributions throughout the year or in a lump sum by the contribution deadline usually the tax return due date — not including extensions — in the following year yearly contribution limits are subject to change workplace retirement plan rollovers if youve changed jobs or recently retired you may have multiple retirement plans with different providers a rollover from an old workplace retirement plan to an ameriprise® ira may provide you with a more complete picture of your savings for retirement some ameriprise iras also have a unique feature that allows clients to restrict some beneficiaries from using the funds too quickly a workplace

distribution flexibility than an employer plan is not subject to a mandatory  withholding when rolled directly to an ira provides flexible beneficiary and estate planning options maintains taxdeferred status of the account sometimes you can even rollover funds while you are still working however there are also some scenarios where it may make sense to leave assets in an employer plan some advantages to leaving assets in an employer qualified plan may include special tax treatment for a lump sum distribution of appreciated employer stock no  penalty for pre ½ withdrawals if you leave your employer in the year you turn  or later for certain public safety workers in governmental plans participants who stop working in the year they turn age  or can avoid the  penalty and b plans don’t have a  penalty at any age   protection of assets from creditors assets in erisa qualified plans are protected under federal law while ira asset protection outside of bankruptcy depends on state law access to competitively priced investments rollover assets to an ira while still employed by using this little known option you may be able to transfer assets from your workplace k into a personal ira while you’re still employed ask your advisor to help you explore the pros and cons of an inservice ira rollover strategy roth ira conversions you may want to consider converting a traditional ira to a roth ira a roth ira offers a number of benefits that are not available with a traditional ira or other pretax retirement plans including taxfree potential growth taxfree withdrawals no lifetime required minimum withdrawals a conversion of a pretax retirement plan to a roth ira is generally taxable in the year of the conversion so it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of a roth ira
