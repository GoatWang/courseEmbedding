daytoday challenges of running a successful privateequity investment firm but john canning jr is not out of the game by any means “nothing excites me more than generating transactions” says the chairman of madison dearborn partners llc pointing to its most recent purchase carybased sage products inc a health care product manufacturer still with two ceos taking care of the business mr canning 8 acknowledges that he has more time for other passions—his brady bunch family baseball a scholarship program for needy kids and museums mr canning sat down for a discussion agreeing to talk about anything but business he has an easygoing manner and admits to being triggerhappy and gaffeprone with emails mistakenly hitting “reply” instead of “forward” it was five years ago that mr canning was in the throes of a bidding war for the cubs his buyers group was a frontrunner maybe in part because baseball commissioner bud selig is a friend but when the bidding got to the billions he was nudged out then the economy tanked and businessman tom ricketts family claimed the team for just less than  billion about the same price mr canning initially had bid today he says hes glad to have lost out on the franchise “i couldnt stand the spotlight i started to really dislike that part of it” says mr canning talking in his thfloor office in the loop “besides im a sox fan” and he has a thing for the brewers along with owning an  percent stake in the team he has some sentimental love for milwaukee when he was just out of high school mr canning tried out for the braves before the team moved to atlanta “they had four days of tryouts and in four days i got one hit in  tries i was the slowest guy there so i played in college and ended my career” he says his passion for the game never waned however mr canning has a stake in four minorleague teams and is a regular at games in chicago and milwaukee and in phoenix for spring training he still had color on his cheeks from a trip to arizona earlier in march with his wife rita and some of their large brood “we like to travel together” says mr canning of bringing their children and grandchildren along for spring training the cannings each have three grown children from previous marriages and nine grandchildren all under age 0 it was a raucous vacation compared to the one he and ms canning took earlier this year to south africa unlike some of their peers they dont hunt but they relish views of the countryside this trip had them lounging on the famed blue train “you can dress for dinner smoke cigars its like downton abbey i loved it” mr canning says back in chicago he juggles business with work on the scholarship program he runs through the big shoulders fund the cannings offer 00 scholarships to needy children who want to attend catholic schools mr canning isnt catholic—or religious for that matter he says—but he likes the program in response to chicago public schools closing some schools he is adding 0 more scholarships mr canning also is on the board of northwestern memorial hospital and chairs the economic club and a year after he stepped down as board chair of the field museum his name has popped up as a possible successor to the late david speer who was chairman of the museum of science and industry he says he likes how the museum operates because it relies on exhibits instead of research the museum world he says is facing the challenge of a flat economy and pricey traveling exhibits “theyve all got to think out of the box to succeed” read more from shia kapos on her blog big shoulders
