barbarians bizantini saraceni and normans  normans  after the normans  feudalism  san francesco di paola  demographics  references historyedit amato is one of the oldest towns in calabria it is mentioned by the greek philosopher aristotle who calls it portus amati fluminis harbour of the amato river it is also mentioned by the roman pliny the elder in one of his books he calls it sinus lametinus lametino harbour it appears that the people of amato originated from the ancient city of lametia on the promontory of the gulf of santeufemia near the mouth of the amato river it was one of the most thriving cities of old calabria which at that time was called brettium sometimes referred to as bruttium from an english publication entitled brief history of amato we learn that amato existed many years before the foundation of rome from this book we also learn that at that time amato was very industrious and had a population of about  people its economy was centered around the very important textile industry with about  looms at work in fact even up to a few years ago many amatese women had a loom and many of them were very capable weavers production of the silkworm was also a very popular activity that primeval but progressive town was destroyed by floods many of its inhabitants perished others relocated to other cities like santeufemia nicastro sambiase bella etc few families relocated to the hills of the plateau of the amato river where they built a new town but kept the same name these people settled on the hills of piano di amato lachi cutro amendola and andressi this entire area was later called umbri and even today it is known by the same name umbri in latin means saved from the floods and it was here that these people built the new amato remains of two old churches san nicola and sant andrea and of a castle nearby are proof of the existence of amato at this location also during some excavation work a golden cross and golden chalice were found later on two workers pietro pingitore and francesco romeo both presently residing in winnipeg manitoba canada found in this same area some very old coins unfortunately all these were misplaced by the public authority before experts had an opportunity to study them the entire mediterranean basin suffered from attacks by pirates at this time and amato was not spared there was the risk of malaria a factor that affected the entire italian peninsula tuscany was particularly hard hit and malaria existed far inland in the veneto area reaching the italian alps the inhabitants of this new town alas did not have an easy time at their new location but they did not give up they just moved to higher grounds to the present location amato is located to the north of the catanzaro isthmus at an altitude of  metres above sea level between the gulfs of santeufemia and squillace this new town appears to have been built during the middle ages when the normans came to the amato plains in fact thanks to the normans the amato plains were fortified against pirate attacks they built castles at nicastro maida feroleto lamezia terme and one also at amato some of these norman castles still exist today their names are often preceded by the word rocca from the latin rock which means fortification some examples are rocca di neto rocca imperiale roccaraso to name a few first inhabitants – bcedit a woman in historical amatese dress the italias were the first established people of calabria later came the bretti from lucania these occupied calabria and called it bruzio the bruzi were very advanced culturally they dedicated themselves to agriculture and to the raising of domestic animals later they started handicrafts and industries promoted commerce and developed the exchange of their products with nearby people greeks – bcedit between the th and th century bc the greeks occupied the shores of calabria their first colonies soon became very wealthy and thriving by limiting their activities to the exchange of manufactured goods for agricultural products later they occupied all of southern italy and monopolized the entire commerce of the region thanks to the greeks calabria became a very industrious and productive region it was part of magna grecia romansedit during the war between the romans and pyrrhus the bruzi fought beside the army of taranto against the romans the romans defeated pyrrhus occupied taranto and all other cities of calabria including amato during the second punic war calabria was occupied by hannibal and the bruzi once again fought against the romans hannibal was defeated and calabria was roman again rome imposed some very harsh penalties to the inhabitants of calabria and many cities were burned down and destroyed was it then that amato was destroyed no one knows the contributions of amato during the punic wars are not known we do however know that amato at that time was located at a very strategic location in the gulf of santeufemia and therefore could have played a very important role barbarians bizantini saraceni and normansedit after the fall of the roman empire italy no longer guarded by the roman legions and was invaded by the barbarians during the dark ages that affected all of europe as well as the british isles the visigoths the ostrogoths the bizantini and the saracens attacked and looted everything that opposed them normansedit after the accord of melfi pope niccolo ii gave to the normans the government of calabria and puglia the normans were very democratic and enterprising we owe to them the creation of the abbey of sant eufemia lamezia the construction of the sanctuary of the madonna of dipodi the fortification of the amato plains and the introduction of the sugar cane under norman rule the amato plains enjoyed peace and prosperity under their rule pope callistro ii personally visited all the towns of the amato plains during this visit he inaugurated the sanctuary of dipodi consecrated the cathedral of nicastro the church of mileto and then he went to catanzaro to consecrate the church maggiore after the normans  feudalismedit from the st half of the  the history of amato begins to be better documented at that time the territory of amato was given to the feudatory francesco rodio of catanzaro by alfonso i king of naples then it was transferred to prince marcantonio of loffredo in  it was given to donato a mottola by the king of spain donato a mottola was given the title of marquis of amato after his death the territory amatese was inherited by his son orazio mottola who was also baron of joppolo coccorino and monterosso in  the territory of amato ceased to belong to the mottola family and was subdivided into small holdings the entire area was first called the university of amato and later commune of amato with the subdivision of the territory every resident of amato became a private landowner vast territories were granted to the wealthiest families anania caligiuri cantafio cianflone cosentino damico falvo fiorentino grande graziano jenzi lo scerbo lo schiavo mauro mazza mottola pallone papucci rossi todaro torchia who could date their ancestry to ancient rome the commune of amato kept for itself the forestland this was however contested by the mottola family a dispute later resolved by the king commissioner angelo masci under his ordinance the commune of amato was granted two thirds of its claim more specifically montagna soprana and montagna sottana the other one third was given to the mottola family the commune also received one half of the territory known as mugamero with the other half remaining to the mottolas with the subdivision of the amato territory many residents became minor landowners however many were unable to survive from these little farms and soon they sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families a fact that remains to this day while recent divisions among heirs has divided the large holdings the lands remain nonetheless within the same families noted above lands not cultivated by the wealthy landowners that were not needed for pasture were freely given to sharecroppers or tenant farmers who became responsible for the farming of the land and in return would keep  or  of the net production depending on the crop they were allowed to keep a pig a goat some sheep and chickens on the land to help them provide for their families this feudal system was practiced upto 9 it was improved over time for example by dr giuseppe caligiuri who improved productivity by putting at their disposal a plough pulled by two oxen dr caligiuris initiative was not well received by the other upper class they believed that this new approach to farming would benefit sharecropper more than it would benefit them instead of supporting this brilliant initiative the wealthy landowners closed themselves into a mean conservatism not well received by the sharecroppers this is partly the reason why the south has not developed into a riviera due primarily to the control of the wealthy ancient families over the years the tenant farmers left their lands they left amato and emigrated to the industrial factories of the north or moved to north america australia south america etc no doubt the italian spirit to create was partly to blame especially when the average calabrian tenant farmer of the early s with his plot of land his share of the crops and his livestock was a wealthy man compared to his london counterpart in england a fact that is vividly and accurately documented in real time by charles dickens san francesco di paolaedit central square monument for patron saint francesco of paola saint francesco of paola

the oldest towns in calabria it is mentioned by the greek philosopher aristotle who calls it portus amati fluminis harbour of the amato river it is also mentioned by the roman pliny the elder in one of his books he calls it sinus lametinus lametino harbour it appears that the people of amato originated from the ancient city of lametia on the promontory of the gulf of santeufemia near the mouth of the amato river it was one of the most thriving cities of old calabria which at that time was called brettium sometimes referred to as bruttium from an english publication entitled brief history of amato we learn that amato existed many years before the foundation of rome from this book we also learn that at that time amato was very industrious and had a population of about  people its economy was centered around the very important textile industry with about  looms at work in fact even up to a few years ago many amatese women had a loom and many of them were very capable weavers production of the silkworm was also a very popular activity that primeval but progressive town was destroyed by floods many of its inhabitants perished others relocated to other cities like santeufemia nicastro sambiase bella etc few families relocated to the hills of the plateau of the amato river where they built a new town but kept the same name these people settled on the hills of piano di amato lachi cutro amendola and andressi this entire area was later called umbri and even today it is known by the same name umbri in latin means saved from the floods and it was here that these people built the new amato remains of two old churches san nicola and sant andrea and of a castle nearby are proof of the existence of amato at this location also during some excavation work a golden cross and golden chalice were found later on two workers pietro pingitore and francesco romeo both presently residing in winnipeg manitoba canada found in this same area some very old coins unfortunately all these were misplaced by the public authority before experts had an opportunity to study them the entire mediterranean basin suffered from attacks by pirates at this time and amato was not spared there was the risk of malaria a factor that affected the entire italian peninsula tuscany was particularly hard hit and malaria existed far inland in the veneto area reaching the italian alps the inhabitants of this new town alas did not have an easy time at their new location but they did not give up they just moved to higher grounds to the present location amato is located to the north of the catanzaro isthmus at an altitude of  metres above sea level between the gulfs of santeufemia and squillace this new town appears to have been built during the middle ages when the normans came to the amato plains in fact thanks to the normans the amato plains were fortified against pirate attacks they built castles at nicastro maida feroleto lamezia terme and one also at amato some of these norman castles still exist today their names are often preceded by the word rocca from the latin rock which means fortification some examples are rocca di neto rocca imperiale roccaraso to name a few first inhabitants – bcedit a woman in historical amatese dress the italias were the first established people of calabria later came the bretti from lucania these occupied calabria and called it bruzio the bruzi were very advanced culturally they dedicated themselves to agriculture and to the raising of domestic animals later they started handicrafts and industries promoted commerce and developed the exchange of their products with nearby people greeks – bcedit between the th and th century bc the greeks occupied the shores of calabria their first colonies soon became very wealthy and thriving by limiting their activities to the exchange of manufactured goods for agricultural products later they occupied all of southern italy and monopolized the entire commerce of the region thanks to the greeks calabria became a very industrious and productive region it was part of magna grecia romansedit during the war between the romans and pyrrhus the bruzi fought beside the army of taranto against the romans the romans defeated pyrrhus occupied taranto and all other cities of calabria including amato during the second punic war calabria was occupied by hannibal and the bruzi once again fought against the romans hannibal was defeated and calabria was roman again rome imposed some very harsh penalties to the inhabitants of calabria and many cities were burned down and destroyed was it then that amato was destroyed no one knows the contributions of amato during the punic wars are not known we do however know that amato at that time was located at a very strategic location in the gulf of santeufemia and therefore could have played a very important role barbarians bizantini saraceni and normansedit after the fall of the roman empire italy no longer guarded by the roman legions and was invaded by the barbarians during the dark ages that affected all of europe as well as the british isles the visigoths the ostrogoths the bizantini and the saracens attacked and looted everything that opposed them normansedit after the accord of melfi pope niccolo ii gave to the normans the government of calabria and puglia the normans were very democratic and enterprising we owe to them the creation of the abbey of sant eufemia lamezia the construction of the sanctuary of the madonna of dipodi the fortification of the amato plains and the introduction of the sugar cane under norman rule the amato plains enjoyed peace and prosperity under their rule pope callistro ii personally visited all the towns of the amato plains during this visit he inaugurated the sanctuary of dipodi consecrated the cathedral of nicastro the church of mileto and then he went to catanzaro to consecrate the church maggiore after the normans  feudalismedit from the st half of the  the history of amato begins to be better documented at that time the territory of amato was given to the feudatory francesco rodio of catanzaro by alfonso i king of naples then it was transferred to prince marcantonio of loffredo in  it was given to donato a mottola by the king of spain donato a mottola was given the title of marquis of amato after his death the territory amatese was inherited by his son orazio mottola who was also baron of joppolo coccorino and monterosso in  the territory of amato ceased to belong to the mottola family and was subdivided into small holdings the entire area was first called the university of amato and later commune of amato with the subdivision of the territory every resident of amato became a private landowner vast territories were granted to the wealthiest families anania caligiuri cantafio cianflone cosentino damico falvo fiorentino grande graziano jenzi lo scerbo lo schiavo mauro mazza mottola pallone papucci rossi todaro torchia who could date their ancestry to ancient rome the commune of amato kept for itself the forestland this was however contested by the mottola family a dispute later resolved by the king commissioner angelo masci under his ordinance the commune of amato was granted two thirds of its claim more specifically montagna soprana and montagna sottana the other one third was given to the mottola family the commune also received one half of the territory known as mugamero with the other half remaining to the mottolas with the subdivision of the amato territory many residents became minor landowners however many were unable to survive from these little farms and soon they sold their possessions to other landowners thus contributing to the consolidation of large territories under the ownership of few families a fact that remains to this day while recent divisions among heirs has divided the large holdings the lands remain nonetheless within the same families noted above lands not cultivated by the wealthy landowners that were not needed for pasture were freely given to sharecroppers or tenant farmers who became responsible for the farming of the land and in return would keep  or  of the net production depending on the crop they were allowed to keep a pig a goat some sheep and chickens on the land to help them provide for their families this feudal system was practiced upto 9 it was improved over time for example by dr giuseppe caligiuri who improved productivity by putting at their disposal a plough pulled by two oxen dr caligiuris initiative was not well received by the other upper class they believed that this new approach to farming would benefit sharecropper more than it would benefit them instead of supporting this brilliant initiative the wealthy landowners closed themselves into a mean conservatism not well received by the sharecroppers this is partly the reason why the south has not developed into a riviera due primarily to the control of the wealthy ancient families over the years the tenant farmers left their lands they left amato and emigrated to the industrial factories of the north or moved to north america australia south america etc no doubt the italian spirit to create was partly to blame especially when the average calabrian tenant farmer of the early s with his plot of land his share of the crops and his livestock was a wealthy man compared to his london
