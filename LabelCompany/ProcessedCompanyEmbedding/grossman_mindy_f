the country as she did at nike nike had recently appointed its own new ceo and a new president so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company seeking this time one that was directtoconsumer entrepreneurial but not a startup and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances a recruiter approached her about iacinteractivecorp iac the parent company of hsn inc and after studying hsns broadcasts she realized that in her words hsn really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming particularly with charismatic celebrities with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and oldfashioned standard sales format she took the idea to barry diller the head of iac and even though she had no television experience no directtoconsumer experience and no experience in most of the product categories hsn sold he hired her in april  grossman was appointed ceo of iac retailing overseeing hsn the catalog company cornerstone brands shoebuycom and iacs international retailing operations hsn had had seven ceos in the previous  years and according to grossman the company offices and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time one of her first actions was to throw out all the old broken or dirty office furniture and give all employees aeron chairs in order to focus on revitalizing hsn she closed iacs failing uk auction business sold its german shopping channel closed the downmarket directv clearanceshopping channel and put another executive in charge of cornerstone brands she also eliminated negative or toxic employees sought out committed knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions and ensured that all employees were on board with the companys new vision she also found that the network and brand itself was a very stagnant linear nonimmersive experience by october  she rolled out hsns new brand image tagline vision statement customer intention and advertising the companys new manifesto was to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers to implement the plan she stopped selling  million worth of unsuitable brands and worked hard to entice higherend brands and new personalities to sell products among many others early on she recruited sephora emeril lagasse

company publicedit by mid  the relaunch and redesign of hsns channel website and campus were in effect and the business started to turn around in november of that year diller decided to break up iac

occurred with the subsequent stockmarket plunge and recession grossman kept hsn afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of  and  via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision and by tailoring hsns marketing to her customers needs to economize she continued to aggressively transform redefine and reinvent the hsn brand improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from  at its ipo in august  to  a share in  hsns success fostered the launch of a second hour television channel hsn in  grossmans turnaround approach was multifaceted she upgraded

not need to commute across the country as she did at nike nike had recently appointed its own new ceo and a new president so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company seeking this time one that was directtoconsumer entrepreneurial but not a startup and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances a recruiter approached her about iacinteractivecorp iac the parent company of hsn inc and after studying hsns broadcasts she realized that in her words hsn really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming particularly with charismatic celebrities with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and oldfashioned standard sales format she took the idea to barry diller the head of iac and even though she had no television experience no directtoconsumer experience and no experience in most of the product categories hsn sold he hired her in april  grossman was appointed ceo of iac retailing overseeing hsn the catalog company cornerstone brands shoebuycom and iacs international retailing operations hsn had had seven ceos in the previous  years and according to grossman the company offices and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time one of her first actions was to throw out all the old broken or dirty office furniture and give all employees aeron chairs in order to focus on revitalizing hsn she closed iacs failing uk auction business sold its german shopping channel closed the downmarket directv clearanceshopping channel and put another executive in charge of cornerstone brands she also eliminated negative or toxic employees sought out committed knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions and ensured that all employees were on board with the companys new vision she also found that the network and brand itself was a very stagnant linear nonimmersive experience by october  she rolled out hsns new brand image tagline vision statement customer intention and advertising the companys new manifesto was to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers to implement the plan she stopped selling  million worth of unsuitable brands and worked hard to entice higherend brands and new personalities to sell products among many others early on

desired a ceo position preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at nike nike had recently appointed its own new ceo and a new president so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company seeking this time one that was directtoconsumer entrepreneurial but not a startup and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances a recruiter approached her about iacinteractivecorp iac the parent company of hsn inc and after studying hsns broadcasts she realized that in her words hsn really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming particularly with charismatic celebrities with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and oldfashioned standard sales format she took the idea to barry diller the head of iac and even though she had no television experience no directtoconsumer experience and no experience in most of the product categories hsn sold he hired her in april  grossman was appointed ceo of iac retailing overseeing hsn the catalog company cornerstone brands shoebuycom and iacs international retailing operations hsn had had seven ceos in the previous  years and according to grossman the company offices and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time one of her first actions was to throw out all the old broken or dirty office furniture and give all employees aeron chairs in order to focus on revitalizing hsn she closed iacs failing uk auction business sold its german shopping channel closed the downmarket directv clearanceshopping channel and put another executive in charge of cornerstone brands she also eliminated negative or toxic

brands and new personalities to sell products among many others early on she recruited sephora emeril lagasse and todd english to sell on air she also aired a twohour fashion show of highend apparel
