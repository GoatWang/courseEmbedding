endonovos immunotronics™ platform is a noninvasive nonimplantable bioelectronic device for treatingpreventing vital organ failure through the reduction of inflammation and cell death endonovos cytotronics™ platform uses our proprietary bioelectronic technology to create nextgeneration cell therapies and for the production of fully human biomolecules such as cytokines and growth factors our immunotronic technology uses noninvasive electromagnetic pulses to deliver electrical stimulation via inductive coupling to the nervous system and cells our technology was identified in preclinical studies to be an innovative approach for treating acute inflammation we are targeting inflammatory conditions in vital organs and have set the initial concentration on treating inflammation in the liver our cytotronics platform is currently being developed to create nextgeneration more biologically potent cell therapies we are currently using this technology to create an offtheshelf therapy for the treatment of graftversushost disease a rare complication following allogeneic tissue transplants such as bone marrow and cord blood transplants wherein immune cells in the transplanted tissue the graft recognize the recipient the host as foreign and begin to attack the hosts cells acute gvhd can result in significant damage to the liver skin mucosa and the gastrointestinal tract and is a major issue associated with high morbidity and mortality in transplants our cell therapy is an hla double negative hla  cell mixture created using stem cells from the human umbilical cord and adipose tissue that does not require a tissue match our mission is to save lives by treating and preventing vital organ failure using noninvasive bioelectronic medicine view detailed stock data stock snapshot endv

regenerative medicine cytotronics and tvemf technology cytotronics™ platform tom allinder cytotronics™ platform our cytotronics™ platform uses timevarying electromagnetic field tvemf technology to expand and enhance the therapeutic properties of stem cells immune cells and for use in tissue engineering the goal of our cytotronics™ platform is to create optimized cellbased therapies with greater therapeutic potential than the unmodulated cells currently being used in regenerative medicine the origins of our cytotronics™ platform dates back to experiments conducted at nasa to expand stem cells ex vivo and to create therapies that could be used to treat astronauts during long term space exploration the results of those experiments revealed that timevarying electromagnetic fields tvemf could be used to expand stem cells in the lab and resulted in the increased expression of dozens of genes related to cell growth tumor suppression cell adhesion and extracellular matrix production a physics approach to biology – ex vivo modulation we have built upon over  years of research and development to create a novel therapeutic paradigm – the systematic enhancement of the biological and therapeutic properties of cells ex vivo this allows for the creation of a precise scalable and cost effective approach to maximize the safety and effectiveness of cellbased therapies while our competitors are using genetic modification and pharmacological modulation to alter and enhance the biological properties of cells we are taking a physics approach to biology™ in the use of bioelectronics to create ex vivo modulated cells with enhanced biological and therapeutic properties using our cytotronics™ platform we are able to create cells that express higher levels of key genes related to stem cell maintenance cell growth cell homing and engraftment cytotronic™ expansion of peripheral blood stem cells resulted in an over fold expansion of cd cells in as few as  days our cytotronic™ platform was shown to be able to maintain normal human neural progenitor nhnp cells in long term culture  days undifferentiated with the ability to be cryogenically preserved then subsequently reintroduced into culture with stem and progenitor markers still intact nhnp cells that were expanded using our technology were then shown to not be tumorigenic when introduced into nude athymic mice for  days multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization mfish showed that there was no chromosomal damage to cells subjected to timevarying electromagnetic fields tvemf perivascular cell therapy created using cytotronics™ each year an estimated  patients with leukemia and lymphoma need bone marrow transplantation however only  of those patients actually receive a transplant primarily because the other  patients are unable to find a fully matched bone marrow donor umbilical cord blood from newborn children is an excellent source of hematopoietic stem cells for stem cell transplants because their immune system is still immature and the stem cells have a lower probability of inducing an adverse immune response in patients furthermore a perfect immunological match between donor and recipient is not necessary unlike in bone marrow transplants however in most cases a unit of umbilical cord blood contains too few stem cells to treat an adult patient and its use is confined above all to the treatment of children numerous patients have better matched cord blood products available  or  hla match however those products have low cell doses and are not suitable for use in adult patients this is one of the reasons why less than  percent of cord blood collected in the united states is ever used low volume cord blood units present the opportunity to expand andor enhance these unused cord blood units for the widespread use of hematopoietic stem cells in regenerative medicine offtheshelf therapeutic our perivascular cell therapy is created using immunologically privileged and immunemodulating stem cells from a portion of the human umbilical cord and cocultured with adiposederived stem cells along with cord blood cells to create a perivascular cell mixture that can be used to treat malignant and nonmalignant hematological disorders endonovo’s cell therapy is an offtheshelf therapeutic that can be stored indefinitely in a low temperature freeze without requiring cryopreservation our technologies are particularly suited to expand the use and effectiveness of lowvolume cord blood units more in vivolike stem cells our offtheshelf therapeutic is created in a threedimensional bioreactor using our proprietary cytotronics™ platform to further expand and enhance the biological properties of the stem cells within the perivascular cell mixture our use of a perivascular coculture in a threedimensional bioreactor is meant to mimic the way that bloodforming stem cells renew and reside in the body this simulated stem cell niche allows for the expansion of longterm selfrenewing stem cells researchers had previously identified endothelial and perivascular cells as the cells that were functionally responsible for the maintenance of bloodforming stem cells hscs in the body our technologies provide a method for the expansion of hscs in an environment that resembles their native stem cell niche endonovo is using a threedimensional bioreactor that allows for the largescale expansion of bloodforming stem cells that enhances celltocell contact between perivascular cells and hscs providing a culture method that more closely resembles the stem cell niche as seen below a cells grown in threedimensions become more spherical that those grown in b static twodimensional cultures cells grown two dimensionally in petri dishes or tflasks sink within their growth medium these cells do not look or function like real human cells which grow threedimensionally in the body recent posts hanover acquires biotechnology company using timevarying electromagnetic
