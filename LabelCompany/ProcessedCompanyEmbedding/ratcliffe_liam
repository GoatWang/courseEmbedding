unum’s existing investors – fidelity biosciences atlas venture and sanofigenzyme bioventures – also participated in the oversubscribed round in addition seattle genetics inc nasdaq sgen made a  million equity investment in this round as part of the strategic collaboration between the companies announced earlier this week liam ratcliffe md phd managing director at new leaf venture partners who has been appointed to the unum board of directors stated “we are thrilled to lead this financing into unum the ability to combine t cell therapy with a range of antibodies provides unum a truly novel platform with numerous advantages including rapidly developing cell therapies against multiple targets the company is led by a worldclass team and together with the strength of this syndicate is wellpositioned to translate this potential into reality for cancer patients and all stakeholders” the proceeds from the financing will be used to advance the unum’s novel antibodycoupled tcell receptor actr technology platform and support the expansion of the company’s proprietary pipeline of actr therapies targeting a broad range of hematological and solid tumor targets “this is a unique time in the battle to develop cancer therapies across the industry we’re seeing truly profound patient responses achieved by directing the immune system to attack tumor cells this series b funding will be critical for unum enabling us to advance our engineered tcell therapy through clinical proofofconcept and to simultaneously create a pipeline of programs targeting a range of cancer indications” said charles wilson phd president and chief executive officer of unum therapeutics “we are excited at the opportunity to use our actr cell therapy to address the unmet medical needs of patients with hematologic or solid tumor cancers” about actr technology actr is a chimeric protein that combines components from receptors normally found on two different human immune cell types – natural killer nk cells and tcells – to create a novel cancer cell killing activity tcells bearing the actr receptor can be directed to attack tumor cells by providing a monoclonal antibody that binds to antigens on the cancer cell surface and then acts as a bridge to the actr tcell enabling tumor cell killing unum has built a platform for cancer treatment based upon actr in contrast to other approaches that are limited to a single target and treat a narrow set of tumors unum’s approach is not restricted by antigen and may have applications for treating many types of cancers about unum therapeutics unum therapeutics uses proprietary tcell engineering technology in combination with tumortargeting antibodies to activate the body’s own immune system to fight cancer unum’s lead program based on its antibodycoupled tcell receptor actr technology recently entered phase  clinical testing to assess safety and efficacy the company is headquartered in cambridge ma for more information
