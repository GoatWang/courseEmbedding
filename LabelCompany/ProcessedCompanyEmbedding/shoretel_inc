premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why shoretel inc stock plunged today the telecommunications products specialist fell short in its latest quarter steve symington tmfsymington apr   at pm image source shoretel inc what shares of shoretel nasdaq shor dropped  friday after the telecommunications vendor announced weakerthanexpected fiscal thirdquarter  results so what quarterly revenue rose  year over year to  million and based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap translated to a net loss of  million or  per share on an adjusted nongaap basis which excludes items like stockbased compensation and acquisitions expenses shoretels net loss came in at  million or  per share compared to adjusted net income of  million or  per share in the same yearago period analysts on average were anticipating a narrower adjusted net loss of  per share and higher revenue of  million shoretel ceo don joos focused on what went right stating in the fiscal third quarter we accelerated both cloud bookings and hosted revenue with particular strength from midmarket and enterprise customers we continued to execute on our five catalysts for growth as we introduced new shoretel connect features expanded our cloud geographic footprint and launched the premises to cloud migration program to leverage our installed base to drive hosted revenue growth hosted revenue climbed  year over year to  million and shoretels total number of installed customer seats rose  to  meanwhile support and services revenue rose  year over year to  million and recurring revenue which is comprised of combined revenue from hosted and related services as well as support represented  of shoretels total revenue during the quarter however this growth was almost entirely offset by a  yearoveryear decline in product revenue to  million now what for the current quarter shoretel anticipates revenue of  million to  million well below analysts consensus estimates calling for  million shoretel is undeniably making progress capitalizing on its strategicgrowth catalysts but investors cant ignore the fact that progress is being thwarted by declines in its coreproducts segment given
