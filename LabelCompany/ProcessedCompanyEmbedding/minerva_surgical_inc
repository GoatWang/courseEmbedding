patented uterine integrity test uit – automatically checks the integrity of the uterine cavity cervical sealing balloon – seals the cervical canal near the internal os no measurement entry needed – no uterine length  width controller entries are required  mechanisms of ablation the minerva endometrial ablation system is intended to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia excessive bleeding due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete the minerva endometrial ablation system utilizes electrical current to ionize argon gas that is fully contained and circulated within a sealed silicone membrane when this stretchable silicone membrane is deployed it conforms to the uterus when the system is energized the argon gas is ionized turning it in to plasma the argon plasma heats the silicone membrane and this thermal heat is conducted to the tissue in contact with the membraneduring the ablation cycle the minerva system does not proactively evacuate the liquid contents from the uterine cavity these liquids remain in the uterine cavity are heated by the silicone membrane and the retained heated liquids are used to ablate the endometrial tissue along with the tissue penetrating bipolar rf current in an impedancemediated resistive heating environment the combination of three mechanisms of ablation creates a uniform and reproducible ablation of the endometrium hot array membrane plasma releases thermal energy in the form of heat which ablates surrounding endometrial tissue that is in direct contact with the silicone array membrane heated intracavitary fluids hot retained cavity fluids heated by the membrane ablate tissue not in direct contact with the silicone array membrane rf energy endometrial tissue is ablated with penetrating bipolar rf electrical current which also creates plasma by ionizes the argon ar gas that is fully contained in the silicone array membrane design aspects of the minerva system
