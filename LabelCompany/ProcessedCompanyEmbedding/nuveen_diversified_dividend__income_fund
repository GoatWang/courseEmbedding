estate values rents property taxes interest rates and tax laws in addition to geographical concentration riskssenior loan risk senior loans both secured and unsecured may not be rated by a national rating agency are  generally not registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and generally are not listed on a securities exchange consequently the amount of public information available about senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for more widely rated registered and exchangelisted securities  in addition some adjustable rate loans may be unsecured or insufficiently collateralized which increases the risk of fund losses if the loan’s issuer defaultscredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or
