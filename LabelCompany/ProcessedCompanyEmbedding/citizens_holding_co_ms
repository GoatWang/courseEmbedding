increase table of contents the following table shows the interest and fees and corresponding yields for loans only for the three months ended september    interest and fees     average gross loans   annualized yield     the increase in interest rates on loan accounts in the three months ended march   reflects the increase in all loan interest rates for both new and refinanced loans in the period credit loss experience as a natural corollary to the corporations lending activities some loan losses are to be expected the risk of loss varies with the type of loan being made and the overall creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan the degree of perceived risk is taken into account in establishing the structure of and interest rates and security for specific loans and for various types of loans the corporation attempts to minimize its credit risk exposure by use of thorough loan application and approval procedures the corporation maintains a program of systematic review of its existing loans loans are graded for their overall quality those loans which management determines require further monitoring and supervision are segregated and reviewed on a regular basis significant problem loans are reviewed monthly by the corporations management and board of directors the corporation charges off that portion of any loan that the corporations management and board of directors has determined to be a loss a loan is generally considered by management to represent a loss in whole or in part when exposure beyond the collateral value is apparent servicing of the unsecured portion has been discontinued or collection is not anticipated based on the borrowers financial condition the general economic conditions in the borrowers industry influence this determination the principal amount of any loan that is declared a loss is charged against the corporations allowance for loan losses the corporations allowance for loan losses is designed to provide for loan losses that can be reasonably anticipated the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to operating expenses in the form of provisions for loan losses actual loan losses or recoveries are charged or credited to the allowance for loan losses the board of directors determines the amount of the allowance among the factors considered in determining the allowance for loan losses are the current financial condition of the corporations borrowers and the value of security if any for their loans estimates of future economic conditions and their impact on various industries and individual borrowers are also taken into consideration as are the corporations historical loan loss experience and reports of banking regulatory authorities as these estimates factors and evaluations are primarily judgmental no assurance can be given as to whether the corporation will sustain loan losses in excess or below its allowance or that subsequent evaluation of the loan portfolio may not require material increases or decreases in such allowance table of contents the following table summarizes the corporations allowance for loan losses for the dates indicated quarter ended year ended amount of percent of march  december  increase increase   decrease decrease balances gross loans          allowance for loan losses       nonaccrual loans      ratios allowance for loan losses to gross loans     net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses     the provision for loan losses for the three months ended march   was negative  a decrease of  from the  provision for the same period in  the change in the corporations loan loss provisions for the three months ended march   is a result of managements assessment of inherent loss in the loan portfolio including the impact caused by current local national and international economic conditions the corporations model used to calculate the provision is based on the percentage of historical chargeoffs applied to the current loan balances by loan segment and specific reserves applied to certain impaired loans nonaccrual loans decreased during this period due to the amount of payments received and loans charged off in excess of new loans being added to the nonaccrual loan list for the three months ended march   net loan losses charged to the allowance for loan losses totaled  a decrease of  from the  charged off in the same period in  the decrease was mainly due to a charge off in  on a single loan in the amount of  on commercial real estate for which the corporation had previously provided a specific reserve against this loss through the provision for loan loss management reviews quarterly with the corporations board of directors the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses the loan loss provision is adjusted when specific items reflect a need for such an adjustment management believes that there were no material loan losses during the three months ended march   that have not been charged off management also believes that the corporations allowance will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the corporations loan portfolio however it remains possible that additional provisions for loan loss may be required table of contents other income    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage these wealthy parents spend  for
