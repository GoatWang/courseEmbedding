 phys is actually a closedend fund not an etf  for more information see phys is not an etf sprott physical gold trust phys the latest physically backed gold exchangetraded product began trading yesterday  on the nyse  the fund also applied for listing on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol phy but it appears that canadian trading has not yet commenced  the fund will be managed by torontobased sprott asset management and will store its gold at the royal canadian mint with the introduction of phys investors can now choose between physically backed etfs that safeguards gold bullion in zurich canada london and us vaults  the fund’s new website does not contain much information at this time  the prospectus highlights the potential benefits of the offering which include ability to redeem units for physical gold bullion unit holders will have the ability on a monthly basis to redeem their units for physical gold bullion in a minimum of one bar  to  troy ounces for a redemption price equal to  of the nav minus expenses storage at the royal canadian mint the trust’s physical gold bullion will be fully allocated and stored at the royal canadian mint potential tax

longterm capital gains tax rate of  applicable to physical gold bullion and other “collectibles” provided that such us investor has made a timely and valid qualified electing fund election with respect to the units note i recommend consulting a qualified tax specialist if you are relying on this claim phys will have expenses capped at  making it more expensive than its major competitors

strongman shelford on february   at  am nice to see some competition for gld sprott has a solid reputation i wish good luck for this new enterprise strongman shelford httpthenewbiesilverinvestorblogspotcom myron on february   at  am welcome news with the doubts about whether gld and slv actually hold the actual metals they claim the reputation of sprott makes a higher management fee acceptable i simply do not trust american bankers or for that matter the politicians who allowed the financial debacle to take place in the first place i have no objections to hard working contributing people becoming wealthy through legitimate business activities that serve people with superior products and services on the contrary the bonuses being paid to the manipulators leaches and parasites who constitute the major american banking houses and their ponzi schemes are simply obscene and they should get the same treatment as bernie madoff not millions in bonuses this is capitalism run amok i am delighted that men of principle are putting their money where their mouth is and giving the average investor opportunity to invest in honest money that unlike fiat paper currencies will preserve purchasing power dave roberts on february   at  pm whats up i called the rcm got ahold of a employee that said their not a warehouse and they store only enough for minting coins and that kitco used to claim the same thing he went on to say they didnt have the room for them “kitco” and dosn’t know what i was talking about sprott gold trust sincerely look before you leap dave wrobel on february   at  pm has john embry purchased any shares of phy ian mathers on march   at  am i didn’t believe it when kitco was advertising rcm storage because the mint is a crown corporation and never offered storage to anyone now kitco offers it through questrade whose site claims it is the first to give you the option of holding physical gold or silver in your rrsp resp canadian taxfree retirement and education funds although central fund of canada – an etf has been doing so since the mid ’s they audit frequently and have a proven record of integrity even though i have part of my rrsp in this fund i still prefer to hold the physical metal myself if you don’t have it in your hand you don’t really own it and if the investment is known to – or registered with – the government you have only paid for an interest in something the government and the banks will control reject their tax refund bait buy pm with your aftertax money and keep it very close dave webster on march   at  am finally a gold etf that actually has physical gold and allocates it in your name for a slightly higher expense fee than the other paper etf’s its fantastic considering the other etf’s may not have any physical gold at all and if they do it would be a very small amount on a  basis their expense ratios are exhorbitant for the gold they actually have congratulations to sprott i expect this etf to be the  etf in no time at all people will eventually flow their money to a product that’s real ian mathers on march   at  pm dave it could be said that all etf’s such as cefato allocate the gold or silver in your name but considering the claim that this one will both allocate it for you and store it at the royal canadian mint would make me very leary it might become the no  but that really means nothing if you have no more than a piece of paper ian mathers on march   at  pm allocated my hairy butt unit holders will have the ability on a monthly basis to redeem their units for physical gold bullion in a minimum of one bar  to  troy ounces if i had enough cash to ‘allocate’ even one  oz bar of gold i wouldn’t be beggin’ the gobment for my tax refund ron rowland on march   at  am the allocation will not be done at the individual share holder level it will only be done at the fund level ian mathers on march   at  pm my understanding of ‘allocation’ has always been that the investor has a specific item earmarked and that the investor is further given a serial no or some other identifiable indication that this actually exists and is unique if you have a share in something with a multitude of other claims on it then it is not allocated – it is a pool account ron rowland on march   at  pm correct except in this case the investor is the fundtrust the fund’s assets are not pooled with others and the fund owns the allocation the shareholders of the fund are pooled ian mathers on march   at  pm so there is no significant difference from an etf like cef or a pool account like kitco offers the launch of this fund is a nonevent if you don’t have it in your hand you don’t really own it ron rowland on march   at  pm correct no siginificant difference
