rattled shipping industry investors does this increase the risk of holding textainer stock asit sharma tmffinosus sep   at pm image source getty images given the turbulence in the shipping business brought by hanjin shippings recently declared bankruptcy its natural that investors in textainer group holdings ltd nysetgh would worry about the risk in the container companys shares the shipper does indeed do business with hanjin after filling in some overall context around textainer ill analyze its exposure to hanjin as we try to determine just how precarious the container lessors shares are at present state of the industry and recent textainer earnings its important to understand at the outset that an investment in the container shipping subsector carries earnings risk for the very near future a report by moodys investors service in june extended a negative outlook on the global shipping industry for another  to  months according to the report container shipping companies are especially at risk of posting lower ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization due to the conflict between ample new container supply and lower demand since owning and leasing shipping containers is textainers primary line of business its not surprising that lower lease rates for new containers drove an  decline in revenue in the second quarter of  revealed when the company released earnings on aug  yet shareholders were taken aback by a net loss of  million versus net income of  million in q  a sizable chunk of the profit decline between comparable quarters arose from a  million impairment charge on used container inventory held for sale and disposal management pointed to weak rates for used containers as its motivation to be proactive and write down the inventory in part to maintain a reasonable utilization of existing containers even before the secondquarter report textainers immediate prospects werent very robust i had the chance recently to crunch a few vital textainer metrics in an analysis comparing the company to fellow shipping industry corporation frontline my opinion at the time was that frontline constituted the better buy due to a balance sheet encumbered with less debt which offered a better margin of safety to the investor you can see that headtohead comparison here the metrics i used will serve decently to illustrate textainers position two quarters into  after we add another updated column the july  calculations pull from textainers firstquarter data while todays article uses information from the second quarter metric ttm revenue

negatively impacted many of the metrics above highlighting increased risk in the companys operations and by extension its stock in particular pay attention to the deterioration in the current ratio tracking a companys ability to cover current obligations with current assets from  to a much lower though admittedly stillhealthy reading of  in addition times interest earned which measures the degree to which a company can cover its debt service declined significantly during the quarter  these two metrics point to a slight bit of liquidity and solvency pressure and explain why management slashed textainers quarterly dividend payment to  per share winnowing a morethangenerous  yield all the way down to  this may not be a happy circumstance for shareholders but on the other hand its a pragmatic decision given decelerating revenue and a high proportion of debt to equity on the balance sheet hanjin exposure hanjin shipping filed for protection from creditors in its home country of south korea on aug  and in the us on sept   on sept  textainer released a onepage update for investors on the bankruptcy as of sept  roughly  of textainers owned fleet in footequivalent units teu was leased to hanjin textainer disclosed that it may incur significant costs from the hanjin bankruptcy even if the troubled company resumes shipping specifically textainer cited that a portion or all if its hanjin receivables may be deemed uncollectible in addition significant costs may be incurred in recovering repairing repositioning and releasing those containers leased to hanjin and the rates achieved for released containers may be substantially below the lease rates paid by hanjin surprisingly though it can quantify the percentage of its container fleet affected by hanjin textainer ended its press release with the following simple statement at this time textainer is unable to quantify the financial impact related to hanjins recent filings this my friends is a projection of more than mild uncertainty and with heightened uncertainty comes increased risk if textainer can quantify the amount of its fleet leased out to hanjin why cant it go ahead and calculate and disclose at least a wide range of potential financial impact i suspect that the situation is a bit more complex than writing off receivables guessing at lost lease revenue and projecting container releasing costs this is because textainers revolving credit facilities and secured debt facilities are collateralized by its owned containers removing some or all of the hanjin containers from eligible collateral schedules held by creditors could impact the companys financing cost debt covenants or both until more clarity emerges from hanjins receivership proceeding it may be difficult to assess impacts on textainers borrowing base let me put this another way it would be constructive for management to address as soon as possible whether the containers leased to hanjin affect the companys position visavis its secured creditors until then its prudent to exercise caution around shares textainer already exhibits some strain on its balance sheet in the form of significant debt hanjins receivership crisis and a lack of clarity on how this might effect textainers credit has pushed the stocks risk  for now at least  beyond the zone of the comfortable asit sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned the
