dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available   our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the plan of operation section of this prospectus as of november   we generated  in revenues had  in cash and liabilities of  the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us

offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business we are company with limited operations have incurred expenses and have losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on august   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the marketing of software development business and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our products and services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of softwared development services is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected   page some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our sole officer and director will own more than  of our outstanding common stock he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders mr zausaev our sole officer and director will own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr zausaev may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company currently we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director we depend entirely on aleksandr zausaev for all of our operations the loss of mr zausaev would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail mr zausaev has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of mr zausaevs services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future   page our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company aleksandr zausaev our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   page risks associated with this offering because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on august   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan the regulation of penny stocks by the sec and finra may discourage the tradability of the companys securities   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all our president mr zausaev does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities  and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr zausaev does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities   page the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between zartex inc and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   the estimated cost of this registration statement is  which will be paid from offering proceeds if the offering proceeds are less than registration cost we will have to utilize funds from aleksandr zausaev our sole officer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process mr zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an sec reporting obligation we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board the companys investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of shares for various considerations in the future our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are currently issued and outstanding if we sell the  shares being offered in this offering we would have  shares issued and outstanding as discussed in the dilution section below the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   page forward looking

paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by mr zausaev mr zausaev will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation determination of offering price   the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder the historical net tangible book value as of november   was  or  per share historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of november

materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to        have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act    provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of

certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   page we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   we had  in cash as of november   we believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may utilize funds from aleksandr zausaev our chairman and president who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees as of november   mr zausaev has advanced to us  mr zausaev however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering being a development stage company we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing our principal executive offices are located at  south pecos rd suite  las vegas nv  our phone number is   we are a development stage company to date we signed two agreements and generetaed  of revenue as a result of these agreements our operating expenses for the three months ended november   were  we have sold our match me software on november   and on november   accordingly our product and service includes match me ecatalog software for clients retailer stores maintenance and technical support there were no direct costs for software development our president and director aleksandr zausaev was responsible for the software developed and spent his time only for software coding software designing and software implementation our full business plan entails activities described in the plan of operation section below long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business the exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion we do not currently have planned our expansion and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing if we do not generate sufficient revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our plan of operation below to maintain a reporting status our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated significant revenues and no additional revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year and would have to obtain additional funding plan of operation we were incorporated in the state of nevada on august   we have never declared bankruptcy have never been in receivership and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings since incorporation we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets we are a development stage company that has not generated sufficient revenue and just recently started our operations if we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering we are a company at the stage of the development but we plan to employ modern technologies to attract our customers by gaining interest to their offers through our web catalogue to successfully complete several stages we might apply to the third parties who we believe perform the jobs needed in a more professional way that we could do it ourselves we expect to be of interest to garment buyers as we do not plan to charge them instead we expect to charge the retailers who wish to be listed in the catalogue with their offers by which we mean the range of items the prices and special offers such as season discounts limited editions of clothing collections we also plan to offer our customers to combine their offers that users see in the web catalogue into an automatically generated pdf catalogue based on the users request to be downloaded by the users for offline use we intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business we do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees   page our plan of operations is as follows complete our public offering we expect to complete our public offering within  days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the securities and exchange commissions we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand upon completion of our public offering our specific goal is to profitably sell our services if we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately  if  of the shares sold our business may fail our plan of operations following the completion is as follows office leasing time frame stth months min costs  we are leasing the office at  south pecos rd suite  las vegas nv  since september   we expect that our yearly leasing fees will be approximately  office establishing and equipmnet time frame std months costs  as a company involved mostly in software production we do not require large office spaces in fact if it turns more profitable we may rent or obtain several small offices possibly remote from each other because our staff can interact via the internet in this case each office has to be equipped accordingly to the needs of the department in other case the office has to be equipped as follows our basic needs are two computers for the director and the customers support manager connected to the internet a phone a fax printer scanner basic furniture basic stationery our data of the web catalogue and match me engine are likely to be stored on a rented web server of a third party which is less desirable as we will have limited control of the server in case of urgent maintenance all the mentioned above we may obtain in case we sell  shares in case we succeed in selling  of shares we additionally can obtain a server to store and to process the web catalogue data in case the amount of data increases we probably might obtain additional hard drive disks for the server or rent a third partys server depending on what turns more efficient in case we succeed in selling  of shares we may possess an office with space enough for all staff including the conference room to conduct staff meetings or presentations for customers rooms with the space for the servers additional equipment for the servers rails to hold hard disks hdds and other order to have a chatting bot for telegram viber whatsapp messengers which may help our clients customers stay informed about the updates of the catalogue in case we sell  of the shares issued we plan to buy only one pc for our director it will cost us approximately  website development time frame stth months costs  as our software is build to sustain the needs of the website holding the web catalogue our website is one of our primary investments to be attractive for users and show better user oriented performance it has to come as a fully functional website with all our software features employed in case we succeed only in selling  share we probably design a landing page to demonstrate the features of the catalogue the landing page will be connected to the official retailers pages which is less desirable as it may steer away the customers from our project as match me feature will not be able to operate within the limitations of the landing page in case we sell  of share we might possess a simple website with the web catalogue fully operating on redirecting customers to the official retailers page only in case of payment by proceeding with pay on the official site button we also plan to mount the match me feature on the website this sum looks insufficient to invest into the mobile application as the application requires crossplatform adaptation in order to show the same result on all mobile devices as the mobile application is expected to employ the rule of perspective algorithm which also requires tweaking for different devices so in this case we may choose to invest into a better website design with a proper user interface in case we sell  we can come up with a fullyfunctional website with all the features performing without limitations where customers can choose and order from any retailers online outlet or real outlet it also makes investing in our mobile application possible which means not only programming the algorithms but designing the friendly users interface as well marketing campaign time frame stth months costs  we plan to advertise our services on the world wide web as we are the company which was established to deliver software for the purposes of online use world web also gives the impression of a bigger advertizing space with many users who may turn our potential customers we plan to begin our advertising campaign once we manage to design the website performing as planned with at least the web catalogue feature in case we sell only  of shares we may be able only to buy small advertising spaces for web banners on popular websites offering garment of various brands such as amazon or etsy etc in order to get better publicity with at least  of shares sold we may be able to advertise our web catalogue via social networks by employing a content writer whose duty is to describe the competitive advantages of our website we expect it also to attract people interested in buying garment with the help of innovation we offer thus attracting our potential customers with their clients already attracted to make larger publicity and expand into related markets to attract customers from other industries we need to have  shares sold we see this sum as sufficient to advertise duly with larger target audience reached to carry out our advertising campaign successfully we plan to  improve seo search engine optimization in order to be exposed in the search inquiries of different search engines such as google bing and yandex we expect that this optimization might result in attracting customers from across the world  improve our smm performance social media marketing by hiring content writers and administrators for our social web pages we plan to share the information concerning our project the features of our web catalogue and additional services to have our customers and broad public interested in our offers  be exposed to garment industry by taking part in fashion events or events specifically for garment retailers where we expect to demonstrate the performance of our match me engine and the match me box and explain the beneficial of installing this equipment in the stores and explain the beneficial sides of our web catalogue  additionally if we find it efficient we may spend on advertisements in printed periodicals for entrepreneurs focusing on garment retailers as well as invest in video advertisements which may appear both on tv or on the internet in case we sell  of the shares issued we plan to to spend approximately  for the marketing campaign employees time frame stth months costs  as a software company we do not require large staff because our main focus is to build the program and the website for it in case we manage to sell  of shares we expect director to manage the main workload in case we manage to sell  of shares the director keeps the duties of programming and a customers support manager keeps in contact with our customers and the functions of the sales agent with the duty to find customers in this case we might order the website users interface design from a freelancer though freelancer are notorious for often failing to keep deadlines or perform duly in case of  of shares sold we expect to employ additional staff to maintain the servers and the website performance a sales manager to search for the customers and issue contracts with them  we would like several jobs to be performed by third parties such as the work on designing of the website we expect the website from a professional designing agency to give us more professional look of a reliable company we also might employ third parties such as photographers to take photos of the garment pieces our customers wish to display on the website models to demonstrate clothes   page estimated expenses for the next twelve month period    the following provides an overview

to reserve the items chosen in the most convenient outlet with the most reasonable price to the users mind our software has programming engine which can be used many times for our customers we sell the softfare and the service of software customization for every potential client the software can not be used separately from software customization because of garment retailers have their individual products prices servisec etc our software is an application which can be used in our customers webcatalogs or on any supported devices we retain the rights to use our software with to use the match me software and its feature in our future product offerings we plan the website operating on our software to possess the following main options   different viewing options a gallery with big or small thumbnail photos   an option to select clothes or put it onto a hold which automatically reserves the same piece of clothes in the store where the user plans to receive it   combine several orders to see how they match   pay directly to the retailer beforehand through a payment form or choose to pay upon receiving the order   sort items by the brand names prices nearest stores in order to gain our customers awareness we come to the market with highly adaptive web engine which might be tweaked to the needs of the end user we expect that coding a mobile application might give our software wider popularity among customers the mobile application might be used as both a mobile version of the web catalogue and a measuring device the mobile application will use the algorithm of the rule of perspective to compare clothing sizes on the store to those of the customers provided that a customer takes a photo of a real size object adjusts it to fit the marked frame in the application it displays if the chosen garment can fit the customer our application users may also enable match me feature which we plan to deliver within the application match me is expected to use the algorithm of analyzing the data provided by user in order to make lists of clothing styles with actual items from the stores that we plan to partner up with and the information concerning the price the brand the store to be on display it is quite obvious that people stick to a clothing style due to the preferences in music for instance rock listeners are likely to wear leather movies some people might copy the styles of the favorite actors in certain films healthstyle people involved in yoga might prefer natural materials to synthetic ones and other preferences enabling match me feature a user goes through a simple multiple choice questionnaire including the questions about the preferences actual season and mood in order to receive the possible clothing combinations   page the engine of our web catalogue is supposed to be built in the way that it displays garment items regardless the brand awareness which may help small brands and individual designers to make their way to general public we expect that our program can also inspire the competition between retailers which may result in a number of various offers for clothing buyers thus helping us to receive awareness and to involve as many retailers in our project as possible provided that retailers show their interest in our program we may come to a certain retailers outlet with an additional item  match me box a computerized installment we plan to configure the match me box in a similar way that match me feature of the application works this match me box is schemed to be installed in shopping centres for the

have not earned significant revenue it is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding the software we are about to market has to undergo the following process  the initial stage of general planning in other words realizing the structure outlining the user interface gathering the concept of the program core to follow estimating the amount of work to be performed and its direction all the mentioned above are likely to be performed solely by the director who he will retain all the copyright of the software  the development stage which involves coding of the software itself and designing the user interface in case funds are sufficient to employ additional staff as contractors to perform coding as planned under mr zausaevs supervision we are likely to do so the contractors will be credited for their job but all the rights will belong to mr zausaev which we are about to mention in the contract as for the users interface ui development it is likely to be outsourced to a thirdparty company in case if we have a sufficient sum to do so  according to mr zausaevs guidelines and modern trends we expect the third party to design only the elements of the ui such as icons menu bars additional bars login screens error screens buttons etc we plan to issue a contract reserving us the right to use the mentioned interface for the commercial purposes with the third partys name to be credited as the ui developer for the software owned by mr zausaev  the marketing stage which involves selling the

defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse   page the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction

rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the

prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business because our auditors have raised a going concern there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available   our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the plan of operation section of this prospectus as of october   we had  in cash and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from aleksandr zausaev our sole officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr zausaev has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing     page if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business we are company with limited operations have incurred expenses and have losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on august   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the marketing of software development business and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our products and services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of softwared development services is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected   page some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our sole officer and director will own more than  of our outstanding common stock he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders mr zausaev our sole officer and director will own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr zausaev may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company currently we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director we depend entirely on aleksandr zausaev for all of our operations the loss of mr zausaev would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail mr zausaev has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of mr zausaevs services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future   page because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations aleksandr zausaev our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations he will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company aleksandr zausaev our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   page risks associated with this offering because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on august   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have

broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all our president mr zausaev does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities  and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr zausaev does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the

understandings between zartex inc and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance

the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   page forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking

determination of offering price   the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder the historical net tangible book value as of august   was negative  or  per share historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of october   the following table sets forth as of august   the

the risk factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to        have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act    provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting      comply with any

private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   page we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   we had  in cash as of october   we believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may utilize funds from aleksandr zausaev our chairman and president who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees as of august   mr zausaev has advanced to us  mr zausaev however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering being a development stage company we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing our principal executive offices are located at  south pecos rd suite  las vegas nv  our phone number is   we are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date our full business plan entails activities described in the plan of operation section below long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business the exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion we do not currently have planned our expansion and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our plan of operation below to maintain a reporting status our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year and would have to obtain additional funding plan of operation we were incorporated in the state of nevada on august   we have never declared bankruptcy have never been in receivership and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings since incorporation we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets we are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations if we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering we are a company at the stage of the development but we plan to employ modern technologies to attract our customers by gaining interest to their offers through our web catalogue to successfully complete several stages we might apply to the third parties who we believe perform the jobs needed in a more professional way that we could do it ourselves we expect to be of interest to garment buyers as we do not plan to charge them instead we expect to charge the retailers who wish to be listed in the catalogue with their offers by which we mean the range of items the prices and special offers such as season discounts limited editions of clothing collections we also plan to offer our customers to combine their offers that users see in the web catalogue into an automatically generated pdf catalogue based on the users request to be downloaded by the users for offline use we intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business we do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees   page our plan of operations is as follows complete our public offering we expect to complete our public offering within  days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the securities and exchange commissions we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand upon completion of our public offering our specific goal is to profitably sell our services if we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately  if  of the shares sold our business may fail our plan of operations following the completion is as follows office leasing time frame stth months min costs  we are leasing the office at  south pecos rd suite  las vegas nv  since september   our yearly leasing fees are approximately  office establishing and equipmnet time frame std months costs  as a company involved mostly in software production we do not require large office spaces in fact if it turns more profitable we may rent or obtain several small offices possibly remote from each other because our staff can interact via the internet in this case each office has to be equipped accordingly to the needs of the department in other case the office has to be equipped as follows our basic needs are two computers for the director and the customers support manager connected to the internet a phone a fax printer scanner basic furniture basic stationery our data of the web catalogue and match me engine are likely to be stored on a rented web server of a third party which is less desirable as we will have limited control of the server in case of urgent maintenance all the mentioned above we may obtain in case we sell  shares in case we succeed in selling  of shares we additionally can obtain a server to store and to process the web catalogue data in case the amount of data increases we probably might obtain additional hard drive disks for the server or rent a third partys server depending on what turns more efficient in case we succeed in selling  of shares we may possess an office with space enough for all staff including the conference room to conduct staff meetings or presentations for customers rooms with the space for the servers additional equipment for the servers rails to hold hard disks hdds and other order to have a chatting bot for telegram viber whatsapp messengers which may help our clients customers stay informed about the updates of the catalogue website development time frame stth months costs  as our software is build to sustain the needs of the website holding the web catalogue our website is one of our primary investments to be attractive for users and show better user oriented performance it has to come as a fully functional website with all our software features employed in case we succeed only in selling  share we probably design a landing page to demonstrate the features of the catalogue the landing page will be connected to the official retailers pages which is less desirable as it may steer away the customers from our project as match me feature will not be able to operate within the limitations of the landing page in case we sell  of share we might possess a simple website with the web catalogue fully operating on redirecting customers to the official retailers page only in case of payment by proceeding with pay on the official site button we also plan to mount the match me feature on the website this sum looks insufficient to invest into the mobile application as the application requires crossplatform adaptation in order to show the same result on all mobile devices as the mobile application is expected to employ the rule of perspective algorithm which also requires tweaking for different devices so in this case we may choose to invest into a better website design with a proper user interface in case we sell  we can come up with a fullyfunctional website with all the features performing without limitations where customers can choose and order from any retailers online outlet or real outlet it also makes investing in our mobile application possible which means not only programming the algorithms but designing the friendly users interface as well marketing campaign time frame stth months costs  we plan to advertise our services on the world wide web as we are the company which was established to deliver software for the purposes of online use world web also gives the impression of a bigger advertizing space with many users who may turn our potential customers we plan to begin our advertising campaign once we manage to design the website performing as planned with at least the web catalogue feature in case we sell only  of shares we may be able only to buy small advertising spaces for web banners on popular websites offering garment of various brands such as amazon or etsy etc in order to get better publicity with at least  of shares sold we may be able to advertise our web catalogue via social networks by employing a content writer whose duty is to describe the competitive advantages of our website we expect it also to attract people interested in buying garment with the help of innovation we offer thus attracting our potential customers with their clients already attracted to make larger publicity and expand into related markets to attract customers from other industries we need to have  shares sold we see this sum as sufficient to advertise duly with larger target audience reached to carry out our advertising campaign successfully we plan to  improve seo search engine optimization in order to be exposed in the search inquiries of different search engines such as google bing and yandex we expect that this optimization might result in attracting customers from across the world  improve our smm performance social media marketing by hiring content writers and administrators for our social web pages we plan to share the information concerning our project the features of our web catalogue and additional services to have our customers and broad public interested in our offers  be exposed to garment industry by taking part in fashion events or events specifically for garment retailers where we expect to demonstrate the performance of our match me engine and the match me box and explain the beneficial of installing this equipment in the stores and explain the beneficial sides of our web catalogue  additionally if we find it efficient we may spend on advertisements in printed periodicals for entrepreneurs focusing on garment retailers as well as invest in video advertisements which may appear both on tv or on the internet employees time frame stth months costs  as a software company we do not require large staff because our main focus is to build the program and the website for it in case we manage to sell  of shares we expect director to manage the main workload in case we manage to sell  of shares the director keeps the duties of programming and a customers support manager keeps in contact with our customers and the functions of the sales agent with the duty to find customers in this case we might order the website users interface design from a freelancer though freelancer are notorious for often failing to keep deadlines or perform duly in case of  of shares sold we expect to employ additional staff to maintain the servers and the website performance a sales manager to search for the customers and issue contracts with them  we would like several jobs to be performed by third parties such as the work on designing of the website we expect the website from a professional designing agency to give us more professional look of a reliable company we also might employ third parties such as photographers to take photos of the garment pieces our customers wish to display on the website models to demonstrate

our auditors have issued a going concern opinion meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in

procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements especially that of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  this additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations should the company fail to raise a minimum of  under this offering the company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its month plan of operations description of business   we are a software company that seeks to deliver services for garment distribution industry our main service is the it product for garment retailers we plan to deliver a software product to which we may refer as a program a webengine or an application the visible part of which we plan to design in a form of a web catalogue with many offers in the garment industry producers and retailers might experience difficulties in delivering their offer to their potential customers customers might feel insecure about how their actual size matches to the size of clothing displayed on the retailers or producers website we expect that employment of our program can make it easier to advertize and sell garment items for retailers select and buy for garment buyers our main customers are online and real stores involved in clothing distribution to whom we plan to sell our software and customize precisely to their needs the users of the application who are the retailers customers are our indirect customers whom we do not charge for using the software we plan to deliver our software together with the buyers aligned website which holds a catalogue of various brands clothing items listed in it for the users our application within the website will perform only informing functions with the possibility to reserve the items chosen in the most convenient outlet with the most reasonable price to the users mind we plan the website operating on our software to possess the following main options   different viewing options a gallery with big or small thumbnail photos   an option to select clothes or put it onto a hold which automatically reserves the same piece of clothes in the store where the user plans to receive it   combine several orders to see how they match   pay directly to the retailer beforehand through a payment form or choose to pay upon receiving the order   sort items by the brand names prices nearest stores in order to gain our customers awareness we plan to come to the market with highly adaptive web engine which might be tweaked to the needs of the end user we expect that coding a mobile application might give our software wider popularity among customers the mobile application might be used as both a mobile version of the web catalogue and a measuring device the mobile application will use the algorithm of the rule of perspective to compare clothing sizes on the store to those of the customers provided that a customer takes a photo of a real size object adjusts it to fit the marked frame in the application it displays if the chosen garment can fit the customer our application users may also enable match me feature which we plan to deliver within the application match me is expected to use the algorithm of analyzing the data provided by user in order to make lists of clothing styles with actual items from the stores that we plan to partner up with and the information concerning the price the brand the store to be on display it is quite obvious that people stick to a clothing style due to the preferences in music for instance rock listeners are likely to wear leather movies some people might copy the styles of the favorite actors in certain films healthstyle people involved in yoga might prefer natural materials to synthetic ones and other preferences enabling match me feature a user goes through a simple multiple choice questionnaire including the questions about the preferences actual season and mood in order to receive the possible clothing combinations   page the engine of our web catalogue is supposed to be built in the way that it displays garment items regardless the
