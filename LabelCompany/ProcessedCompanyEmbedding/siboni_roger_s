rights reserved epiphany ceo tells all  apr     small business epiphany ceo tells all april    pm et he leads his young software firm into battle against oracle and siebel systems by kim cross new york cnnfn  it is  am on a rainy january day and epiphany ceo roger siboni is getting fired up in the back seat of a lincoln town car the stock market opens in an hour on his way to live tv interviews he is bracing himself for wall streets reaction to his companys fourthquarter earnings as the car whizzes through san franciscos slick city streets his investor relations and public relations directors are twisted around in their seats grilling him with mock press questions unfazed siboni articulates in raspy sound bites as he nurses his second cup of coffee it has been a good year for epiphany epny research estimates and not many companies can make that claim sibonis company creates software that helps businesses interact with customers and it has seen sales increase more than fivefold in  to  million by the end of the year its fourthquarter loss was down to  cents per share beating analysts targets and the company landed more than  new customers most of them big old economy stalwarts epiphany counts as clients about  percent of the top  us companies minutes later siboni delivers that news on camera epiphany he says is right on track to be profitable by the end of the year and he expects to grow revenue by  percent wall street smiles analysts gush congratulations and the stock ticks up  percent to  rebounding from a low of  earlier in the month were not a startup anymore he says later were a grownup not just yet though epiphany has made a name for itself by pulling ahead of scores of companies that just a few months ago crowded the  billion market for customer relationship management crm software siboni has a daunting task ahead if he intends to live up to his promises he will have to beat out database software titan oracle orcl research estimates and others to reach his goal of becoming no  in crm tougher still he must take on industry leader siebel systems sebl research estimates a colossus sporting a  billion market capitalization leading a yearold company into battle against siebel and oracle is a pretty tall order whats more the charge comes at a time when the longterm demand for  and the bottomline benefit of  crm software is still unproven but thanks to a career spent climbing his way to the top and networking feverishly many say siboni is just the man for the job if i had to put my money with someone says jon madonna president of elearning firm digitalthink and former ceo and chairman of accounting firm kpmg it would be roger siboni no rookie not long after epiphany was founded in  founders steve blank ben wegbreit john mccaskey and greg walsh went in search of the right person to nurture their technology into the next great enterprise software company so they called john doerr a partner in the venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield  byers whose connections in silicon valley are legend doerr knew siboni was the right candidate for the job the difficult part would be persuading siboni to leave his post as deputy chairman at kpmg the big five firm where he spent  years building other companies he shot up the corporate ranks there working in the accounting tax finance and mergers and acquisitions departments until becoming at age  one of the youngest partners in the firms history those years spent dissecting companies from every angle gave siboni a deep understanding of how a business should run which was exactly the quality the epiphany founders were looking for in a ceo it took a lot of convincing several times in the past siboni had said no when doerr tried to persuade him to lead startups i turned him down at least a dozen times siboni recalls in may  after three months of onesided negotiations siboni signed on with epiphany to this day im not sure why i said yes he says i told my wife im going to go upstairs and call them and say no and somehow i said yes a wild ride nearly three years later siboni is settled into his office in san mateo calif a small spartan room with an immaculately paperless desk im a little obsessivecompulsive he says with a shrug as he straightens a few awards arranged on a table and then attempts to read and answer every email the sole wall decor is a postersize plaque bearing the companys  core values see epiphanys secret sauce its a far cry from the plush park avenue offices of kpmg but siboni hasnt looked back i certainly dont regret it he says its easy to see why he doesnt life at epiphany has been a wild ride full of irrational exuberance and moments of despair he says the company pulled off a highflying initial public offering in  raising  million in january  a very timely secondary public offering pumped in another  million in cash more than enough to survive the imminent april crash like other ceos siboni is focusing on turning a profit and that means acquiring more customers while containing costs he has created strict internal buying procedures to shrink procurement costs he says he will continue to forgo the expensive marketing blitzes that came back to bite most dotcoms last year he will rely instead on customer recommendations and industry buzz to attract new customers that method worked last year when epiphany spent about  on targeted advertising campaigns while other firms burned millions sibonis mantra small office big house if we watch our pennies our dollars will take care of themselves he tells his staff urging them to spend wisely in consideration of the bottom line no hypocrite he winces at his morning ride in the lincoln town car hired for the purpose of this interview he cringes at the unnecessary expense of the hot buffet at epiphanys quarterly town hall meeting where he rallies more than  employees we have to become profitable by yearend we absolutely have to and wellheeled though he may be with nearly a  million stake in epiphany siboni has his shoes resoled ecosystem of data siboni describes epiphanys technology as an ecosystem of data about customers the software culls information from all the touch points where companies interact with customers from call centers websites email or web chat the idea is that if companies can better understand customers they can better serve them by providing individually tailored offers or promotions and more insightful customer service imagine a call center rep who knows you bought snow skis last year at a physical branch that you searched for poles on the website last week and offers you one promotion  a sale on ski racks  when you call initially focused on analytics which help make sense of customer data the company added call center software through its  billion acquisition of octane software and personalization tools through a purchase of rightpoint for  million    roger siboni       title ceo epiphany age  home san francisco status married three daughters r�sum� former deputy chairman kpmg hobbies avid collector of colonial currency     though epiphanys technology is designed for the web it is not intended only for dotcoms in fact epiphany has gone after the top  companies right from the start procter  gamble daimlerchrysler dcx research estimates american airlines and wells fargo rank among the companys  customers who average an initial deal size of  we knew where the money was siboni says when he did bother with dotcoms and technology companies he went after the big dogs amazoncom amzn research estimates cisco systems csco research estimates microsoft msft research estimates hewlettpackard hwp research estimates and other blue chips epiphanys technology helps customers such as nissan north america analyze web surfers clickstreams clickstream analysis highlights users most likely to make purchases and provides information nissan marketers need to create targeted campaigns epiphanys software also helps produce sales leads for nissans infiniti dealers who can access the data from wireless devices at  dealerships across the country nissan saw sales rates jump to as high as  percent after campaigns and generated thousands of incremental sales an astonishing return on investment of  percent on the cost of each campaign the first two major campaigns more than paid for the cost of the software and implementation says ted ross former corporate manager of crm at nissan north america who is now vice president of automotive crm solutions at iloft we generated millions on a campaign connections connections at kpmg siboni established many key relationships both inside the firm and at client companies these relationships make up the web that links nearly every customer executive and partner to epiphany its the power of the rolodex says karen richardson epiphanys general manager for north america she left her post as head of sales for netscape communications to join epiphany i wouldnt have come if i hadnt known who the ceo was she says sibonis kieretsu in silicon valley has cemented his status as a goto guy kpmg partners approach him for business advice he sits on the boards of directors of several companies as well as the university of california at berkeleys haas school of business and when he asks for help folks tend to respond one day in january he called the cfo of jc penney and left a message asking for a favor though they hadnt spoken in five years donald mckay  on the day of his retirement  returned sibonis call in a matter of minutes some of sibonis relationships have turned from collegial to competitive but he still tends them with cautious respect he remembers a time at kpmg when he consulted with pehong chen and tom siebel on a company called gain technology when they sold the company he helped each of them build new ventures that eventually became broadvision and siebel to this day siboni considers chen a friend and siebel a worthy nemesis tough road ahead that nemesis is perhaps the biggest challenge siboni will face in the coming year bigger even than expectations on wall street and a market unsure of the value of crm says charles phillips a managing director for morgan stanley dean witter mwd research estimates though siebels forte is in salesforce automation and software for call centers a much broader scope than epiphanys siebel which has  billion in sales has a serious lead in the crm market we spend more money developing our product than epiphany and other competitor kana communications make in combined revenues says andrew zoldan vice president of internet applications for siebel siebel is so far ahead in market share that purchasing its products is viewed as a safe decision like buying from microsoft says bob chatham a principal analyst for forrester research forr research estimates and siebel knows it for the most part siboni says siebel wont even acknowledge us as a competitor not so with oracle another big player in the market ceo larry ellison has spotted epiphany gaining ground and he does not like it in a speech at a trade show last year he bluntly stated his plans to put epiphany among others out of business other competitors include peoplesoft psft research estimates through an acquisition of vantive and nortel networks nt research estimates which bought clarify siboni takes siebels snubs and oracles trash talk as backhanded compliments everybody needs an enemy he says and he plans to take those enemies headon some analysts say the next step for epiphany is to add an application for salesforce automation that would mean stepping into siebels direct line of fireand into its more than  percent of the market it wont be easy says forresters chatham theres no one that epiphany could acquire that would give them enough enterpriseclass salespeople to catch siebel siboni hints that he might have something else up his sleeve the world does not need another traditional salesforce application he says epiphanys next move creating a product generations ahead of what siebel offers it would give a salesperson access to vast amounts of customer and marketing data all on a mobile device small office big house after a hour day at the office having consumed nothing but coffee and diet root beer siboni plops down in the sitting room of his home in san franciscos presidio heights neighborhood and sips fizzy water his motto small office big house rings true  its a big house in san francisco terms though lacking the opulence one might expect from a multimillionaire his wife joan pours a glass of chardonnay for their guests digitalthinks madonna and his wife though hes sticking to water siboni mellows as he jokes with madonna who was sibonis mentor at kpmg and who is now a close friend the two recall comical stories of mutual colleagues and industry bigwigs it soon becomes clear that the nexus of sibonis life and business is the very thing his software aims to promote its all about relationships epiphanys secret sauce displayed in most rooms at epiphany is a plaque inscribed with  core values that serve as the companys moral compass these values reprinted here verbatim are the key attributes of what epiphany employees voted internally to be the worlds best companies employees are evaluated annually based on adherence to

httpwwwsfgatecombusinessarticleanepiphanybringsformertopkpmgexectophp an epiphany brings former top kpmg exec to silicon valley  roger siboni trades trappings of power for startup equity tom abate published  am thursday july   a chauffeur used to drive roger siboni from his new jersey home each morning to his midmanhattan office where he worked as chief operating officer of the prestigious kpmg accounting firm nowadays siboni is driving himself around silicon valley chalk it up to the fact that at age  siboni reached an epiphany  thats the name of the palo alto software firm he joins this month as chairman and chief executive im trading salary and the trappings of power for equity siboni said epiphany sells a  software package that can extract customer information from any database and pour it into a web browser the idea is to let marketing people spot occasional customers and turn them into big spenders latest business videos using software to pump up sales is a top priority for corporations like charles schwab corp which has been using epiphany since november theres nothing on the market that im aware of that is as powerful and as easy to use and is also webaccessible said mary kelley vice president for database marketing at schwab credit for making epiphany powerful and simple goes to co founders ben wegbreit and steve blank and lead programmers greg walsh and john mccaskey now its up to siboni to sell this startup to the fortune  by drawing on personal relationships built up during two decades as a highprofile kpmg consultant siboni is no stranger to the valley he started kpmgs high tech consulting practice in  advising ancient firms such as wordstar last year while coo at kpmg siboni took sides in the browser wars when he handed a huge contract to microsoft despite a personal sales pitch from netscape ceo jim barksdale over lunch in palo alto siboni said hes run into barksdale since then and their cordial exchange convinced him that the netscape ceo hasnt held a grudge in fact barksdales such a big man he probably doesnt mind that epiphany just hired karen richardson as its vice president of sales luring her away from a similar post at netscape after all its only business in the fast lane  conspicuous absence house speaker newt gingrich led a delegation of congressional republicans on a meetandgreet tour of silicon valley this week but local representative tom campbell rcampbell was not a member of his party could it be the hometowner was snubbed because he was on the losing side of last summers attempted republican coup against the speaker whatever the cause campbell finds himself temporarily frozen out of the gops effort to make sure vice president al gore doesnt walk away with silicon valley votes  or money we want to pay more attention here and ask in return for more attention to be paid to us said representative bob goodlatte rva who accompanied gingrich goodlatte who has spearheaded encryption legislation favored by hightech firms was tapped by gingrich to head a new technology leadership group that will bring republicans in congress together with industry leaders like cisco vice president judy estrin merrill lynch investment banker scott ryles and kleiner perkins venture capitalist floyd kvamme  aols slippery slope last week america online shut down the web site of a member who had parodied several
