diagnostic tool that combines controlled patient movement during fluoroscopic imaging with advanced image processing and motion analysis one straightforward vma test provides both spinal instability and sagittal alignment measurements   why sagittal alignment previously only considered for deformity surgical procedures new literature suggests the clinical importance of sagittal alignment in even shortsegment lumbar fusion   our results indicate that surgeons should pay attention to sagittal spinopelvic alignment and avoid postoperative pi‑ll mismatch even when treating patients with shortsegment lumbar interbody fusion—aoki et al  pill mismatch brings the deformity world into the degenerative lumbar spine —rothenfluh et al    significance of pill mismatch researchers have proposed that sagittal balance occurs when pelvic incidence pi matches lumbar lordosis ll the difference is referred to as pi‑ll mismatch recentlypublished studies of one and twolevel lumbar spinal fusion patients suggest that postop pi‑ll mismatch correlated with longterm clinical symptoms   sophisticated measurements with no extra steps vma automates the process for obtaining established spinopelvic alignment parameters from fluoroscopic images collected during vma testing pelvic incidence lumbar lordosis pelvic tilt and sacral slope are included in the vma report along with the assessment of spinal motion and instability vma provides a redlight alert when pill mismatch exceeds the physicianset threshold eg °   view sample vma lumbar sagittal alignment report   replacing an antiquated process with automated accuracy traditionally surgeons planning for deformity surgery have relied on longfilm x‑rays and complex geometric constructions to assess sagittal alignment parameters like pi‑ll mismatch vma reports provide convenient access to alignment measurement without these complicated manual steps     measurement matters recentlypublished studies have emphasized a direct correlation between sagittal alignment and both short and longterm clinical outcomes reliable spinal motion and alignment data support informed surgical decisions and provide potentially powerful patient consult tools with vma these insights can become a standard part of spinal fusion surgical planning     references terran j schwab f shaffrey ci smith js devos p ames cp fu km burton

starts blooming both your lawn and the plants and vegetation you have need plenty of water and sunlight which you and mother nature provide however your greenery needs a little help in the form of food fertilizer pest control and other treatments to keep everything growing and producing as much as it can with our low prices every day on everything in our garden center you can create a terrificlooking natural space for yourself your family and your friends without breaking the banklawn carein addition to frequent cutting edging trimming and other maintenance steps you do to maintain a healthy beautifullooking lawn you need to keep it fed and pest and weedfree if you have bare patches in your lawn spread some grass seed in the bare spots itll take just a few weeks for the new grass to fill in make sure youre using seed that matches the type of grass you have such as fescue or bermuda grasskeep your lawn fed properly by using fertilizer fertilizer comes in large bags from  pounds to  pounds and serves as the primary food for your lawn its recommended that you use a fertilizer spreader to apply fertilizer in an even pattern too much fertilizer in one spot can cause your grass to burn in direct sunlight choose a spreader thats suited for your lawn if you have an average to largesize lawn to maintain youll want to use a spreader that you push across your lawn that spreads the fertilizer out as you walk if you only have a small patch of grass to maintain such as at a condominium or apartment with a back yard choose either a handheld spreader or apply with a wand using liquid fertilizer there are even liquid fertilizers you can spray using your own water hose gardeningeven before you plant your first flower bulb vegetable bush or tree its important to prepare the soil the first step is to clear any weeds and old vegetation from the area where you plan to do your planting then its a good idea to enrich the soil with new garden soil or topsoil its also smart to use a ph level tester on the soil to make sure the ph levels are correct for the plants you wish to grow it might be necessary to add some lime or calcium to the soil until the nutrient balance is correctonce youve sown your seeds or planted your plants its necessary to keep them feed if you apply garden soil initially many brands have fertilizer mixed in with the soil which feeds your plants for a few weeks however as the plants and flowers mature it becomes necessary to feed them periodically a good way to take care of this is to attach a liquid fertilizer container to a water hose to disperse a measured amount of food to your plantsif you don t have a patch of land to grow plants there are many other options available such as planters vases and boxes if you don t have access to a water hose a watering can will deliver the water the plants needweed and plant controlif you have weeds popping up in your lawn or garden you want to remove them right away so they dont overrun your lawn vegetables or other plants in your garden its best to remove them by hand such as by using a garden shovel trowel or asparagus knife to dig beneath the roots of the weed and remove it completely any weeds that have roots remaining in the soil can regrow in time which means youll need to repeat the process again for lawns you can apply fertilizer to your grass that has weed killer mixed in allowing you to weed and feed your lawn that the same time for weeds that pop up individually on your lawn such as dandelions or crabgrass and for any weeds that grow between patio or sidewalk sections you can use a spot sprayer to kill them directly these usually kill the weeds within a few daysif you have garden pests such as ants or crawling insects that are eating or killing your plants there are options you can use to kill the pests without harming your vegetation a good example of this is diatomaceous earth which provides longlasting control against harmful insects its safe for pets and you can even use it inside your homeshow moreelectrode comp dcproddal envproda profprod ver shaabecbaddedacefc cid outdoor lighting  walmartcomskip to main contentmenusearchwalmart save money

patio setup means less time inside the house on nice days and a chance to show off your culinary skills even if its just for grilling hot dogs and hamburgers grills come in many assorted styles and we have several for you to consider gas grills and charcoal grills are the most common with electric grills also being an option there are also portable grills that you can use on a table or when youre out at the beach or park and smokers or pellet grills make it so you can slowroast meats and vegetables and add a lot of smoky flavor to themgas grills come in two forms propane and natural gas propane gas grills require a canister of propane to be attached but this allows these grills to be used anywhere in the backyard or even away from home natural gas grills require a hookup to the home and can only go as far as the gas line allows them charcoal grills use lighted charcoal briquettes to supply the heat gas grills allow you to control the flame better but some people prefer the taste that comes from cooking over charcoalportable grills can be either propane gas or charcoal smokers can also be all three although many use chunks of hardwood like pecan or mesquite to create the smoke that permeates whatever youre cooking pellet grills are also smoker grills but use pellets made from sawdust to create smoke with any kind of grill accessories are important this includes spatulas tongs sauce brushes or mops knives grill brushes forks and skewers you can purchase these items separately or choose one of our convenient sets that have all the pieces you need inside other accessories and supplies to consider include grill covers for protecting your grill against the elements chimney starters charcoal lighter fluid wood chunks and chips use with both charcoal grills and smokers grill cleaning tools stiff wire brushes that keep grill grates clean of burnt food turkey fryers large deep fryers for frying large cuts of meat outside refrigerators and ice makers for keeping food and beverages coldpatio and outdoor decorhaving some furniture and a grill on the patio is a terrific start however you may want to consider adding some homier touches to complete the scene a couple of planters or large pots with flowers is a nice touch or if youre doing a lot of cooking outside you may want to grow some fresh herbs outdoor lighting is also essential because you dont want to be forced to go inside once the sun sets options you have here include landscape and deck lights decorative lights that you connect to your home tiki torches colored bulbs on strands that you hang strategically around the patio or even flood lights other decorations you can add to brighten your patio area and backyard include bird baths bird feeders fountains garden statues
