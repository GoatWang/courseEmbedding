an integral part of these condensed unaudited financial statements            table of contents     me renewable power corporation formerly jarex solutions corp notes to the condensed financial statements   september     unaudited   note  – nature of operations   me renewable power corporation the company was incorporated in the state of nevada under the name jarex solutions corp on october   inception and originally intended to commence operations in the business of automatic number plate recognition “anpr’ software development for businesses which have parking zones or access control on their sites jarex solutions corp intended to develop software based on the anpr technologies in latvia   on june   the company merged with its whollyowned subsidiary me renewable power corporation a nevada corporation and changed its name from jarex solutions corp to me renewable power corporation the company now intends to distribute green energysaving and reusable equipment and materials   note   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and are presented in us dollars the company has adopted a december  fiscal year end   unaudited interim financial statements the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q accordingly the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements   in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for a the financial position b the result of operations and c cash flows have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading the results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year   while management of the company believes that the disclosures presented herein are adequate and not misleading these condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the year ended december     use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   prepaid expenses   prepaid expenses consist of prepaid filing fees prepaid expenses are amortized as the related expense is incurred            table of contents     basic income loss per share the company computes loss per share in accordance with “asc” “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations   basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive   for the nine month period ended to september   there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been antidilutive as the company incurred losses in this period   recent accounting pronouncements the company reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company   note  – going concern   the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future the company has incurred a loss since inception october   resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of september   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business accordingly there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors andor private placement of common stock   note  – related party transactions   in support of the company’s efforts and cash requirements it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing there is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders or directors amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities the advances were considered temporary in nature and were not formalized by a promissory note   during the nine months ended september   a previous shareholder forgave loans to the company in the amount of  the transaction was recorded to additional paid in capital   during the nine months ended september   the company was provided loans of  by a new shareholder   loans to shareholders at september   and december   were  and  respectively the advances are noninterest bearing due upon demand and unsecured   note  – income taxes   as of september   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts through  future tax benefits which arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carryforwards   note   subsequent events   the company has evaluated subsequent events from september   to the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no items to disclose            table of contents     item  managements discussion and analysis of
