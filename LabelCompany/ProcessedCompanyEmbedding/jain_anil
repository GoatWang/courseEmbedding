a person based on physical or behavioral attributes  it is a rapidly evolving field with applications ranging from securely accessing one’s computer to gaining entry into a country while the deployment of largescale biometric systems in both commercial and government applications has increased the public awareness of this technology introduction to biometrics is the first textbook to introduce the fundamentals of biometrics to undergraduategraduate students the three commonly used modalities in the biometrics field namely fingerprint face and iris are covered in detail in this book few other modalities like hand geometry ear and gait are also discussed briefly along with advanced topics such as multibiometric systems and security of biometric systems exercises for each chapter will be available on the book website to help students gain a better understanding of the topics and obtain practical experience in designing computer programs for biometric applications these can be found at httpwwwcseewvuedurossbiometricstextbookdesigned for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and electrical engineering introduction to biometrics is also suitable for
