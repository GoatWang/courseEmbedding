becomes a top franchise owner edith kellygreen ranks as the largest multiple unit franchise owner for lenny’s sub shop by carolyn m brown    posted july   a   a   a   in  after some  years of service with fedex edith kellygreen entered into retirement at the time the yearold cancer survivor relished the thought of having nothing to do “which is what i did for about a year” says the former and first african american female vice president and chief sourcing officer for memphisbased fedex express it was while sitting in a starbucks and reading the paper that she learned a local lenny’s sub shop was for sale kellygreen’s daughter jayna a college student at the time and frequent patron of lenny’s sub shop raved about the food and the concept headquartered in memphis the franchise features sliced to order submarine sandwiches and authentic philadelphiastyle cheesesteak sandwhiches kellygreen was looking for a way to create a legacy and ongoing wealth for her family she made a phone call to inquire about investing in the brand but ended up becoming a franchisee since she was financially secure kellygreen wasn’t seeking supplemental income when she acquired her first store in  in oxford mississippi her hometown today she is the largest multiunit franchise owner of lenny’s sub shop over a period of six years kellygreen purchased  lenny’s sub shops in memphis and in oxford her shops average annual sales revenues between  and  million she currently runs her stores—two of which consistently rank in the top  of all lenny’s sub shop locations across the country—with her two sons james kelly and ryan green in addition she served as one of five franchisees with a seat on lenny’s advisory board until  and green was the first ever recipient of the black enterprise small business award for franchise owner of the year when the new category was added to the mix for  to reflect growing opportunities for minorities in franchising kellygreen is in a unique position as a multiple unit franchise owner african americans are  less likely to be multiunit operators of all african america franchisees  are singleunit owners and  are multiunit owners versus  singleunit and  multiunit owners for all franchisees a singleunit franchisee is a person who owns one store and is responsible for the daytoday operations whereas a multiunit franchisee is an owners of multiple stores that are typically sold at a reduced rate per unit right from the start kellygreen knew she didn’t want to be a single location owner “i wanted to own at least  stores that was my objective” she recalls her training as a cpa has been invaluable she knows how to account for every penny of the business as well as handle payroll and sales taxes her background working with fedex’s supply chain also proved useful in handling vendors understanding purchasing and reducing costs kellygreen’s recipe for success and ability to scale has been partnering she partnered with marlin harris in eight lenny’s locations until his death in  when the two first met harris owned six stores with different partners not only was he one of the original employees hired by lenny’s founder len moore but he also was moore’s partner in the first three stores during lenny’s startup phase in  kellygreen and harris first bought a lenny’s sub shop at memphis international airport then in  kellygreen bought out harris’ other partners to acquire ownership in six additional stores “he had experience running the store” she explains “it made sense to combine his operational skills with my skills in human resources and finance” the following year the partners opened their first store from scratch “it was a great location probably one of the bestlooking stores in the neighborhood near the university university of memphis” she says “but when the economy went down during the great recession we felt it people were eating at home and going to cheaper places” she adds the store has its ups and downs but is profitable the franchisee also runs concessions for memphis’ liberty bowl memorial stadium and fairgrounds “each store has its own personality profitability is a function of your location market and employees” notes that yearold franchisee kellygreen notes that much of her training at fedex focused on customer service transferrable skills and philosophy hire the right employees provide them with the right training and ensure employees are customeroriented happy customers are repeat customers “that generates sales and incremental revenues that is how you get a return as an owner” she adds that the decision to open more lenny’s sub shop stores is dependent upon three things personality profile and profitability of a particular shop’s location “as a family we are evaluating opportunities in our current franchise and other brands” she adds so “we may diversify our portfolio” ﻿ ﻿ related stories how to build a real connection with customers behind the growing popularity of

continually developed new ways to connect and create more effective community leaders who want to make a difference ten years after the assassination of dr martin luther king jr leadership memphis was founded as part of an effort to change the international image and reality of a city divided by race recognizing the need for a new breed of leaders that would unify memphis and respect its diversity memphis leaders drew inspiration from leadership programs in nashville and atlanta which provided leaders with nine months of indepth information about their cities and sparked new alliances between diverse citizens several memphis organizations set leadership development as their top priority and when this building interest in new leaders converged the foundation was laid for the organization that would become leadership memphis the first class of  persons was convened in december  hearing the governorelect lamar alexander challenge them to take charge of the city’s destiny from the beginning leadership memphis’ programming was anchored by its emphasis on racial reconciliation the sessions on diversity were complemented by sessions on justice health care and hospitals media environment and faith in june  leadership memphis held its first celebration of leadership which became an annual tribute to civic leadership and the organization’s most popular event as an arena for civic understanding leadership memphis has been a leader fighting the vestiges of racism embracing leaders from all sectors of the city and convening diverse people in honest conversation about their city’s future now over  years after the birth of leadership memphis it is impossible for many of its current class members to understand the despair and division that it was created to combat that in itself is an indicator that leadership memphis along with other organizations has had a positive impact on race relations in this community nearly  alumni have completed the executive fasttrack and grassroots programs among them are mayors city council members county commissioners city of memphis administrators shelby county administrators federal government administrators civic and community organization leaders public and private corporation executives clergy representing over a dozen denominations school or school system faculty and administrators health care executives professionals doctors attorneys and accountants and small business owners over  of leadership memphis’ alumni are africanamerican latino asian or of another culture leadership memphis continues to serve as a civic tool for forging new and meaningful relationships between unique blends of people from different sectors of the city without leadership memphis there are those who would never have had an opportunity to learn so much about the community other people and themselves going forward leadership memphis will be the standardbearer for strong progressive diverse leadership for memphis leadership memphis will work with others to build a great memphis by serving as our city’s window to the world and by encouraging a wideopen exchange of the best thinking ideas experiences and solutions the world has to offer our community’s leaders as memphis moves forward there is an increased urgency for leadership memphis to connect leaders to leaders leaders to information and leaders to community leadership

photo rob culpepper in  edith kellygreen was settling into retirement after almost  years with fedexultimately serving as vice president and chief sourcing officer for fedex express at the companys memphis tenn headquartersher days consisted of waking up early reading at starbucks and working on the finances of several nonprofits a suggestion from her family prompted kellygreen to consider opening a lennys sub shop my daughter was a college sophomore at the time and said ‘i eat there all the time you have to invest she remembers i knew the ceo and called him thinking id just invest some capital but he convinced me id be happier as a franchisee she bought her first location near her alma mater ole miss in oxford miss and in the last six years has added nine more stores near her memphis home but her sandwich empire hasnt been about making moneythough she does that wellor about a second act instead kellygreen got into the game hoping that her multiunit business the largest in the lennys chain would help her family and her community i wasnt bored in retirement in the least she says i just saw this as an opportunity to own a business and to create a legacy to have something to pass along to my children whether they want to maintain it or sell but the overarching effect is that it gives me the chance to support people it gives the citizens of memphis a template it encourages them to be in business for themselves and to strive to be more than minimumwage workers we talked to kellygreen about her notsoquiet retirement why did you go for multiple units after i opened my first unit in oxford i decided i didnt want to be a onelocation owner i wanted to own enough so when decisions are made at least i would be consulted if i was just one location out of  that wouldnt be the case not that i want veto power or anything but if something major is going on i want to get a phone call im impacted by decisions more than singleunit owners what role does your family play my daughter jayna who initially got me involved with lennys will be graduating from medical school in  so shes no longer involvedthough she can make a sandwich if she has to but my two sons james kelly and ryan green are working fulltime in the business ive tried to loosely split the stores but our roles overlap the thing about a franchise is once you solve one problem you can apply it through all  stores so theres lots of communication about how were handling things whats your leadership philosophy i try to create a sense of encouragement for employees and make them feel like they can own their own stores or manage multiple stores i try to create a vision or a sense of opportunity for others and i always want to create as many taxpaying citizens as possible i dont own these businesses to pay off a mortgage im financially secure so i can be more lenient with employees fedex taught me how important training is and how important good employees are when someone messes up i have to ask myself how well were they trained i can afford to give people second chances and sometimes third sure ive been burned several times but ive been surprised several times too how has being a cpa helped you run a franchise as an accountant at fedex it gave me the ability to see the business overall everything eventually comes through accounting at my franchises i have to account for every penny i look at the numbers every day if theres a deviation i investigate right away many entrepreneurs have great ideas but most dont want to deal with administrative tasks like sales taxes and payroll deposits those details are the downfall of many small businesses im maybe more comfortable with that most people just dont like dealing with numbers jason daley jason daley lives and writes in madison
