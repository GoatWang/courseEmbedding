new zealand fund for the period ended october   the funds net asset value nav on october   was us per share compared to us at the end of our october   fiscal year funds comparative performance the funds strategy continues to concentrate on a diversified portfolio of small and mediumsized stocks not readily available to individual us investors the most relevant index against which to compare the funds performance is the new zealand small company index nzsci that measures the performance of small to medium cap stocks of the new zealand market from october   to october   the nzsci decreased by  in local terms or by  in us dollar terms while the funds total return was  in united states dollars the fund therefore outperformed its benchmark over the period by  in analyzing comparisons of performance to the nzsci the reader should remember an index does not reflect currency conversions cash positions brokerage costs or administrative or management fees incurred by the fund or individual investor new zealand market overview the economy is growing at a steady but weak pace exports are robust but imports have outpaced them also rising oil prices are adding to inflationary pressures but domestic demand remains soft thereby helping keep the lid on inflation retail sales were robust with september sales increasing  excluding autos according to deutsche securities nz a weak nz currency the uncertainty of the impact on business of the new labour party led government foreign investor selling and poor performance from its star company telecom nz helped the market lower over the period going forward we believe the downside risk to be limited the government superannuation fund retirement fund will soon be allowed to invest in the equity market this means that close to nz million could be injected in the market over the year  the merger talks between the new zealand and the australian stock markets if effected could increase investor confidence in the new zealand market while attracting more foreign investments the signs of a currency recovery against the us dollar and the rally in the telecom nz shares in october up  are good indicators of a bottoming out ord

local currency will improve sentiment with the economic growth slowing down larger cap stocks are unlikely to outperform the small cap stocks we would focus on stock selection with emphasis on companies with increasing market positions reliable earnings and exposure to exports we believe the weaker currency has boosted their price competitiveness the australian market has provided attractive returns over the long run due to the countrys record of stable earnings growth and moderate inflation the transition into a serviceoriented economy is positive for the market its low correlation with the rest of the world makes it a safe hedge the market correction in  coupled with the weaker currency over the year present a good entry opportunity into this market we are pleased

portfolio securities which are traded on securities exchanges are valued at the last sales price on that exchange prior to the relevant closing or if there is no recent last sales price available at the last current bid quotation a security which is listed or traded on more than one exchange is valued at the quotation on the exchange determined to be the primary market for such security fixed income securities are valued using market quotations or pricing services in the absence of any applicable price securities will be valued at a fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures established by the board of trustees b currency translation  for purposes of determining the funds net asset value all assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currency values are converted into us dollar values at the prevailing market rate at  gmt on each us business day as established by the board of trustees the cost of securities is determined by using historical exchange rates income is translated at approximate rates prevailing when accrued the fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments which is due to changes in foreign exchange
