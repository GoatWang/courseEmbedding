mclachlan david peel isbn   pages october  description an uptodate comprehensive account of major issues in finite mixture modeling this volume provides an uptodate account of the theory and applications of modeling via finite mixture distributions with an emphasis on the applications of mixture models in both mainstream analysis and other areas such as unsupervised pattern recognition speech recognition and medical imaging the book describes the formulations of the finite mixture approach details its methodology discusses aspects of its implementation and illustrates its application in many common statistical contexts major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the em algorithm properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems the author also considers how the em algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases as in data mining applications this comprehensive practical guide  provides more than  references published since   includes an appendix listing available mixture software  links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature
