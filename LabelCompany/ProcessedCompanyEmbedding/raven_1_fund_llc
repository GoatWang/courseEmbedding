assurance of the economic success of any motion picture since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a motion picture depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public which cannot be predicted the commercial success of a motion picture also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films released into the marketplace at or near the same time general economic factors and other tangible and intangible factors all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty you may sustain a total loss of the funds you have invested the entertainment industry in general and the motion picture and television industry in particular are continuing to undergo significant changes primarily due to technological developments although these developments have resulted in the availability of alternative and competing forms of leisure time entertainment such technological developments have also resulted in the creation of additional revenue sources through licensing of rights to such new media and potentially could lead to future reductions in the costs of producing and distributing motion pictures in addition the theatrical success of a motion picture remains a crucial factor in generating revenues in other ancillary  media such as but not limited to dvds and television due to the rapid growth of technology shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on the potential revenue from and profitability of featurelength motion pictures raven fund i is in the organizational stage and is subject to all the risks incident to the creation and development of a new business including the absence of a history of operations and minimal net worth in order to prosper the success of raven fund  will depend partly upon the ability of management to produce a film of exceptional quality at a lower cost which can compete in appeal with higherbudgeted films of the same genre in order to minimize this risk management plans to participate as much as possible throughout the process and will aim to mitigate financial risks where possible fulfilling this goal depends on the timing of investor financing the ability to obtain distribution contracts with satisfactory terms and the continued participation of the current management please read the offering circular in full for more information on rick factors   what is the market for horror films the industry as a whole in north america is also thriving according to
