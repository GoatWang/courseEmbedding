jan   … suzanne sitherwood president of the laclede group will become the companys ceo on february   she works in her office monday january   in downtown st louis photo by erik m lunsford elunsfordpostdispatchcom erik m lunsford a selfdescribed military brat laclede group incs incoming chief executive officer suzanne sitherwood figures it was her childhood  spent on military bases surrounded by mechanized equipment  that steered her toward engineering that interest merged with opportunity in college when she got a chance to work for atlanta gas light while attending southern college of technology it was basically a campus with a fence barbed wire at the top and men in uniforms it just looked like a military base to me she said it even had the grey desks in the office so i felt right at home three decades later sitherwood left the atlantabased company now called agl resources for laclede but not until rising to become a senior executive in the nations largest gas distribution utility she moved to st louis on labor day weekend and has spent the past few months learning the company and preparing to succeed douglas h yaeger as ceo on feb  sitherwood recently spoke with the postdispatch about the transition how do you see this opportunity laclede is very similar to what agl looked and felt like in  its got a very strong financial foundation the executive team is very strong the employees are very oriented around customer service this company has a lot of strengths and it has a lot of ability to grow and i wanted to be part of that in my prior position i was the president reporting to the ceo who is a young man hes talented hes probably not going anywhere anytime soon and i had the opportunity to join laclede as the ceo and it just felt like a very natural fit what similarities do you see with atlanta gas light and how did that company change what happened in  is agl created a parent company agl resources much like here you have laclede group and you have laclede gas what we started doing at agl is implementing a growth strategy in terms of acquisitions so now agl resources is from new jersey to florida over to houston and all the way up to illinois its the largest natural gas distribution company in north america laclede has a lot of opportunities to grow as well were not ever going to do a bad deal but with the energy sector today theres a lot of opportunity for consolidation for a lot of different reasons the leadership team hopes to be able to grow as a result of the market conditions atlanta has been a very fastgrowing city and very different from st louis how do you size up this city so far atlanta does have that reputation but like many large cities in the us today it was one of the hardest hit because of banking and housing downturns so that growth has significantly slowed down i believe growth is driven by some natural occurrences you have to have water  be it industrial or residential growth and people tend to follow jobs which means housing the other part of the formula is you have to have energy when i look at the st louis region you have a strong electric provider you have peabody here and of course laclede so energy is important in that formula another thing theyre looking at is schools not just k but also advanced learning and the st louis area and missouri has a strong advanced education system the other piece is healthcare and again i give the st louis area and missouri high marks what are the implications of the shale gas boom and influx of relatively inexpensive natural gas for laclede you look at the shale gas and the locations of those supplies and then you look at the interstate pipelines and lacledes connectivity back to those supply basins the punchline to all that is you can get the gas to market and with not a lot of infrastructure investment not a lot of capital investment so its uniquely positioned in the midwest to play a key role in terms of delivering natural gas to markets have you encountered any challenges as a woman rising through the energy industry which tends to be maledominated more than some others ive always in my career made a point of having a mentor and they would usually change every two years good coaching and insight along the trajectory matters and ive had some wonderful mentors who have encouraged me given me the right guidance at the right time quite frankly i never limited myself or felt like i was being held back because i was a woman maybe because i played sports growing up maybe because i lived on military bases i dont know i dont know what the secret sauce is but all i do know is youre right there are not a lot of women in this industry but ive been fortunate to have a lot of good people including my

google youtube rss search for st louis suzanne sitherwood and the laclede group have the pedal to the metal concerning growth by dennis seeds  pm edt november  am edt june   growing up on military bases suzanne sitherwood felt right at home when she started in the oil and gas industry as a coop college student working as a field worker for atlanta gas light co “i was out on trucks in the dirt with pipes and meters and so forth” sitherwood says “growing up on military bases it was an easy connection because of the men trucks uniforms barbed wire fences and pipes it all felt very familiar” she enjoyed what she was doing so much that following college graduation she decided to continue with the gas company after  years at atlanta gas light co where she had become president she was recruited to the laclede group inc in late  as president and became ceo in february  the laclede group inc is a public utility holding company its primary subsidiary laclede gas co is the largest natural gas distribution utility in missouri serving about  residential commercial and industrial customers in st louis and  other counties with sitherwood’s expertise in the industry and the laclede group poised for growth the combination sparked a period of change “part of the reason we created the laclede group was for growth” sitherwood says “that was one of the reasons the board recruited me here i was one of the architects with the prior company i had worked for and it became the largest in its peer group “so the board was interested in bringing me here and growing the laclede group so we weren’t just one gas company but could become several gas companies” here’s how sitherwood got the laclede group off and running toward growth mode prepare for change having built her previous employer into the largest in its peer group sitherwood knew how to grow a business now she was joining a new company that she had to get acquainted with before making any sudden decisions “i came here in september  and that gave me a chance to lay low and meet the executive team get to know the strength and talent that existed here and begin to formulate that day plan” sitherwood says “i had a great opportunity between september and february to do just that so when feb  rolled around we were ready to move forward” even more than getting up to speed sitherwood was pleased to see that the laclede group had balance sheet strength and strong leadership already in place “if you’re going to have a growth plan you need to have a strong balance sheet” she says “it was nice to see a yearold company ready for growth the other piece was the senior leadership there was a very strong team in place however it wasn’t organized in a way that it could integrate other gas companies” in order for the laclede group to bring in other gas companies to grow its portfolio sitherwood led a reorganization to lineup talent in specific roles and build the company into a business unit structure that could integrate additional gas companies “i needed to restructure the company to be business units with shared services” she says “the other challenge was technology we’ve implemented a threeyear technology plan to have enterprise systems so we can scale our technology to those other companies “we also needed to have standardized policies and procedures they existed from an institutional perspective and generally the company knew how it operated around certain policies but they weren’t documented transparent and available so we did that” lastly the way laclede communicated and engaged the rest of the company was very insular because it was just a single gas company sitherwood needed to change that mentality “if you’re going to have a growth strategy you need to talk to your employees” sitherwood says “you need to be able to explain your industry and why you’re doing that and they need to believe in it but also there are external stakeholders we needed to be very proactive about talking to the investment community regulators our board and our shareholders “we needed to make sure that we were saying the same thing to our employees that we were telling the regulators and investors we’ve spent a lot of time on that endeavor and quite frankly i think we’ve done a nice job on that” what was most crucial for sitherwood in those first few months at laclede was the ability to get acquainted with the company and then create a vision for growth “you have to do your homework the first  days” she says “don’t come in assuming one thing or the other come in and do your homework but then chart that vision and stay focused on it to keep it alive “sometimes you can come in with a lot of energy and then slow down instead of keeping that pace if you back off the pedal after six to eight months it quits feeling real to people” while you have to remain focused on your vision and growth objectives you might also have to adapt to certain circumstances as you go “if it’s anything like it is around here you’re changing the tires while you’re driving the car” sitherwood says “you’ve got to keep the energy and the pace up but at the same time not overwork people and keep them energized around it” embrace your growth soon after sitherwood came to the laclede group the company had entered into negotiations to buy a company called missouri gas energy sitherwood’s restructuring was a big reason the company was a frontrunner in those negotiations “had we not restructured yes we could have grown but going through that due diligence process that bid process we had a clear line of sight to what that would look like because we already had the organizational structure in place” sitherwood says “if i had closed that transaction and brought that company in while having to reorganize at the same time it would be more chaos that’s not necessary” some would argue against putting the organization in place first because there is either an expense to that or there is a danger you won’t grow “i find that very interesting because if i have a growth strategy and we all believe in it we’re going to grow” she says “why wouldn’t you organize around that why wouldn’t you put the fundamentals in place from a financial perspective and policy perspective and then stay focused on your vision” laclede acquired missouri gas energy from energy transfer partners lp in september  “energy transfer partners was clear from day one that missouri gas energy was not strategic to them and they were going to divest this gas company” sitherwood says “so we started working through a very competitive bid process and at the end of the day we were the bidder of choice “this is not a oneanddone we’ve got a pretty strong corporate development group and we’re constantly modeling and analyzing other opportunities and we hope to continue to grow the gas business” as of august laclede gas co served  customers and with the missouri gas energy acquisition it added north of  customers “when you add the two utilities together we serve around  million to  million customers” she says “why that matters to us is because we’re here to serve those customers as a gas company “the other metric i look at is how interested are institutional buyers and retail buyers in us when we went to market to issue our equity we ended up having a very strong offering what that told me was people were very interested in us had done their homework on our financial metrics and that was validating to me that we had the right strategy” in addition to a focus on acquisitions the laclede group started a brand called spire which is all about natural gaspowered vehicles further expanding the company’s services “this could be the future of natural gas in our country” sitherwood says “out of all the hydrocarbons natural gas is  to  percent cleaner the supply is long because of shell gas about  years the prices are low and volatility is nonexistent there’s a  spread in terms of a per gallon equivalent natural gas vehicles today seem to make sense” spire was launched in partnership with siemens and is just another part of sitherwood’s grand vision to grow the laclede group “i enjoy the idea of growing this company” sitherwood says “we’re now off and running” ●    takeaways do your due diligence when acquiring a new company construct a vision for growth and
