service performed pro bono legal work for low income clients and prisoners statement zamboni john scannell has been one of the few attorneys in the state that has actively been supporting the american bar associations long standing criticism of the washington attorney disciplinary system he has filed a federal rico lawsuit citing the problems the washington state bar association has created by administering the system the washington state supreme court is in charge of the system but the court has come under sharp criticism for  years for its practice of delegating its responsibility to the washington state bar association the aba rightly likens this to the practice of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse with washington being one of the few state that still continue this practice the practice of putting a politically elected bar leadership in charge of attorney discipline has resulted in low charging rates discipline directed at attorney who represent unpopular clients as well as discipline directed at minority attorneys in disproportionate numbers john scannell appears to be the only candidate that advocates taking the bar association out of the disciplinary process

washington supreme court primary position   candidate vote  votes barbara madsen incumbent   greg zempel  john scannell  total votes  of  reporting   source washington secretary of state official results race background the  election was the first since the s in which all three state supreme court justices up for reelection faced opponents at least one justice in every election typically runs unopposed but this year all three incumbents drew challengers republican state representative matt manweller said he and other lawmakers actively recruited candidates to run against the justices this was partly because of the courts decisions in the longrunning school funding case mccleary v washington over which the court drew criticism from both republicans and democrats for holding the state in contempt of court and in a separate case about the state funding of charter schools those in favor of replacing the justices said the court has overstepped its boundaries into legislation and policymaking and failed to respect the autonomy of the state legislature in the mccleary school funding case the court both found the state government in contempt and fined the state  per day until the state complied with the courts orders in a separate case the court ruled unconstitutional the state funding of charter schools right before those schools were set to open in  outside spending the political action committee arm of the group stand for children spent  promoting the campaign of greg zempel who challenged chief justice barbara madsen for her seat on the court madsen authored the courts  decision declaring washingtons charter schools in their form at that time unconstitutional the legislature passed a new bill in  that allowed charter schools to continue opponents threatened to sue over this law as well stand for childrens spending on zempels campaign was funded by several of the backers of charter schools who were opposed to the courts  decision the primary donors include connie ballmer wife of former microsoft ceo steve ballmer reed hastings founder and ceo of netflix and vulcan inc owned by microsoft cofounder paul allen vulcan and ballmer were also among the primary backers of the ballot initiative that paved the way for the charter schools  see also washington judicial elections  scannell ran for election to the washington supreme courtgeneral he was

election in  scannell was investigated by the washington state bar association regarding a case he had in virginia scannell argued that this was outside the bars jurisdiction scannell however was subsequently disbarred in the state of washington not for any misconduct involving the virginia case which was dismissed but because he had obstructed the bar associations investigation of that case he continued fighting his disbarment in other ways one attempt involved running for the office of justice of the washington supreme court scannell was on the ballot but only symbolically since the washington state constitution required a candidate for judicial office to be an attorney and admitted to practice in the states courts to remove scannell from the ballot someone would have had to bring a legal challenge however debra l stephens his challenger for the seat said she had no plans to do so scannell had filed suit against the bar association in federal court reportedly in hopes of being able to at least practice in federal courts he was successful with the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which only gave him a twoyear suspension and scannell was back to practicing
