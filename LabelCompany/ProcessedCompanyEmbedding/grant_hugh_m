possibilities one we simply do not make a kit for your vehicle two we have not researched your vehicle you can call our customer service department for assistanceremember  never use a grant installation kit on a vehicle not listed in our application guide this is for your safety and well being i have a street rod or other custom vehicle and do not know what the steering column is out of how can i purchase a grant wheel and installation kit installation kits are vehicle specific you will need to find out the exact year make and model of vehicle your steering column was in many times you may need to find numbers off the column so that you can and go to a dealer to find this information grant personnel cannot help you locate the model numbers or verify makemodel information i have an ididit or flaming river steering column what kit do i use all ididit and flaming river columns use the  kit you may need to purchase the plastic sleeve that is found on all columns where this kit is used if you do not have this part you will need to go to a wrecking yard or to a gm dealer and purchase this inexpensive part general technical questions i am having trouble installing a grant product what should i do first be sure that you are following the grant instruction sheet the answers to most of these questions can be found in the instructions sheets provided with the kits and wheels it is a good idea to have all of the instruction sheets with you for review and reference when diagnosing and fixing a problemif you need to read or print the instructions search for the product by part number or keyword using the keyword search at the top of this page how can i get my horn to work again after installing a classic or challenger wheel you probably have a painted black silver or gold wheel you must use the silver foil disc that is packed in the back of the horn button along with an instruction sheet follow these instructions form  for its use and your problem will be solved how can i keep the horn from blowing during installation of my grant wheel and kit be sure to remove the horn fuse or disconnect your battery before installation remember to reinstall fuse or reconnect battery when done how can i get my turn signals to cancel properly there are many different types of cancellation cams used some are removable from the back of the original wheel and some are not even some that are removable are not compatible with the back of the grant hub use the original cam if it will fit onto the back of the grant hub just like the original wheel if not see belowwhen the original cam will not work with the grant hub use the roll pins provided in the kit and install per the directions provided these will do the same job as your original mechanism you may need to bend the pins slightly as instructed for proper operation what is the clicking sound i hear when turning my steering wheel this sound is caused by not correctly adjusting the roll pins proper adjustment will solve the problem and prevent damage to your turn signal mechanism improper adjustment can cause damage or failure and result in your having to replace the turn signal mechanism after installation there is either a large gap or rubbing interference between the post cover and my steering column how do i correct this in designing grant kits we allow for a  gap between the post cover and the steering column many older vehicles may have been modified rebuilt or repaired and have had the steering columns removed from the vehicle there is adjustment built into many of these columns loosen the bolts holding the column into position under dash and slide the housing up or down to the desired clearance and then retighten the bolts securely where do i install the brown retainer contactor ring and large spring from my kit on my signature wheel the brown retainer contactor ring large spring and  shoulder bolts in the kit are not used with a signature series wheel refer to instruction sheet that came with your steering wheel form  the classicchallenger wheel i bought wont fit onto my euro kit  series billet kit  series or telescopic gm kit  whats wrong nothing is wrong the euro and billet series kits are designed to only be used with signature series wheels with the  bolt mounting pattern the classicchallenger series wheels bolt pattern will not work with these kits my new grant steering wheel is too close to the turn signal wiper or shift levers what can i do you can purchase our model  extension kit that mounts between the already installed installation kit and the steering wheel it moves the wheel back  for clearance my new grant signature series wheel is too far back toward my chest can i move the wheel forward toward the dash you can purchase our model  black finish or  polished finish spacers these are only  tall vs the  standard collar and will move the wheel toward the dash  for additional clearance the grant custom hub does not slide all the way down onto my shaft like the original wheel do i have the right kit if you looked up the correct application and got the kit listed you probably have the right kit if the box was opened when you bought it you may want to call us to verify the hub number for proper fitment since grant hubs are die cast the tolerances are intentionally slightly tighter than your stock wheel we recommend that you put the grant hub down as far as it will go by hand follow the instructions and install the post cover shaft nut…etc and tighten down to the recommended torque setting this should properly seat the hub onto shaft the horn button on my challengerclassic wheel will not go on what am i doing wrong on many ford vehicles starting in  there is an unused stub on the end of the steering shaft this stub will need to be cut off with a hacksaw or equivalent see the instructions provided with kit for the proper procedurethe brown retainer contact or ring is on upside down make sure the brown side is facing up toward you and the metal side is down i need to do some work on my steering column how do i get the grant custom hub off you will need to use a steering wheel puller that will pull at three points we sell an inexpensive puller that will not only pull our hub but will pull off most original steering wheels pn  sold at most outlets that carry grant steering wheels questions regarding general motors vehicles when using kit number  my wheel is crooked how can i get it straight classicchallenger wheels – refer to form  instructions and follow steps  and  regarding routing of the horn lead wiresignature wheels – refer to the signature series optional installation sheet in kit and perform steps a and c i am using kit number  and cant find the plastic sleeve referred to in the instructions is it missing from my kit no we do not provide this part in the kit the plastic sleeve is an existing component on all the vehicles where kit  is used if you do not have this part you will need to go to a wrecking yard or to a gm dealer and purchase this inexpensive part questions regarding ford motors vehicles how can i keep the fuse from blowing on my ford vehicle after installing a signature wheel you must cut the ground lead from the horn button refer to the instructions supplied with wheel form  for the proper procedure i have a classic mustanger wheel and the horn button does not want to stay on how do i make it work correctly this button is unique because you cannot use the spring that came in the installation kit you must use the foam spacers provided with the button or wheel and eliminate the spring install the foam spacers per the instructions and your problem should be solved i purchased kit number  and the post cover is stamped off center is this normal yes the column on this vehicle is egg shaped and the shaft is not centered we had to make the cover this way your instruction sheet form  explains this questions regarding jeep vehicles i have a jeep using kit number  and i dont have a wire coming out of my horn contact housing but a metal connector how do i get the grant wire connected you will need to pull this metal plunger out of the plastic tube and replace it with the wire provided in our kit simply grab the plunger and pull straight out reuse the plastic snap sleeve that will come out with plunger to hold our wire in housing just as before questions regarding grant vehicle security system i lost the keys to my vehicle security system what can i do about getting replacements provided you sent in the registration
