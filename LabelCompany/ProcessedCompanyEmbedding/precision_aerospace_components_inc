conformity with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx and the related rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” accordingly certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations however we believe that the disclosures included in these consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this document have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and in the company’s opinion reflect all adjustments which include normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with gaap and sec regulations for interim financial statements the results for the three months ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company will have for any subsequent period these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended december   included in the company’s annual report on form k filed on march          table of contents   earnings loss per share   basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the year basic earnings loss per share excludes any dilutive effects of options warrants and other stockbased compensation which are included in diluted earnings per share when a company is in a loss situation all outstanding dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings because their inclusion would be antidilutive and the basic and fully diluted common shares outstanding are stated to be the same   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates the significant estimates are the useful lives of tangible assets reserves for inventory and accounts receivable and the valuation of shareholder put option   inventory   inventories are carried at the lower of cost on an average cost basis or market when necessary management records an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon knowledge of future demand of inventory on hand as well as other market conditions and events as of march   and december   the inventory reserve was  and  respectively   management believes that the longer a part sits on the shelf the higher the likelihood that it will not sell in the future this belief is not unique to the fastener industry while management constantly assesses viability of a part within the customer base it also believes that a reserve should be carried to reflect product that is aging out as opposed to product that management identified based on a specific event as of march   the company had more than  unique part numbers on hand that had carrying value management believes that the two methods specific identification and reserve based on age to analyzing inventory will reflect the appropriate balance sheet value   concentration of credit risk   for the three month period ending march   sales to paccar accounted for

with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and the fair value election for financial assets and financial liabilities a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability a threetiered hierarchy was established that draws a distinction between market participant assumptions based on the following   i observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level  ii inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly level  iii unobservable inputs that require the company to use present value and other valuation techniques in the determination of fair value level    financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy   income taxes   the company provides for income taxes under asc topic  asc topic  requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse temporary differences relate primarily to different accounting methods used for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and recording the inventory reserve   asc topic  requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized   asc topic  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions as defined it requires among other matters that the company recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position the company analyzes the filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where the company is required to file income tax returns as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions as of march   the company did not record any unrecognized tax benefits the company’s policy if it had unrecognized benefits is to recognize accrued interest and

operations   the company distributes highquality predominantly domesticallymanufactured technically complex nut and bolt products and a proprietary locking washer product that are used primarily for industrialcommercial applications that require a high level of certified and assured qualityon april   the company sold substantially all of the assets of aeromissile   the company’s aerospace operations were carried out through its whollyowned distribution subsidiary aeromissile  which has stocking distributor relationships with a number of united states fastener manufacturers and who sell high technology specially engineered fasteners  nuts and bolts  predominantly to all levels of the aviation industries original equipment manufacturers maintenance and repair organizations and other distributors as well as to the united states department of defense “department of defense” creative assembly is a value added distributor of proprietary and specialty fasteners for production primarily serving the heavy truck automotive appliance and material handling industries        table of contents   the company’s products are manufactured by others to exacting specifications and are made from materials that provide the strength and reliability required for their industrial applications   the company is a niche player in the north american fastener industry the fastener distribution industry is highly fragmented with no single company holding a dominant position the company competes with numerous distributors who serve as authorized stocking distributors for the fastener manufacturers in the company’s supplier base   the company is a onestop source for standard selflocking semispecial and special nuts bolts and washers manufactured to several industrial specifications the company maintains an inventory of approximately  skus comprised of approximately  million parts of premium quality brand name fastener products   the company sells its products pursuant to written purchase orders from its customers all products are shipped from the company’s warehouses via common carrier   as a result of the sale of substantially all of the assets of aeromissile and the reclassification of aeromissile’s activity into discontinued operations the remainder of this discussion relates only to our cas subsidiary and does not include sales and operations for our aeromissile subsidiary   paccar inc represented approximately  of the company’s total sales for the three months ended march   waterous company represented approximately  of sales

industrial products represent approximately  of product distributed for the three months ending march   versus for thethree months ending march     for the periods ending march   and december   avk accounted for  and  of payables respectively   results from operations for three months ending march     the company’s revenues decreased approximately  or  for three months ended march   to from  in the comparable period last year   slowdowns in the class  truck market were the primary contribution to the decrease in sales the nature of our sales relationship does not allow us to increase unit pricings as production volumes drop   the company’s gross profit decreased approximately  or for the three months ended march   to  from  in the comparable period last year from time to time the company will experience margin mix that will lead to temporarily higher or lower gross profit   the company’s total operating expenses increased  or  for the three months march   to  from  in the comparable period last year this is largely a result of additions to staffing related to the company’s long term growth plan   the company’s accounts receivable have increased by approximately  to  at march   from  at december   this difference is due to mainly to normal deviations in customer payments the company’s inventory has increased approximately  as of march   from december   the company expects to see a continued trend of increasing inventory levels to support the company’s growth plans        table of contents   liquidity   the company believes that it can meet its financial obligations for a period of  months from the date of this report at its presently contemplated operating levels however if the anticipated sales levels are not attained the company’s availability to access its line of credit would be adversely affected the company is presently seeking to expand its capital availability which will enable the company to fully take advantage of sales opportunities presented to it which require the company to make additional investments in inventory   the company believes it can expand its business with its present staff numbers   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   this item is not required for smaller reporting companies and if it were required is not applicable to the company’s present operations   item  controls and procedures   a disclosure controls and procedures   we carried out an evaluation with the participation of our chief executive officer who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer required by rules a and d of the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act based on this evaluation our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at march   as to ensure that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our sec reports i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures due to the existence of material weaknesses   the material weaknesses are as follows   · a lackof sufficient resources including a designated chief financial officer and an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight which restricted the company’s ability to gather analyze and report information relative to the financial statement assertions in a timely manner including insufficient documentation and review of selection of generally accepted accounting principles   · the limited size of the accounting department makes it impractical to achieve an appropriate level of segregation of duties specifically due to lack of personnel effective controls were not designed and implemented to ensure accounting functions were properly segregated   · due to a lack of adequate staffing within the finance department and adequate staffing within operational departments that provide information to the finance department we did not establish and maintain effective controls over certain of our periodend financial close and reporting processes specifically effective controls were not designed and implemented to ensure that journal entries were properly prepared with sufficient support or documentation or were reviewed and approved to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the journal entries recorded   the company may add additional personnel and procedures which we believe will remedy these weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures in future periods however there are no assurances we will be able to devote the necessary capital to hire the additional personnel and institute the additional systems policies and procedures to the level necessary in that event there are no assurances that the material weaknesses described above will be timely remediated or not result in errors in our financial statements in future periods   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule af under the exchange act during the period covered by this report that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting        table of contents   part ii other information   item  exhibits   the following
