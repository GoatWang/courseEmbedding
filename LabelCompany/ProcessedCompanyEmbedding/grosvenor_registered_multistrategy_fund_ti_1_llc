investments the master fund adheres to fundamental investment restrictions that are substantially the same as those of the fund these investment restrictions may not be changed by the master fund without the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the master fund the investment restrictions and other policies described herein do not apply to investment funds if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or the value of the funds or the master funds total assets unless otherwise stated will not constitute a violation of such restriction or policy risk factors the funds investment program is speculative and entails substantial risks there can be no assurance that the funds investment objectives will be achieved the funds performance depends upon the performance of the master fund which in turn will depend on the performance of the investment managers with which the master fund invests and grosvenors ability to select allocate and reallocate effectively the master funds assets among them each investment managers use of leverage short sales and derivative transactions in certain circumstances can result in significant losses the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate with changes in the values of the master funds investments

managers can result in significant losses to the master fund and indirectly to the fund  the master fund invests in investment funds that may not have diversified investment portfolios thereby increasing investment risk  there are special tax risks associated with an investment in the fund see item  and item   interests are not traded on any securities exchange or other market and are

performancebased allocations that are borne by the master fund as an investor in investment funds may be higher than those of most other registered investment companies investing in investment funds involves special risks including the following  investment funds generally will not be registered as investment companies under the  act therefore the master fund as an investor in investment funds will not have the benefit of the protections afforded by the  act to investors in registered investment companies such as mutual funds  an investment fund may in some cases concentrate its investments in a single industry or group of related industries this increases the sensitivity of its investment returns to economic factors affecting that industry or group of industries however the master fund will adhere to its own investment restrictions with respect to concentration when investing in investment funds  the adviser andor grosvenor receives detailed information from each investment manager regarding its investment performance and investment strategy the adviser andor grosvenor may have little or no means of independently verifying information provided by investment managers and thus may not be able to ascertain whether investment managers are adhering to their disclosed investment strategies and their investment and risk management policies an investment manager may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to the adviser andor grosvenor which may involve risks that are not anticipated by the adviser andor grosvenor  the board of directors of the master fund has approved procedures pursuant to which the master fund will value its investments in investment funds at fair value in accordance with these procedures fair value of these investments ordinarily will be the value determined as of the end of the fiscal period by the investment manager of each investment fund in accordance with the investment funds valuation policies and as reported by the investment manager the master fund relies primarily on information provided by investment managers in valuing its investments in investment funds there is a risk that inaccurate valuations provided by investment managers could adversely affect the value of interests and the amounts members receive upon the repurchase of interests because investment funds provide net asset value information on a monthly basis and may not provide detailed information on their investment positions except on an annual basis the master fund generally will not be able to determine the fair value of its investments in investment funds or its net asset value other than as of the end of each month and may not be able to verify valuation information given to the master fund by investment managers  investment managers typically charge assetbased management fees and typically also are entitled to receive performancebased allocations the master fund as an investor in investment funds will be subject to these fees and a pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th allocations which will reduce the investment returns of the fund these fees and allocations are in addition to the management fee the fund pays to the adviser and the advisory fee the master fund pays to the adviser  the performancebased allocations to investment managers may create an incentive for investment managers to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than those that might have been made in the absence of performancebased allocations in addition because a performancebased allocation is generally calculated on a basis that includes unrealized appreciation of an investment funds assets the allocation may be greater than if it were based solely on realized gains  each investment manager will receive any performancebased allocations to which it is entitled irrespective of the performance of the other investment managers and the master fund generally accordingly an investment manager with positive performance may receive performancebased compensation from the master fund which is borne indirectly by members even if the master funds overall returns are negative  investment decisions for investment funds are made by investment managers independently of each other as a result at any particular time one investment fund may be purchasing shares of an issuer whose shares are being sold by another investment fund consequently the master fund could incur indirectly certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result  the master fund expects to purchase nonvoting securities of an investment fund or waive some or all of its right to vote its securities with respect to investment funds consequently it will not be able to vote on matters that require the approval of the investors in the investment fund including matters that could adversely affect the master funds investment in the investment fund  the master fund may make additional investments in or effect withdrawals from investment funds only at certain specified times the master fund may not be able to withdraw its investment in an investment fund promptly after it has made a decision to do so which

taxpayers these limitations may apply to a members share of some or all of the funds expenses including interest expense to the extent that the expenses are not considered to be trade or business

evaluation and approval of investment strategies the subadvisers investment committee is responsible for overseeing the identification and evaluation of and approving or disapproving the investment strategies in which the grosvenormanaged accounts including the master fund may invest in determining whether to approve a particular investment strategy the subadvisers investment committee typically examines factors such as the following i the historical returns of the investment strategy in various market environments ii the fundamental factors driving the expected profitability of the investment strategy iii the expected returns from the investment strategy over a market cycle iv the expected variability of the investment strategys returns over a market cycle v the magnitude of a potential loss in extremely adverse markets vi the extent to which the performance of the investment strategy is expected to correlate with that of traditional market indices as well as with investment strategies already being used by the grosvenormanaged accounts and with certain other investment strategies vii the liquidity characteristics of the underlying securities used in implementing the investment strategy viii the degree of difficulty in pricing and hedging the underlying securities used in implementing the investment strategy ix the cost of implementing the investment strategy including transaction costs and fees and expenses paid to the investment managers that implement the investment strategy and x the quality of the pool of investment managers available to implement the investment strategy the subadvisers investment committee generally focuses on identifying strategies that rely on a fundamental investment approach and that employ techniques designed to mitigate systemic or market risks the investment committee believes that such strategies are better suited to achieving quality returns than strategies driven solely by market timing technical analysis or market direction as described more fully below the subadvisers investment committee currently approves three general categories of investment strategies for use by the grosvenormanaged accounts which it defines as equity strategies arbitragecredit strategies and opportunistic strategies the strategies currently approved by the investment committee focus primarily on the markets in the united states europe and japan and to a lesser extent in the emerging markets in latin america eastern europe and asiaexjapan the general categories of investment strategies approved by the investment committee may change from time to time equity strategies equity strategies involve the purchase andor short sale of equity and equitylinked securities in global markets an equity investment manager may focus on a particular capitalization range eg small cap vs large cap or a particular industry sector eg healthcare technology or consumer may employ a specific investment style eg value vs growth or may pursue a broad mandate investing in securities without specific regard for their issuers capitalization sector or geography some investment managers b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th may employ an activist approach whereby they attempt to influence company management to take specific measures to maximize shareholder value while others may utilize top down macroeconomic analysis to guide capitalallocation strategies and fundamental security selection an equity investment manager generally seeks to capitalize on discrepancies between such investment managers own evaluation of the intrinsic value of an equity security and assessment of the forwardlooking prospects of the issuer of such security on the one hand and the consensus view reflected in the market price of such security on the other hand to the extent the master fund invests with equity investment managers it focuses and expects to continue to focus on investment managers that primarily employ hedged equity investment strategies a hedged equity investment manager typically implements its particular investment strategy by establishing long and short positions in equity or equitylinked instruments however although most hedged equity investment managers focus on establishing both long and short positions some of these investment managers may focus exclusively on establishing long or short positions in addition to selling securities short an equity investment manager may seek to hedge portfolio exposure by using instruments such as exchangetraded funds equitylinked options index options and futures an equity investment manager may also seek to manage risk by adopting topdown constraints on leverage limits on net market exposure net regional exposure and net sector exposure position size limits position stoploss limits and parameters relating to the number of its positions arbitragecredit strategies arbitragecredit strategies are broadly defined and include creditoriented eventdriven and relativevalue strategies that generally seek to exploit pricing anomalies across a variety of debt or equity securities or instruments the primary arbitragecredit strategies used by the investment managers currently approved by grosvenor are described below credit credit strategies include directional and hedged investments in debt securities credit derivatives and related instruments the primary investment approaches include directional credit  long credit long  short and directional credit  short credit strategies although diverse can exhibit highly correlated losses during certain market periods directional credit  long directional credit  long includes distressed investing long highyield credit direct lending structured credit and equity restructurings investment managers assigned to this category typically have a net exposure greater than  net long  distressed investing consists primarily of long and short directional investments in securities of companies that are in various stages of financial difficulty including investments in stressed and distressed companies the goal of the strategy is to earn an attractive absolute rate of return through investing in specific events with limited exposure to broad market fluctuations investment managers seek to capitalize on market opportunities resulting from a lack of information illiquidity excessive selling pressure and complexity of capital structures or securities  long highyield credit involves taking long positions in levered loans or highyield bonds the positions in this substrategy typically are motivated by fundamental credit views that may also consider technical market factors such as shortterm supplydemand imbalances an investment b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th manager may be long an issuing companys credit either by investing directly in bonds or loans or by establishing a synthetic long position through a credit default swap cds  direct lending investments typically are highyield loans to stressed or distressed companies that are asset rich but have limited liquidity and that need quick access to capital to refinance other debt prevent a covenant default or exploit an opportunity the investment manager directly originates these loans which typically include relatively high coupons and generous structuring fees in order to compensate for the less liquid nature of the instruments and other inherent risks of direct lending direct financing arrangements often will be collateralized with assets include restrictive covenants and provide upside equity participation  structured credit consists of positions in residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs assetbacked securities abs and corporate creditrelated structured credit instruments such as collateralized debt obligations cdo trade selection is based on fundamental analysis of the underlying assets as well as structural analysis of the structured credit vehicle including such vehicles cash flow waterfall  equity restructuring includes investing in spinoffs stubtrades postrestructuring equities postbankruptcy equities litigation equity trades and recapitalizations a postrestructuring equity investment involves purchasing the equity of a company that has completed a recent restructuring most commonly as part of a bankruptcy plan spinoffs are subsidiaries of large public companies that are distributed to shareholders as a means of enhancing shareholder value credit longshort credit longshort includes longshort credit intracredit arbitrage correlation trades and credit volatility arbitrage  longshort credit involves taking long and short positions that reflect relativevalue views between or among different credits groups of credits sectors or indices the positions in this substrategy typically are motivated by fundamental credit views with an appreciation for market technicals one example of a longshort credit trade is a pairs trade in which the investment manager may be long a companys cds and short a competitors cds or long a basket of telecom credits via cds and short a basket of financial services credits via cds not all positions entail related credits for example an investment manager may construct a portfolio that includes long positions in what it believes to be underpriced highyield credits and short positions in richly priced crossover credits  intracredit arbitrage involves taking long and short positions related to the same issuer and may include curve trades in which the investment manager establishes both long and short positions along a single issuers credit curve basis trades which consist of a long position in an issuers bond and a synthetic short position in the same bond via a cds or vice versa senior versus subordinated debt trades in which the investment manager is long senior secured debt and short subordinated debt of the same company or vice versa and debt versus equity trades in which the investment manager is long debt or cds of an issuer and short equity or equity options of the same issuer or vice versa  correlation trades involve arbitraging perceived mispricings in baskets or portfolios of credits versus the individual components of the basket an index or a highlycorrelated derivative of the basket frequently the trade is structured to be neutral to credit spread movements in the broad b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th market the securities used in the arbitrage may include cdos synthetic cdos bespoke cds baskets credit indices and individual cds synthetic cdos are similar to cdos except that the credits are included in the pool via cds contracts instead of cash bonds bespoke cds baskets represent a collection of credits that are selected individually to create a customized hedge of specific portfolio risks these instruments are less liquid due to their customized nature  credit volatility arbitrage generally involves buying and selling options on credit spreads of individual companies or on traded indices an investment manager also may buy and sell volatility across various asset classes for example an investment manager may sell volatility via options on credit spreads and buy volatility on the same company via the equity markets directional credit  short directional credit  short involves shorting individual investmentgrade or highyield credits that exhibit either perceived anomalous pricing relative to similar credits or perceived weakening fundamentals with a high probability of credit deterioration the short position typically is established using cds in addition to using single name cds to short specific issuers an investment manager may also use specific indices such as the dow jones cdx suite of index products to short the overall investment grade market or specific sectors risk merger arbitrage risk arbitrage is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on perceived pricing discrepancies or spreads in the equity securities of two companies involved in announced corporate transactions such as mergers tender or exchange offers reorganizations liquidations and recapitalizations for merger transactions the strategy typically entails buying the security of the company being acquired while simultaneously selling short the security of the acquirer when a merger deal is pending uncertainty about the outcome typically creates a pricing disparity the stock of the target company typically sells at a discount to the expected acquisition price investment managers investing in merger arbitrage seek to capture the spread between the current stock price and the price upon the completion of the deal in a cashtender transaction the investment manager seeks to capture the spread between the tender price and the price at which the target companys stock is trading convertible arbitrage convertible arbitrage strategies include a variety of strategies involving investments in convertible securities that investment managers perceive to be undervalued from a fundamental or volatility perspective the primary convertible arbitrage strategies include but are not limited to long volatilitygamma trading catalysteventdriven investing credit sensitive investing and activist investing in general a position in each particular strategy involves taking a long position in convertible bonds or convertible preferred shares and short positions in the underlying common stock into which the convertible securities are exchangeable in order to isolate the aspect of the security that the investment manager believes is mispriced and largely eliminate the effect of directional moves in the underlying stock price long volatilitygamma trading primarily involves taking positions where the investment manager perceives that the volatility level implied by the price of the convertible security is too low relative to historical or expected future volatility of the security catalysteventdriven investing involves taking positions where the investment manager expects that a catalyst or event will cause the implied volatility of the convertible bonds or the actual volatility of stock price changes to increase such catalysts may include new product announcements litigation b pnst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st management changes or regulatory approval of a new drug the investment manager typically will seek to hedge interest rate and credit risk by using interest rate futures or swaps and credit derivatives credit sensitive investing involves taking positions where the investment manager expects that the financial condition of the underlying company will improve and credit spreads of the convertible bond will narrow the credit risk of such a position typically will be largely unhedged such a view may be based on improved trends in earnings refinancing of existing debt or the selling of assets activist investing relies on the ability of a manager with a significant economic stake in the equity debt convertible bond or other instruments of a company to influence management and corporate decisions in such a way as to increase the value of the holdings examples include seeking management changes corporate restructuring securing special dividends or other payments or the buying back of equity or debt statistical arbitrage statistical arbitrage is a strategy that seeks to exploit temporary price disparities among equity securities that historically have maintained stable price relationships the strategy uses quantitative models to determine which securities to purchase and which to sell short and to measure market exposure often these models rely upon fundamental balance sheet and income statement data such as earnings yield dividend yield revisions in earnings forecasts relationships between market capitalization revenues and net asset values earnings forecasts and price histories other approaches utilize factor analysis to measure factor risks and relative attractiveness investment managers that employ the strategy purchase and sell securities in relative quantities in a manner designed to result in an aggregate portfolio that is generally neutral to broad equity market movements andor to exposure across sectors investment style and market capitalization fixedincome arbitrage fixedincome arbitrage includes a variety of strategies involving investments in fixedincome instruments that are weighted in an attempt to eliminate or reduce exposure to changes in the level of interest rates these strategies attempt to exploit relative perceived mispricings ie anomalous yield differences between related sets of fixedincome securities the generic types of fixedincome arbitrage trades include the following yield curve arbitrage corporate versus government yield spreads or swap spreads municipal bond versus government yield spreads cash versus futures basis trades mortgages versus swaps and us treasuries mortgage derivative arbitrage and hedged abs opportunistic strategies opportunistic strategies refer to investment strategies with broad mandates to invest in a wide range of opportunities in debt equities nonus currencies physical commodities and derivatives in both developed and emerging markets globally opportunistic investment managers may establish both directional as well as hedged positions and typically use leverage in order to increase their invested positions strategies not pursued

with these investment guidelines among other things the adviser and grosvenor have established maximum exposure amounts for certain of the investment strategies in which the master fund may invest based in part on the outlook of grosvenors investment committee for the investment strategies the investment committee bases its outlook for particular strategies on its evaluation of the riskreward

whenever the master fund invests in or withdrawsredeems capital from an investment fund the master fund does so in accordance with the investment guidelines in effect at the time of such investment or

into compliance with the investment guidelines in an expeditious manner in certain cases the investment committee may recommend to the adviser that under the circumstances it is appropriate to modify an investment guideline or to adjust or refine the method or formula by which compliance with an investment guideline is tested resulting in the change of the status of the master fund from noncompliant to compliant the investment committee may also conclude and recommend to the adviser that under the circumstances it is appropriate for the master fund to continue to be noncompliant even

investment funds invest direct investments although direct investments may be made to recognize gains direct investments are typically i for hedging purposes involving the purchase or sale of securities or derivatives to reduce certain exposures of the master fund for example the purchase of puts on the sp  index and ii for cash management purposes for example the purchase of high quality fixed income securities money market instruments money market mutual funds or cash or cash equivalents direct investments are expected to be minimal in light of grosvenors focus on investing in investment funds restricted and illiquid investments although it is anticipated that most investment funds will invest primarily in publicly traded securities they generally may invest a portion of the value of their total assets in restricted securities and other investments which are illiquid restricted securities are securities that may not be sold to the public without an effective registration statement under the securities act or if they are unregistered may be sold only in a privately negotiated transaction or pursuant to an exemption from registration where registration is required to sell a security an investment fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the decision to sell and the time the investment manager may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such period adverse market conditions were to develop an investment fund might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to sell investment managers may be unable to sell restricted and other illiquid securities at the most opportune times or at prices approximating the value at which they purchased such securities in addition the master funds interests in unregistered investment funds are themselves illiquid and subject to substantial restrictions on transfer the master fund may liquidate an interest and withdraw from an unregistered investment fund pursuant to limited withdrawal rights the illiquidity of these interests may adversely affect the master fund were it to have to sell interests at an inopportune time borrowing the fund and the master fund are authorized to borrow the fund and the master fund may borrow money for certain purposes such as making payments to investment funds in accordance with the master funds investment commitments and paying fees and expenses of the fund and the master fund subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law the fund and the master fund expect to borrow money from time to time on a shortterm basis for liquidity purposes all interest and other fees charged under any line of credit will be paid by the fund or the master fund as applicable if the cash flows of the master fund are insufficient to meet required payments on this line of credit the master fund could be forced to liquidate investments in investment funds at times or in amounts that are not advantageous to the master fund incentive allocation each investment manager generally will receive performancebased allocations expected to range from  to  of net profits the performancebased allocation that will be received by an investment manager may create an incentive for the investment manager to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than those that might have been made in the absence of the performancebased b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th allocation in addition because the performancebased allocation will be calculated on a basis that includes realized and unrealized appreciation of an investment funds assets the performancebased allocation may be greater than if it were based solely on realized gains the fees and other expenses borne by the master fund including the performancebased allocations indirectly payable by the master fund as a result of its investments in investment funds are higher than those of other registered investment companies liquidity risks interests are not traded on any securities exchange or other market and are subject to substantial restrictions on transfer although the fund may offer to repurchase interests from time to time a member may not be able to liquidate its interest in the fund for an extended period of time the adviser expects that it will recommend to the board of directors that the fund offer to repurchase interests from members four times each year effective at the end of each calendar quarter distributions to members and payment of tax liability the fund does not intend to make periodic distributions of its net income or gains if any to members whether or not distributions are made members are required each year to pay applicable federal and state income taxes on their respective shares of the funds taxable income and will have to pay applicable taxes from other sources the amount and times of any distributions will be determined in the sole discretion of the board of directors special risks of multimanager structure the investment funds generally will not be registered as investment companies under the  act and therefore the fund as an indirect investor in these investment funds will not have the benefit of the protections afforded by the  act to investors in registered investment companies such as mutual funds although the adviser receives detailed information from each investment manager regarding its investment performance and investment strategy however the adviser may have little or no means of independently verifying this information an investment manager may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to the adviser which may involve risks that are not anticipated by the adviser the master fund relies primarily on information provided by investment managers in valuing its investments in investment funds and determining the value of interests and thus there is a risk that inaccurate valuations provided by investment managers could indirectly adversely affect the value of interests and the amounts members receive upon the repurchase of interests for the fund to complete its tax reporting requirements and to provide an audited annual report to members it must receive information on a timely basis from the master fund which in turn receives such information from the investment managers the investment managers delay in providing this information could delay the funds preparation of tax information for investors which might require members to seek extensions on the time to file their tax returns or could delay the preparation of the funds annual report an investor who meets the conditions imposed by the investment managers including minimum initial investment requirements that may be substantially higher than those imposed by the fund could invest directly with the investment managers by investing in the investment funds indirectly through the fund an investor bears a pro rata portion of the assetbased fee and other expenses of the fund a pro rata portion of the assetbased fees and other expenses of the master fund and also b pnst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st indirectly bears a pro rata portion of the assetbased fees performancebased allocations and other expenses borne by the master fund as an investor in investment funds each investment manager receives any performancebased allocations to which it is entitled irrespective of the performance of the other investment managers and the master fund generally accordingly an investment manager with positive performance may receive compensation from the master fund and thus indirectly from the investors in the fund even if the master funds overall returns are negative investment decisions of the investment funds are made by the investment managers independently of each other as a result at any particular time one investment fund may be purchasing shares of an issuer whose shares are being sold by another investment fund consequently the master fund could directly or indirectly incur certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result the master fund may make additional investments in or effect withdrawals from investment funds only at certain times pursuant to limitations set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds therefore the master fund may not be able to withdraw its investment in an investment fund promptly after it has made a decision to do so which may result in a loss to the master fund and adversely affect the funds investment return additionally the master fund from time to time may have to invest some of its assets temporarily in money market securities or subject to the limitations of the  act money market funds due to these limitations the master fund expects to hold nonvoting securities of an investment fund or irrevocably waive its right to vote some or all of its securities with respect to investment funds it will therefore not be able to vote on matters that require the approval of the investors in the investment fund including a matter that could adversely affect the master funds investment in the investment fund investment funds may be permitted to redeem their interests in kind thus upon the master funds withdrawal of all or a portion of its interest in an investment fund the master fund may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to value in the event the fund were to receive such securities from the master fund it would be required to dispose of such securities immediately either through liquidation or by distributing such securities to members in connection with a repurchase by the fund of all or a portion of interests of members a noncorporate investors share of the master funds investment expenses attributable to the fund including i assetbased fees at the master fund fund and the investment fund level and ii performancebased allocations at the investment fund level may be subject to certain limitations on deductibility for regular federal income tax purposes and may be completely disallowed for purposes of determining the noncorporate investors alternative minimum tax liability the master fund may agree to indemnify certain of the investment funds and their investment managers from any liability damage cost or expense arising out of among other things certain acts or omissions relating to the offer or sale of the interests other considerations other investors in the master fund may alone or collectively acquire sufficient voting interests in the master fund to control matters relating to the operation of the master fund if other investors control the master fund it could adversely affect the funds ability to meet repurchase requests which requires the cooperation of the master funds board of directors could result in a change to the master funds investment objectives or could have other adverse consequences to the fund as a result b pnnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd the fund could be required to withdraw its investment in the master fund or take other appropriate action any such withdrawal could result in an inkind distribution of securities as opposed to a cash distribution from the master fund if securities and other noncash assets are distributed the fund would incur brokerage tax or other charges in converting those assets to cash masterfeeder structures the fund does not invest directly in individual securities instead it invests substantially all of its investable assets in the master fund the master fund in turn purchases holds and sells investments in accordance with its investment objectives and policies the board of directors of the fund believes that the fees and expenses of the fund including its share of the fees and expenses of the master fund as an investor in the master fund will be less than or approximately equal to the expenses that the fund would incur if its assets were invested directly in securities and other investments the fund does not have the right to withdraw its investment in the master fund instead it may do so only through periodic repurchases by the master fund of its interests in the master fund this may limit the ability of the fund to make offers to repurchase interests in addition the fund may receive securities and other investments from the master fund in lieu of cash when it withdraws capital from the master fund the fund will incur expenses in liquidating investments received in connection with any inkind distributions a change in the investment objectives policies or restrictions of the master fund may cause the fund to seek to have

such other ventures will both compete with the master fund for the time and attention of grosvenor and its related persons and potentially create additional conflicts of interest or raise other

may make use of information obtained by them in the course of investing for the master fund grosvenor and its related persons will have no obligation to compensate the master fund in any respect for their receipt of such information or to account to the master fund for any profits earned from their use of such information grosvenor personnel may discuss investment ideas with portfolio managers at firms other than grosvenor such discussions may be mutually beneficial but may under certain circumstances benefit thirdparties with information developed in connection with operating the master fund and for which the master fund has paid to develop it is also possible that such discussions could ultimately prove to be detrimental to the master fund although grosvenor considers that possibility to be unlikely differences in grosvenormanaged accounts grosvenor and its related persons currently manage or advise numerous grosvenormanaged accounts in addition to the master fund and expect to manage or advise additional grosvenormanaged accounts in the future certain of the grosvenormanaged accounts have or will have investment objectives that are identical or substantially similar to those of the master fund it is not anticipated however that the master fund and other grosvenormanaged accounts having identical or substantially similar investment objectives will have identical or substantially similar investment portfolios differing investment portfolios can be expected to result from several factors including without limitation the following  different investment decisions made by the different grosvenor portfolio managers assigned to the different grosvenormanaged accounts  regulatory andor tax restrictions that apply to certain grosvenormanaged accounts but not to others  investment constraints imposed by the investment managers on certain grosvenormanaged accounts but not on others  the availability of particular investment funds for investment by grosvenormanaged accounts at certain times but not at others  different riskreturn characteristics notwithstanding that such grosvenormanaged accounts generally have similar investment objectives  clientimposed portfolio management restrictions andor other client instructions and  the amount of cash available for investment by different grosvenormanaged accounts at certain times as a result of factors such as these the master fund may have a different investment portfolio and as a result different performance results from other grosvenormanaged accounts even though the master fund and such other grosvenormanaged accounts may have identical or substantially similar investment objectives b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the master fund and other grosvenormanaged accounts may be managed by different grosvenor portfolio managers even though the master fund and such other grosvenormanaged accounts may have identical or substantially similar investment objectives grosvenor portfolio managers are authorized to invest the assets of the grosvenormanaged accounts for which they have investment responsibility in a wide range of investment funds as a result it is expected that the master fund and other grosvenormanaged accounts will have different investment portfolios resulting from different investment decisions made by their respective grosvenor portfolio managers even if they have identical or substantially similar investment objectives further the factors described above are likely to result in different portfolios for grosvenormanaged accounts that are managed by the same grosvenor portfolio managers even though such grosvenormanaged accounts have identical or substantially similar investment objectives regulatory andor tax restrictions may prohibit the master fund from participating in investment opportunities that are available to one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts for example certain grosvenor parties or their advisory clients including other grosvenormanaged accounts have fee sharing agreements with certain earlystage or startup investment management firms emerging managers pursuant to which they share in the fees revenues andor profits of such emerging managers in exchange for seeding the emerging managers operations also as discussed above grosvenor parties or their advisory clients including other grosvenormanaged accounts have invested or may invest in have entered into or may enter into fee sharing agreements with may operate andor may manage related investment management firms in certain cases arrangements with emerging managers or related investment management firms enable grosvenor parties and their advisory clients to invest in investment funds sponsored by such emerging managers or related investment management firms on terms that are more favorable than those otherwise available to clients of such emerging managers or related investment management firms grosvenor does not intend to cause the master fund to enter into fee sharing agreements with emerging managers or related investment management firms grosvenor does not intend to allocate the master funds assets to any emerging manager or related investment management firm in which any of the grosvenor parties has an investment or with whom any of grosvenor parties has a fee sharing agreement similarly the investment managers of the investment funds in which the master fund wishes to invest may impose investment restrictions on the master fund but not on other grosvenormanaged accounts such restrictions could render the master fund ineligible to invest in whole or in part in an investment fund in which one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts are free to invest to the possible detriment of the master fund multiple grosvenormanaged accounts investing in the same investment fund a number of different grosvenormanaged accounts and persons associated with grosvenor may invest or be invested in the same investment fund at the same time although such parties may have made their respective investments in such investment fund at different times and accordingly may experience different investment results in connection with such investments the ability of these different grosvenormanaged accounts and persons associated with grosvenor to withdrawredeem from such investment fund may differ materially due to the timing of their respective investments in such investment fund the different classes of interest in such investment fund in which they invest special arrangements negotiated with the investment manager of such investment fund andor other factors the reasons why the various different grosvenormanaged accounts or persons associated with grosvenor may wish or be compelled to withdrawredeem from a particular investment fund also may differ materially similarly the ability of the grosvenormanaged accounts or persons associated with grosvenor to invest in a particular investment fund also may differ materially b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th withdrawalsredemptions or subscriptions by one or more grosvenormanaged accounts andor by persons associated with grosvenor from or to a particular investment fund could in certain cases adversely affect other grosvenormanaged accounts that are invested in such investment fund significant withdrawalsredemptions or subscriptions could for example cause portfolio damage portfolio dilution depletion of liquidity costly portfolio rebalancings imposition of withdrawal gates and underallocation to certain positions in cases such as these grosvenor would have a conflict of interest in making withdrawalsredemptions or subscriptions for the grosvenormanaged accounts this conflict of interest could be exacerbated in situations where one or more grosvenormanaged accounts may withdrawredeem from a particular investment fund as of a date as of which one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts are not able to do so for example certain grosvenormanaged accounts may have invested in a particular investment fund pursuant to a lockup that has expired whereas one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts may still be subject to lockups in connection with their investments in such investment fund because they either i purchased their interests in such investment fund subsequent to the time that such other grosvenormanaged accounts purchased their interests in such investment fund or ii opted for liquidity classes in such investment fund that are different from the liquidity classes owned by such grosvenormanaged accounts in addition certain withdrawalredemption gates are for example calculated based on withdrawalsredemptions during an entire quarter or other period so that one or more grosvenormanaged accounts withdrawalsredemptions andor those of persons associated with grosvenor during a quarter could cause the gate to prevent one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts withdrawingredeeming at quarterend whereas the earlier withdrawalsredemptions are unaffected alternatively certain grosvenormanaged accounts may not be in a position to invest in an investment funddue to lack of available cash position concentration limits or other reasonsat the same time that other grosvenormanaged accounts andor persons associated with grosvenor are able to do so perhaps at a net asset value that grosvenor believes is attractive from an investment standpoint grosvenors management of one or more grosvenormanaged accounts investments in a particular investment fund could be adversely affected by grosvenors decisionmaking with respect to one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts that are also invested in such investment fund aggregation of grosvenormanaged accounts in certain cases investment funds may permit grosvenor to aggregate some or all of the grosvenormanaged accounts invested in such investment fund ie all investments made by such grosvenormanaged accounts will be treated as if they had been made by the same investor under arrangements such as these certain grosvenormanaged accounts could make complete withdrawalsredemptions under an individual investor gate provided that other grosvenormanaged accounts did not withdrawredeem as the former grosvenormanaged accounts could make use of the withdrawalredemption capacity allocable to the entire aggregation group grosvenor thus has a conflict of interest in allocating gate capacity and other investment attributes among the grosvenormanaged accounts included in the same aggregation group for example if a grosvenormanaged account that is part of an aggregation group were to receive significant withdrawalredemption requests require liquidity for other reasons or rebalance its portfolio it could withdrawredeem from an aggregate investment and reduce withdrawalredemption capacity for other members of the aggregate group in the case of certain investment funds grosvenor is able to negotiate favorable business terms with their investment managers but often on the condition that the grosvenormanaged accounts collectively maintain an aggregate minimum level of invested capital ie capital invested by all grosvenormanaged accounts in a given investment fund or group of investment funds managed by b pnth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th the same investment manager the need to maintain an aggregate minimum investment by all grosvenormanaged accounts in a particular investment fund or group of investment funds managed by the same investment manager in order to retain favorable business terms for all grosvenormanaged accounts that invest in such investment funds creates a conflict of interest in that it creates an incentive for grosvenor to cause a grosvenormanaged account to invest in or not to withdrawredeem from a given investment fund or instead of withdrawingredeeming to transfer an interest in such investment fund to another grosvenormanaged account which might not otherwise have invested in such investment fund in order to maintain the minimum threshold investment grosvenor proprietary capitalwhether invested directly in an investment fund or through a grosvenormanaged accountmay be among the capital which benefits from the minimum investment threshold being maintained creating an additional conflict of interest transfers of interests in investment funds the grosvenor portfolio managers for one or more grosvenormanaged accounts each a divesting account may determine that it is appropriate for such divesting accounts to dispose of or decrease their investments in a particular investment fund as of a particular date while the grosvenor portfolio managers for one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts each an investing account may determine that it is appropriate for such investing accounts to invest or increase their investments in such investment fund as of the same date in certain cases grosvenor will implement decisions such as these by causing a divesting account to withdrawredeem its interest from an investment fund at the net asset value thereof as calculated and reported by the investment manager of such investment fund and simultaneously causing an investing account to invest in an interest in such investment fund at the net asset value thereof in other cases grosvenor will implement such decisions by causing a divesting account to assign its interest in an investment fund to an investing account in exchange for a cash payment from the investing account equal to the reported net asset value if the interest being assigned to the investing account as calculated and reported by the investment manager of such investment fund for purposes of convenience  grosvenor refers to transactions of the types described above as transfers even though the first types of transactions described above do not involve any transfer between the affected grosvenormanaged accounts but only a divestment from an investment fund by one or more grosvenormanaged accounts and a substantially simultaneous investment in such investment fund by one or more other grosvenormanaged accounts  grosvenor refers to a transaction in which a divesting account withdrawsredeems its interest from an investment fund in whole or in part at the net asset value thereof while an investing account substantially simultaneously invests or increases its investment in such investment fund as a cash transfer and  grosvenor refers to a transaction in which a divesting account assigns its interest in an investment fund in whole or in part at the net asset value thereof to an investing account as a book entry transfer in no instance does any party including grosvenor or the investment manager of any affected investment fund receive any additional compensation specifically as a result of any cash transfer or book entry transfer however the practice of engaging in cash transfers could create certain risks for investorsparticipants in affected grosvenormanaged accounts b pnst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st for example in certain cases grosvenor is able to negotiate arrangements with investment managerseither at the inception of grosvenors relationship with an investment manager or on a casebycase basis after grosvenor has established such a relationshipthat permit a grosvenormanaged account that is the cash transferee of an interest in such investment managers investment fund to stand in the shoes of the transferor grosvenormanaged account for purposes of determining such business terms as the duration of any lockup period the continuation of any performanceincentive fee or other performanceincentive compensation loss carryforwards the applicability of withdrawal charges etc grosvenor generally intends to take advantage to the fullest extent permitted by law of the ability of transferee grosvenormanaged accounts to receive carryover business terms in certain cases however regulatory considerations may prohibit grosvenor from effecting transactions in which business terms are carried over from the transferor grosvenormanaged account to the transferee grosvenormanaged account for example the us employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa does not permit any such carryover business terms to apply in the case of transfers of interests in investment funds by grosvenormanaged accounts that are subject to erisa to any other grosvenormanaged accounts regardless of whether the transferee grosvenormanaged accounts are subject to erisa erisa however does not appear to prohibit carryover business terms applying in the case of transfers from grosvenormanaged

particular investment fund if the fee structure of a particular grosvenormanaged account is more favorable to grosvenor than the fee structure of another grosvenormanaged account the ability to cause such grosvenormanaged accounts to participate in carryover transfers of interests in such investment fund creates an incentive for grosvenor to cause the account having an unfavorable fee structure to

grosvenormanaged accounts these policies and procedures are summarized in schedule f of part ii of grosvenors sec form adv trade and clerical errors subject to the considerations set forth below grosvenor is under no obligation to reimburse the master fund for any errors or mistakes made by grosvenor its employees or agents with respect to grosvenors placing or executing trades for the master fund or for any other administrative or clerical errors or mistakes made by the foregoing collectively trade or clerical errors as grosvenor considers such errors and mistakes to be a cost of doing business however pursuant to the standard of care provisions of the governing documents of the master fund grosvenor will be obligated to reimburse the master fund for losses sustained by the master fund as a result of any trade or clerical error that is caused by grosvenors failure to adhere to the standard of care set forth in such provisions grosvenor subject to its fiduciary obligations will determine i whether or not any trade or clerical error is required to be reimbursed in accordance with such standard of care provisions and ii if so the extent of the loss that has been incurred by the master fund grosvenor has an inherent conflict of interest with respect to determining whether or not a trade or clerical error is required to be reimbursed in accordance with the applicable standard of care provisions and with respect to determining the extent of the loss that has been incurred by the master fund if a trade or clerical error occurs other than as a result of grosvenors failure to adhere to the applicable standard of care grosvenor in its sole discretion reserves the right to reimburse the master fund for any losses sustained by the master fund as a result of such trade or clerical error grosvenors reimbursement of the master fund for a trade or clerical error in such a situation will not constitute a waiver of grosvenors general policy to cause the master fund to bear the losses associated with other trade or clerical errors that occur other than as a result of grosvenors failure to adhere to the applicable standard of care any net gain resulting from trade or clerical errors will be for the benefit of the master fund and will not be retained by grosvenor other considerations grosvenor ordinarily will not cause the master fund to incur brokerage commissions in connection with its investments in investment funds which are and are expected to continue to be the primary focus of the master funds investment activities however grosvenor may from time to time cause the master fund to i engage in limited hedging transactions ii make direct investments andor iii invest in bank demand deposit accounts andor highquality shortterm instruments that

intermediaries in connection with such transactions grosvenor will negotiate such compensation on a casebycase basis and will not seek to obtain products research or services other than transactional services from such intermediaries certain of the investment funds in which the master fund invests may hold notes or other securities issued from time to time by grosvenor and grosvenor may be aware that such investment funds do so the fact that certain investment funds may hold notes or other securities issued by grosvenor could under certain facts and circumstances potentially alter grosvenors objectivity in determining whether or not to invest in such investment funds andor whether or not to withdrawredeem from such investment funds grosvenor however does not expect that it would ever make portfolio management decisions for the master fund that would be different from the decisions it would make for the master fund if such potential conflict did not exist grosvenor and its principals and the investment managers and their principals may engage in philanthropic activities through contributions of their time andor financial resources to charitable organizations grosvenor and its

however consultants and financial advisors have from time to time invited grosvenor and its principals to participate in particular philanthropic activities and can be expected to continue to do so in the future grosvenor has participated in such philanthropic activities in the past and can be expected to continue to do so in the future under no circumstances will such participation or lack thereof be a factor in grosvenors investment management process grosvenor from time to time provides meals and entertainment to persons associated with consultants financial advisors clients and prospective

firm that provides services to grosvenor for compensation from grosvenor discloses that fact to all clients to whom it recommends grosvenor persons associated with grosvenor may be related by blood or

persons associated with grosvenor such persons may have an incentive to select grosvenor as a potential manager of the assets of clients of such consulting firms to recommend grosvenor to clients of such consulting firms andor to recommend that clients of such consulting firms continue to utilize grosvenors services grosvenor believes that is the responsibility of consulting firms to recuse interested individuals or take other appropriate steps to protect the integrity of their decisionmaking processes and to make appropriate disclosures of potential conflicts of interest to their clients grosvenor urges prospective investors who utilize the services of consulting firms to inquire of such consulting firms whether they are subject to such a conflict of interest grosvenors fiduciary duties grosvenor has fiduciary duties to the master fund to act in good faith and with fairness in all its dealings with the master fund grosvenor will take such duties into account in dealing with all actual and potential conflicts of interest the investment managers the investment managers are likely to be subject to many of the same types of conflicts of interest to which grosvenor is subject for example the investment managers may be involved in other business ventures including the management andor administration of other investment funds and accounts whose investment objectives are identical or substantially similar to those of the investment funds the master fund will not share in the risks or rewards of such other ventures in addition such other ventures will compete with the relevant investment funds for the time and attention of the relevant investment managers and might create additional conflicts of interest or raise other special

including other accounts in which they may have an interest and may have financial and other incentives to favor such accounts over the investment funds in which the master fund invests in investing on behalf of other clients as well as the investment funds in which the master fund invests the investment managers must allocate their resources as well as limited market opportunities doing so could increase the level of competition for the same trades that otherwise might be made for the investment funds in which the master fund invests including the priorities of order entry as well as make it difficult or impossible to take or liquidate a particular position at a price indicated by an investment managers strategy in addition in connection with investing and trading for other accounts
