conference call may    pm et executives haig bagerdjian  chairman president and ceo john schweizer  vice president controller analysts operator good day everyone and welcome to today’s quarterly shareholder conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the questionandanswer session operator instructions please note this call may be recorded i’ll be standing by if you should need any assistance it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to haig bagerdjian please go ahead sir your line is open haig bagerdjian thank you good morning and thanks for joining us today with me is john schweizer our vice president and controller before we answer any questions you may have regarding the press release i will ask john to discuss forwardlooking statements and to briefly review the numbers that were given this morning in our press release after i will make few comments and we will open the lines for questions john john schweizer hi good morning and thanks haig certain statements in this conference call may contain forwardlooking statements concerning the company’s projected revenues earnings and cash flow the planned focus on internal and external growth new markets sales initiatives steps to reduce costs and improving customer service and new business such statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to be materially different from those expected or anticipated in the forwardlooking statements in addition to the factors described in the company’s sec filings the following among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this conference lower than expected new sales operating income and earnings less than expected growth actions of competitors including business combinations technological breakthroughs new product offerings and promotional successes the risks that anticipated new business may not occur or will be delayed and general economic conditions that may be adversely impacted – impacting our business hopefully you’ve all seen the press release so i’ll mention only a few items revenues for the third quarter were  million compared to  million in last years quarter for the nine months ended march   revenues were  million compared to  million last year our third quarter’s gross margin was  of sales sga expenses were about  million we also recorded a  million impairment charge associated with the companys abandonment of the movie q business in the nine month period total operating costs have been reduced by  when compared to the same period last year just sort of reminder that with respect to the unusual gain and last year’s nine month period other income included  million which represented the  million difference between the aggregate fair values assigned to the purchased assets of modern videofilm inc and the fair value of the common shares and the warrants given as consideration for the purchase net of a  million deferred income tax benefit recorded in connection with the recognition of the gain haig haig bagerdjian thank you john and in the past i will keep my comments brief to allow more time to answer your questions as john mentioned our revenues were at  million in third quarter of fiscal  compared to  million in the last years third quarter while third quarter revenues represent an increase over the quarter ended december  ’ nine months revenues were lower than expected due to one customer taking a portion of their business back inhouse and loss of some future cost to the competition we just ended third quarter we have seen increase in our localization specialized quality control and tv post we are continuing to consolidate services among our two facilities to attract additional business we also closed down our movie q business at the end of the most recent quarter as the remaining as the remaining two store leases expired we believe those moves will further contribute to the bottom line we are still experiencing pressure on our cash resources and continue to adjust our cost structure total operating costs have been reduced by  million in the first nine months of the current fiscal year when compared to last year this includes  reduction in our operating costs operator i would like to address any questions that the conference participants have so please open the lines questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we do have a question from stephen lobo please go ahead your line is open unidentified analyst hello hi good morning alan steel was with your company for many years and i’ve listened to you and alan many times in the conference calls what was the reason for his departure haig bagerdjian he’s desire to retire alan being with us long time and he is employed as a consultant we are very  how i say respectful of his decision and saddened that you know he decided to spend more time with his aging mother but alan has been you know one of the keystones of our continued operations and control and management of the finances so john is a steady hand john being with the company for a long time and hes being you know in the training program so to speak to become our ceo and i think you know we are moving in that direction unfortunately that succession planning has to be altered just because as i indicated alan decided to expedite his retirement even though hed been the retirement age for the last two years he was still part of the organization training and advising counselling john to take the helm to speak so john is our succession planning person and we will not be doing an external search for that job but rather keep flowing ph alan in a capacity of consultant and arming john with the capabilities that he needs to assume that role so nothing in a way of disagreement or help whether age and the desire to spend more time with his ailing mother she happened to be over  years old so unidentified analyst okay thanks a lot post modern acquisition the balance sheet has weakened the gross margin have maybe used and losses are mounting and it looks like you are in punch ph situation right now how confident are you for weathering this tough period haig bagerdjian we are tight but optimistic and have a game plan we are executing the game plan as indicated we have reduced our booking costs by  and we are doing things that are you know basically got a dual throng approach we are hiring capable people that are effective in attracting new businesses to replace the businesses that are either unprofitable abandoned or that are highly competitive and lower margin or simply competition can outbid us you know and outperform in a sense as either because they are global player or they use a particular service as a loss leader in order to attract a bigger package so for those reasons we are investing on one hand on the other hand we are looking ways to reduce the cash burn or negative margins and doing that weve been able to stabilize the business and increase the revenues we had an incredibly difficult time in this previous quarter as i indicated in our previous phone call november and december of  were challenging because either a decision by competitors to postpone or not do certain services with us we saw revenues really dip in at   you know level per month and that obviously created humongous negative burn we have somewhat recovered in the quarter we just reported we saw numbers go up about two and you know in the month of march were about two to four so you know it has been a recovery we are seeing a decent growth in our localization our tv post and our highend qc and we have every indications to count on the growth of it obviously its a balancing act trying to see and optimize our operating costs at the same time find ways to invest in the areas that we see highest probability of growth and margin expansion so you know by no means it is easy task but we believe that we have the game plan and methods to be able to achieve both and thats where we need to and reduce cost where we have to and a combination of those two should be able to put us in a better life than we are today unidentified analyst thanks haig those were the questions i had and all the best for the upcoming quarters thank you haig bagerdjian thank you operator operator instructions and it appears we have no further questions at this time haig bagerdjian so thank you all the participants that are on the line but not asking questions and thank you for asking questions double thank you because more questions you ask more we’ll be able to give you the color on the numbers but we are looking forward talking to you in the near future when we have other events to report or quarterly reporting again so thank you and have a wonderful day john schweizer thanks have a good day haig bagerdjian operator
