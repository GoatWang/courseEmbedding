assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates certain of the company’s estimates could be affected by external conditions including those unique to its industry and general economic conditions it is possible that these external factors could have an effect on the company’s estimates that could cause actual results to differ from its estimates the company reevaluates all of its accounting estimates at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary                cash   the company considers all shortterm highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents   revenue recognition   the company follows the guidance of the accounting standards codification “asc” topic  “revenue recognition” we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product delivery has occurred the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured the company has not experienced any significant returns from customers and accordingly in management’s opinion no reserve for returns has been provided   inventories   inventories which consist of the company’s product held for resale are stated at the lower of cost determined using the firstin firstout and net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to complete and dispose of the product   if the company identifies excess obsolete or unsalable items its inventories are written down to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified  shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of sales in the companys statements of operations   fair value measurements   the company adopted the provisions of asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements   the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments the carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations which include contractual interest rates are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions                the company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis   stockbased compensation   the company recognizes compensation expense for stockbased compensation in accordance with asc topic  for employee stockbased awards the fair value of the award is calculated on the date of grant using the blackscholes method for stock options and the quoted price of our common stock for common shares the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest for nonemployee stockbased awards the fair value of the award on the date of grant is calculated in the same manner as employee awards however the awards are revalued at the end of each reporting period and the pro rata compensation expense is adjusted accordingly until such time the nonemployee award is fully vested at which time the total compensation recognized to date equals the fair value of the stockbased award as calculated on the measurement date which is the date at which the award recipient’s performance is complete the estimation of stockbased awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised   advertising   advertising and marketing expenses are charged to operations as incurred   income taxes   the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of i taxes payable or refundable for the current year and ii deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized    asc topic  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
