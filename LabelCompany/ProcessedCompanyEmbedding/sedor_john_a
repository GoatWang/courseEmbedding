turn the call over to john sedor please go ahead sir john sedor thank you isaac good afternoon and thank you for joining us today im pleased to have the opportunity to review pernixs continued progress with you from a comparison standpoint due to the seasonality of our business from quarter four to quarter one a sequential comparison is not a true indicator of our business and how it performed during the quarter therefore im going to focus my remarks on a yearoveryear comparison of our business with that lets take a look at our performance in the first quarter we continue to be pleased with the trajectory of our business prescription volumes of treximet and silenor were in line with our expectations for the quarter while volumes of zohydro er did not meet our expectations largely due to the impact of the  milligram back order which we will discuss later on the call total prescriptions for treximet was down less than  in the first quarter of  as compared to the corresponding period of  this is an indication indicative of the reversal of the five year downward trend the product has seen through mid  additionally we achieved yearoveryear growth of  and  in prescription volumes for silenor and zohydro er with beadtek respectively importantly driven by the restructuring of our sales force which we executed in july of last year we saw a  decrease in sga expenses yearoveryear adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  improved to a loss of  in the first quarter of  thats compared to a loss of  million in the first quarter of  i earlier mentioned the back order of the  milligram zohydro er let me now provide you with an update on the availability of this trend as we announced earlier this month due to manufacturing issues with our supplier we now expect it to  milligram strength will be on back order until at least the first quarter of  since that time pernix has and will continue to market and distribute other trends of zohydro er with beadtek including the  milligram  milligram  milligram  milligram and  milligrams strength pernix continues to work directly with the wholesalers and prescribers to minimize any distraction  disruption caused by the stock and with our supplier to ensure that zohydro  milligram strength shrimp to the market place to return it to the marketplace as soon as possible for our utilization of the  milligram  milligram and  milligrams strength of zohydro er with beadtek are expected to increase in order to fulfil the patient’s need the company anticipates that the temporary stockup will impact the overall zohydro er with beadtek prescriptions volume and growth pernix is currently evaluating the scope of the impact and will provide further updates as appropriate now with that let me turn the call over to george jones our vice president of sales and marketing to discuss our commercial progress george jones thank you john the first quarter is typically soft for most of the pharmaceutical industry due to changes in patients insurance deductible resets and a higher overall out of pocket costs for patients relative to the fourth quarter in addition we continue to operate in a challenging manage market environment for branded products understanding that our business remains headed in the right direction we remain focused on the highest volume prescribers we believe have the greatest potential for growth our prescription performance for treximet and silenor during the first quarter was largely in line with our expectations and we continue to be pleased with our results as john stated two three of our core brands zohydro er and silenor achieved yearoveryear growth in quarterly total prescriptions and treximet although down slightly outperformed some of our key branded competitors reviewing the first quarter of  performances each of our each of our core brands in greater detail treximet prescriptions decreased by less than  yearonyear in an opioid market place that continues to be challenging and the same sort of back order of the  milligram strength of zohydro er the total prescriptions for zohydro er with beadtek grew  yearoveryear in the first quarter  i believe that products continues to be well positioned in the opioid market with the  strengths of zohydro er we have available because they offer prescribers a wide range of dosing options and flexibility four of these five strengths fall below the morphine milligram equivalents that are suggested by the cdc guidelines for opiod prescribing in chronic pain that were published in march of  in regards to silenor prescriptions we delivered yearoveryear growth of  versus first quarter of  we are looking to really reaccelerate the growth in silenor moving forward with the initiatives that weve recently begun to execute including the addition of  high potential sleep prescribers to our pain team target list who will receive first position calls as well as increased incentive compensation waiting for our pain sales force we are confident that the increased focus on qualified sleep prescribers will lead to increased growth for silenor taking a closer look at our prescription trends the field force optimization previously implemented and use to have a positive impact on our business youll recall that in the third quarter and first  fourth quarters in  we saw an increase in the call frequency towards top prescribers as well as in the average cost per day this continued in the first quarter of  and the impact of our efforts has been translated into higher prescribing and market share for our products overall and more specifically within our targets for treximet first quarter market share was  within our target this is up  versus q  total prescriptions in our targets increased by  in q  over q  for zohydro and beadtek first quarter market share was approximately  which was up  over q  as mentioned earlier in the call the opioid market continues to be under pressure declining  within our targets in q  versus same period in  finally silenor market share was  up  versus q  we were also pleased to report continued strong uptake of the pernix prescriptions direct program our prescription fulfilment program ppd continues to gain traction as more patients utilize the program with prescriptions for treximet and silenor increasing by more than a  compared to the first quarter  the continued rapid growth of ppd during the first quarter contributed to the improving prescriptions trends across our portfolio and allowed us to mitigate some of the typical q impact for our brands we expect this trend to continue a  move forward as evidence of this as i mentioned earlier ppd as a percentage of total prescriptions has reached  in recent weeks for treximet which compares to the  we reported on our fourth quarter call the filed pilots for ppd for zohydro er has been completed and due to the positive results we are currently in a process of a full scale rollout finally as we execute our commercial plan we completed our speaker training programs for all three brands in q and have begun to ramp up our investment in peer education through q and into q  we are very pleased with the progress our commercial team has continued to achieve to begin  i look forward to continuing the positive momentum throughout the year i will now turn the call over to our presidents and cfo graham miao for his review of the financials graham graham miao thank you george good afternoon everyone i will now discuss our overall financial results for the first quarter of  the sales performance of our core brands and operating results i will then address our balance sheet and liquidity in further detail during the first quarter of  net revenues for the company were  a decrease of  yearonyear from  million in the first quarter of  the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower net price for all of our core brands and the lower shipped volume for treximet and the zohydro er now let me look at  lets look at the specifics for each major product for treximet net revenues decreased by  million or  compared to the first quarter of  gross to net for the first quarter were  down from  percent in the prior year period the decrease in gross to net yearoveryear is due primarily to higher managed care rebates in the payer mix as well as an increase in copay coupon deductions for the four year  we expect gross to net for treximet to improve to the low s for silenor first quarter  net sales were down slightly as compared to the first quarter of  gross to net for the first quarter were  down from  in the prior year period the decrease in gross to net was due primarily to the higher managed care rebates for full year  we expect gross to net for silenor to be in the low to mid s an improvement from  in  for zohydro er net sales decreased by  million or  during the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  gross to net for the first quarter were  down from  in the prior year the decreasing gross to net was due to reductions across a variety of categories for full year  we expect gross to net for zohydro er to be in the low s gross margin for the company in the first quarter of  was a  up from  in the first quarter of  due primarily to product mix and a discontinuation of certain low margin products sga expense decreased by  million or  during the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   the decrease was driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expenses as a result of the initiative we implemented to restructure our sales force in operations last july we expect full year sga expense for  to be lower than  as a result of the annualized benefit of these restructuring initiatives rd expense for the first quarter of  was  million compared to  million in the prior year period the decrease was related to the lower spend for treximet first quarter  adjusted ebitda was a loss of  million a significant improvement from a loss of  million in the first quarter of  now let me turn to our financial condition as john stated we continue to work to improve our financial flexibility and strengthen our balance sheet we recently amended our credit facility with wells fargo and we intend to transition to another financing source on or before july st  additional details of the amended agreement are available in our k filed on april th  we have engaged in discussions with parties that have expressed interest in refinancing the revolving credit facility as of march   the company had a total cash balance of  million total principal amount of debt outstanding at march   was approximately  million and net debt was  million the total principal amount of debt consisted of approximately  million of  senior secured notes  million of  convertible notes and a  million under our revolving credit facility as discussed on previous calls we continue to analyze various alternatives in order to proactively address our liquidity and a capital structure in a constructive manner including strategic and the refinancing alternatives asset sales and mergers and acquisitions i will now turn the call back to john sedor john john sedor thank you graham let me conclude the changes that we implement in july  have led to stable or improving prescription trends for our three core brands as well as a reduced cost structure in the face of having to navigate through a seasonally change  challenging quarter our performance in the first quarter indicates to us that our commercial team is really beginning to hit its stride operating within the new structure i am pleased with the progress weve achieved with prescriptions and truly believe that our business is making great progress we also remain focused on further improvements to our capital structure we will keep you updated on our progress through  with that i will now turn the call over to isaac to open up the line for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from patrick dolezal with lifesci capital patrick dolezal i just have a couple of questions here so what do you attribute the growth of ppd to and also why doesn’t silenor have the same percentage of prescriptions going through ppd as treximet does george jones ill take that call or that question this is george jones vice president of sales and marketing good question patrick and for us the growth of ppd we believe can be attributed to the fact that really weve put together a world class program and the feedback that weve been getting from the prescribers that use the program has largely been positive and their experience when they send the patients prescriptions to our ppd program positive leading to increased penetration increased use of the program regarding silenor with treximet its a largely a commercially insured patient base silenor for sleep medicines the mix is more towards medicare part d and we know that you cannot send government insured patients into a program like ppd youre going to get less penetration of the program for a product like silenor than you will for a product like treximet patrick dolezal great thank you george jones thank you operator operator instructions and it appears theres no further questions over the phone at this time john sedor okay thank you isaac and that concludes our first quarter call operator once again this concludes todays call thank you for your participation you may

thank you lorie good afternoon and thank you for joining us today i am pleased to have the opportunity to review pernixs continued progress with you i am going to focus the majority of my remarks on the sequential improvement of our business since the beginning of  especially since we restructured our sales force in july since that time our story has been one of commercial execution quite simply weve achieved more with less our efforts have produced improvement in both top and bottom line in the fourth quarter adjusted net revenue increased  over the third quarter importantly during the fourth quarter total prescription volumes increased yearoveryear for all three core brands treximet zohydro er with beadtek and silenor in addition adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of  improved by  to approximately  million as compared to  million in the third quarter of  and a loss of  million in the second quarter of  these numbers exclude the impact of the gsk arbitration award which we will discuss later in this call we are pleased with the performance of each our core brands of note the fourth quarter treximet prescriptions increased by  sequentially as compared to the third quarter of  and  compared to the fourth quarter of  in addition silenor and zohydro er prescriptions increased  and  yearoveryear versus quarter four  respectively for full year  treximet prescriptions declined  compared to  a significant improvement from the decline we saw in prior years silenor and zohydro er prescriptions increased  and  over  moving on we remained focused on identifying potential actions that we might implement in order to improve our financial flexibility and strengthened our balance sheet while we are unable to reach an agreement with creditors that was in the best interest of our stakeholders in  we continue to evaluate various alternatives that might proactively address our liquidity and capital structure in a constructive manner including strategic and refinancing alternatives asset sales and mergers and acquisitions importantly weve already executed on certain initiatives including regaining compliance with nasdaq listing requirements and the appointment of dr graham miao dr dennis langar and gabriel leung to the companys board of directors in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of  we are pleased to have recently received a favorable opinion in our litigation with actavis laboratories regarding proposed generic versions of zohydro er the court ruled that actavis proposed generic version of zohydro er infringed two patents that cover zohydro er this ruling follows a trial that took place in october of  the judge in the case entered an order enjoining actavis from engaging in the commercial manufacturing use offer to sell or sale in the united states of actavis and their product prior to the expiration of the two patents we believe that this decision confirms the strength and longevity of zohydro er patent portfolio while actavis recently submitted a notice of appeal of the decision we remain confident that the district court decision will be affirmed in addition weve continued to assess opportunities to improve the abusedeterrent properties of zohydro er such as licensing of innovative technologies and reformulation before i turn the call over to george jones for a commercial update id like to review the companys arbitration with gsk as a reminder pernix and gsk have been in arbitration regarding claims date related to the treximet asset purchase and supply agreement on january   the arbitration tribunal issued opinions in favor of gsk awarding it damages and fees in the amount of approximately  million plus interest the tribunal also denied pernix’s claim that gsk breached its obligations under the supply agreement pernix has already paid gsk  million which will offset the total award on march   we are able to negotiate a final settlement of this matter with gsk by entering into an amendment interim settlement agreement between pernix and gsk the amendment establishes a payment schedule for satisfaction of the balance of the award granted to gsk in the arbitration pernix and gsk have agreed that the outstanding balance of the award is  million and that pernix will pay the award in quarterly installment in amounts totaling  million in   million in  and  million in  graham will review the financial impact in greater detail later in this call with that let me now turn the call over to george jones our vice president of sales and marketing to discuss our commercial progress george jones thank you john as a result of our field force reorganization in mid  we now have one fully integrated sales management team and a national sales force with representatives focusing on either zohydro er with beadtek or treximet as their primary products every representative also promotes silenor as a secondary product our sales representatives remain focused on the highest volume prescribers who have the greatest potential for growth for the second consecutive quarters weve experienced positive commercial result with their recently optimized more focused sales model as john stated similar to the third quarter the fourth quarter also saw yearoveryear growth in quarterly total prescriptions for each of treximet zohydro er with beadtek and silenor reviewing the fourth quarter performance of each our core products in greater detail treximet prescriptions increased by  sequentially compared to the third quarter of  yearoveryear total treximet prescriptions increased by  compared to the fourth quarter of  this is the second consecutive quarter that weve seen yearoveryear growth for four quarter this is consistent with the improving trend weve seen over the past seven quarters and a significant improvement from the  yearoveryear declines when we purchased the product in  longer term we continue to proactively plan for the emergence of generic versions of treximet in the marketplace in  we expect to launch our own authorized generic in february  as previously stated we expect to retain significant market share through continued sales of the brand as well as the introduction of our authorized generic it is worth noting that our ppd program is now responsible for approximately  of treximet prescription so we anticipate that this will be a key platform for us to transition patient to our authorized generic in a challenging opioid marketplace total prescription of zohydro er with beadtek grew  sequentially in the fourth quarter of  from the third quarter of  and total prescriptions were up a solid  yearoveryear we continue to focus on a core messages that we believe differentiate zohydro er in the product pay market those are true  hour pain control with no evidence of that endofdose failure simple onetoone conversion from ir hydrocodone as well as no adjustments in start dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment as a result of the sales force realignment silenor prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  decreased slightly sequentially from the third quarter of  however we delivered yearoveryear growth of  versus the fourth quarter of  we are rolling out a number of initiatives to support the reacceleration of silenor growth including the addition of high potential prescribers to our target list and increased incentive compensation leading for our pain sales force we are confident that this increased focus on qualified sleep prescribers will lead to increase growth for silenor finally weve recently secured a more favorable rebate agreement with an important managed care plan that improves growth finance for silenor going forward looking ahead we believe silenor is a good candidate for an otc conversion weve already received increased from multiple large cap global pharmaceuticals companies interested in discussing this possibility with us as we continue to focus on lifecycle management and to maximize the long term prospects of this brand taking a closer look at our prescription trends the field force optimization previously implemented continues to have a positive impact on our business youll recall that in the third quarter we saw an increase in the call frequency towards to our top prescribers as well as in the average cost per day this continued in the fourth quarter and the impact of our efforts has translated into higher prescribing and market share for our product overall and more specifically within our targets for treximet we ended  with market share of  within our targets this is up  versus january of  zohydro er with beadtek we ended the year with  market share which was up  over january  and silenor was at  which was up  versus january  the number of healthcare professionals prescribing our brands at least once a week was up for all three of our brands in q of  versus q of  this continues the trends that we reported on our last earnings call we believe this demonstrates that our increased call frequency is having a positive impact on healthcare professionals and their comfort level prescribing our product more in their daytoday clinical practice we are also pleased to report continued strong uptick of pernix prescriptions direct our prescription fulfillment program ppd is gaining increased traction as more patients and providers utilize this program with prescriptions for treximet and silenor increasing by more than  compared to the third quarter of  the continued rapid growth of ppd during the fourth quarter contributed to improving prescription trends across our portfolio and we expect this trend to continue in  as evidence of this as i mentioned earlier ppd as a percentage of our total prescription has reached  for treximet in recent weeks this compares to the  that we reported in the third quarter weve also begun working on a pilot of ppd for zohydro er with beadtek the early results of this pilot have been positive we are currently working on a larger scale national rollout finally as we discussed on our last call to enhance our sales efforts weve wrapped our marketing program to support our three key brands we continue to meaningfully invest in speaker programs during the fourth quarter and started  off strong as well in addition we significantly ramp up our targeted directtopatient efforts and have recently launched our nonpersonal sampling program for treximet to ensure that those healthcare professionals that no longer receive business from our sales representative can still pain starter samples so they can provide to their patients when they are prescribing treximet so we are very pleased with the progress our commercial team has made in  and look forward to continuing the positive momentum throughout  ill now turn the call over to our president and cfo graham miao for a review of the financials graham graham miao thank you george good afternoon everyone as reported in earnings press release this afternoon we are pleased with the progress that pernix team has continued to achieve in execution our turnaround of strategy our vision is to grow our current brands pursue other growth opportunities and maximize longterm stakeholder value in addition as john said we have taken actions to cure our nasdaq listing deficiencies have now regained compliance now let me discuss our overall financial results for the fourth quarter of  the sales performance of our core brands and operating results and i will then review our full year  results and address our balance sheet and liquidity in more detail as a reminder in reviewing sales ill discuss gross to net and important measure of net sales performance in a pharmaceutical business for the sake of clarification if i mention a gross to net of  that means we realized net sales of  for every dollar of gross sales after discounts rebate and returns importantly as a result of the gsk arbitration award and settlement when discussing our operating results ill be using nongaap measures including adjusted net revenues as stated in our press release we made certain accruals in our fourth quarter  financial statements to reflect the impact of the gsk arbitration award the gsk arbitration award also affected several line items on our income statement including cogs and ga expense and interest expense these accruals relate to sales of treximet that occurred in  and  therefore we believe nongaap measure more accurately reflect in the line business performance we use adjusted net revenues to reflect the reclassification of certain gross to net adjustments in our  gaap net revenues to  and  specifically gaap net revenues for the three months and the year ended december   were negatively impacted by  million of disputed treximet rebate claim these claims were recorded in  for sales that occurred in  and  specifically  million and  million for  and  respectively during the fourth quarter of  adjusted net revenues for the company were  million an increase of  from  million in the third quarter of  an increase of  from  million yearoveryear in the fourth quarter of  the sequential increase in adjusted net revenues was driven by several factors including favorable gross to net for our generic portfolio stronger demand for our three core brands and a wholesaler inventory restocking partially offset by a lower gross demand the yearoveryear increase during the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to favorable gross to net for our generic portfolio increased volume for our three core brands partially offset by a decrease in net price now lets look at specifics for each major product for treximet adjusted net revenues were stable during the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  and a fourth quarter of  full year  gross to net for treximet on an adjusted basis were  for silenor fourth quarter  net sales were down slightly as compared to the third quarter of  and the fourth quarter  full year  gross to net for silenor were  for zohydro er net sales increased sequentially by  million or  during the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  yearoveryear zohydro net sales was stable while total prescription volume grew  yearoveryear net sales growth was negatively impacted by wholesaler inventory changes full year  gross to net for zohydro er were  gross margin for the company on an adjusted basis in fourth quarter of  was  up from  in the third quarter of  due primarily to an increase in sales and up from  in fourth quarter a year ago primarily due to product mix sga expense adjusted for legal fees relates with gsk arbitration remained flat at  million this quarter the same as in the prior year period rd expense for fourth quarter of  was a  million compared to  million in the prior year period the decrease was related to lower spend for treximet and silenor fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda was  million an increase of  from  million in the third quarter and a  from  million in the prior year period let me now briefly review our full year  operating results full year  adjusted net revenues were  million as compared to full year  adjusted net revenues of  million a decrease of  this decrease was primarily driven by a  million decrease in adjusted net treximet sales  million decrease in other product revenues and  million decrease in silenor net sales partially offset by  million increase in zohydro net sales full year  adjusted net revenues for treximet were  million as compared to  million in  a decrease of  the decrease was driven primarily by changes in wholesaler inventory as well as a decrease in prescription volume partially offset by favorable net pricing full year  sales of silenor were  million as compared to  million for  a decrease of  the change in silenor in net revenues was driven by changes in wholesaler inventory and a reduction in net price offset by a  increase in prescription volume full year  sales of zohydro er were  million as compared to  million for  an increase of  including a  increase in prescription volume as a reminder pernix acquired zohydro er in april  with the first sale of the product in may  on a comparable over eight months basis zohydro er net revenues increased by  adjusted gross margin for full year  increased to  from  in  adjusted sga expenses excluding the impact of the gsk arbitration award was  million for the full year  as compared to  million in  the increase was driven by legal expenses and was partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses rd expense for the full year  was  million as compared to  million in  this decrease was due primarily to lower spend for treximet and zohydro full year  adjusted ebitda was  million as compared to  million in  now let me turn to our financial condition as john stated we are working to improve our financial flexibility and strengthened our balance sheet as of december   the company had a total liquidity of approximately  million in  to strengthen our balance sheet we raised the capital under our controlled equity program for net proceeds of  million our settlement with gsk which allows us to pay the award over three years with only  million due in  will have a significant positive impact on our liquidity in a near term total principal amount of debt outstanding at december   was approximately  million and net debt was  million the total principal amount of debt consisted of approximately  million of  senior secured notes  million of  convertible notes and  million under our revolving credit facility on february   we made a semiannual principal and interest payment of approximately  million on our  senior secured notes per the terms of the indenture as discussed earlier we continue to analyze various alternatives in order to proactively address our liquidity and capital structure in a constructive manner including strategic and refinancing alternatives asset sales and mergers and acquisitions ill now turn the call back to john sedor john john sedor thank you graham to summarize the changes weve implemented over the last eight months in sales and marketing execution and improvement in our cost structure continue to have a positive impact on our adjusted net revenues and adjusted ebitda we remained focused on continuing to improve our commercial execution and drive growth of our key brand in addition we continue to pursue opportunities to improve our operating cash flow and address our balance sheet we are committed to creating longterm stakeholder value and look forward to a successful  with that ill turn the call over to the operator to open the line for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well go first to patrick dolezal at lifesci capital patrick dolezal hi just one quick question here i was just wondering if you guys may be able to talk a little bit about some of the broader implications of the ppd program george jones yes this is george jones ill be glad to address that question the ppd in todays pharmaceutical market getting branded medication has been become even more challenging for prescribers our ppd program makes it easier for them to access  ensure access of the branded product at the pharmacy as well as alleviates a lot of the burden that the office has to may have to undertake to get a branded product so that has allowed our target prescriptions to more freely prescribe treximet and silenor and enhance their prescribing overall and grew their prescribing overall operator and gentlemen it appears that we have no further questions at this time ill turn the program back over to you for any additional or concluding remarks john sedor thank you lori i think again i just want to commit to our stakeholders that we are focused on driving this company forward and look forward to talking to you at the end of next quarter thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen once again that does conclude todays program and again id like to thank everyone for joining us today copyright policy all
