report adin briefhis finalist year  his finalist project studying how organisms can regenerate parts of themselves what led to the project as a little kid george yancopoulos was fascinated by such

that it had science in the name he says he wanted to become a scientist his finalist year  his finalist project studying how organisms can regenerate parts of themselves what led to the project as a little kid george yancopoulos was fascinated by such questions as how lizards can regrow their tails and how the body works a new york city native whose parents had immigrated from greece the whole reason i went to the bronx high school of science is that it had science in the name he says he wanted to become a scientist he got a good start on that endeavor with his westinghouse project which occupied much of his high school career he studied a singlecelled organism called blepharisma which generally eats bacteria from decomposing vegetation parts of this organism function as a rudimentary digestive system for instance little external hairlike structures called cilia sweep bacteria into a cavity which functions as a mouth blepharisma can regenerate its digestive parts if theyre destroyed and yancopoulos would tinker with the organism to study exactly how it was managing to accomplish this the project fascinated him—which was a good thing given his schedule because he lived in a different borough queens a twohour commute from the bronx he had to leave his house at  am in order to start experiments around  the experiments would run while he was in class and hed check them after school before heading home it made for some long days but the lack of sleep paid off he entered his project in the  westinghouse science talent search and was named a finalist the effect on his career yancopouloss experience cemented his desire to become a scientist but his father—who had immigrated to the us where he worked as a furrier a life insurance salesman and finally a financial planner to support his family—said he hadnt sacrificed just for george to become an underpaid academic researcher he thought he should become a practicing doctor there was however one scientist he told george that it would be all right to emulate p roy vagelos who was at the time a rising star at the pharmaceutical giant merck and later became its ceo vagelos just happened to be a doctor and he just happened to be greek yancopoulos earned an md and phd at columbia university in biochemistry and molecular biophysics finishing in  he then accepted a junior faculty position studying the immune system shortly thereafter he won an eightyear grant worth well over  million in todays money from the lucille p markey charitable trust a foundation that specialized in promoting young biomedical researchers it was a great start for an academic career he marched back to his father triumphantly his father pointed out that although he might have lots of money for lab equipment his own salary was still about  surely if his work was important to people he could earn more than that right around this time yancopoulos got a phone call from leonard schleifer who was recruiting talent for a new biotechnology company this startup would try to figure out ways to regrow nerve cells to potentially treat nervous system disorders such as alzheimers or parkinsons diseases yancopoulos was intrigued with his fathers voice ringing in his ears and aware of the financial rewards that getting in on the ground floor of a company could bring he decided to join the company which became known as regeneron what hes doing now two decades later yancopoulos is now the chief scientific officer at regeneron headquartered in westchester county ny over the years he’s helped direct the company’s research into a variety of areas beyond the original nervous system scope from eye diseases to cancer their first drug arcalyst was approved earlier this year by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of an incredibly rare inflammatory condition—it affects about one in one million—known as the cryopyrinassociated periodic syndromes it is also currently being tested as a treatment for gout yancopoulos oversees regenerons labs which in addition to drugs have developed what he calls the most valuable mouse ever made bred to have immune systems that respond just like a humans would these little critters can quickly show how the human body will react to different compounds one aspect of yancopouloss life came full circle when a few years into regenerons existence the companys small staff of scientists realized that curing diseases might be slightly more difficult than simply regenerating cells they decided that they needed to hire some veteran pharmaceutical leadership top on their list vagelos of merck who to their great surprise agreed to take the chairman job yancopoulos and vagelos have now been working together for  years george yancopoulos is one of the most accomplished biomedical scientists i know vagelos says not only did he lay the groundwork for regenerons first commercial product he has dedicated his career to improving human health through scientific discovery and he will surely continue to succeed in this endeavor hes not the only person who is impressed with yancopouloss discoveries—the latter was elected to the national academy of sciences in  one of the top honors a us scientist can earn in recent years yancopoulos has helped build a program at westchesters yorktown high school that gives students the opportunity to do the kind of research that he undertook for the westinghouse competition many years ago and hes also realized that his father was right research can be worth a lot more than  according to regenerons  securities and exchange commission filings yancopoulos earned  million in salary and bonus that year and held  regeneron shares worth about  million rights  permissions advertisement  report adabout
