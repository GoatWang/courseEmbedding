  putnam high income securities fund  robert p laukat noaction letter dated march   home  previous page securities exchange act of   rule ai and a putnam high income securities fund  robert p laukat march   george b raine esquire ropes  gray one international place boston ma  re putnam high income securities fund file no  shareholder proposal of robert p laukat dear mr raine in a letter dated january   you notified the staff of the securities and exchange commission that the putnam high income securities fund the fund proposes to omit from its proxy materials for its  annual meeting the supporting statement supporting statement to a shareholder proposal the proposal submitted by mr robert p laukat the proponent the proposal provides resolve that the shareholders of the putnam high income bond fund assembled in annual meeting in person and by proxy hereby request the board of directors to take the necessary action to provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors which means each shareholder shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of shares he or she owns multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and he or she may cast all of such votes for a single candidate or any two or more candidates as he or she may see fit you request our assurances that we would not recommend enforcement action if the fund omits the supporting statement in reliance on rules ai and al under the securities exchange act of  the  act omission of the supporting statement based on rules ai and a you assert that because various portions of the supporting statement are false or misleading the fund may omit them pursuant to rule ai this rule allows a company to exclude a proposal that violates any of the commissions proxy rules including rule a under the  act which prohibits materially false and misleading statements in proxy soliciting materials you argue that the supporting statement contains material inaccuracies and omissions and is otherwise vague indefinite andor incomprehensible particularly in paragraphs two through five we cannot assure you that we would not recommend enforcement action if the fund excludes the supporting statement in reliance upon rule ai we do not believe that any statement in the supporting statement rises to the level of materially misleading and many are simply statements of the proponents opinion the fund will have an opportunity to include in its proxy statement arguments reflecting its own point of view on the proposal see rule am staff legal bulletin b companies should address in their statements of opposition objections to opinions or factual assertions that may be disputed or countered even though not materially false or misleading therefore we are unable to concur with your view that the fund may omit the supporting statement under rule ai omission of part of the supporting statement based on rule al you assert that the fund may omit paragraph six because that paragraph contains the proponents address and phone number pursuant to rule al this rule allows a company to omit a proponents name and address so long as the company includes a statement that it will provide the information to shareholders promptly upon receiving an oral or written request there appears to be some basis for your view that you may omit the proponents name address and telephone number from the supporting statement in reliance on rule al this position assumes that the fund will include in its proxy materials a statement that the name and address will be furnished by the fund to any person promptly upon request see strategic global income fund inc pub avail march   accordingly the staff would not recommend enforcement action against the fund if it omits the sixth paragraph of the supporting statement in reliance upon rule al  provided that it provides the proponents name and address including his telephone number to shareholders who request it  attached is a description of the informal procedures the division follows in responding to shareholder proposals if you have any questions or comments regarding this matter please contact the undersigned at   sincerely linda b stirling senior counsel cc robert p laukat endnotes  we also received and considered the proponents letters of january   and january    the putnam high income securities fund was formerly known as the putnam high income bond fund  we note that you do not argue that paragraph one specifically contains false or misleading information rather your arguments pertain to paragraphs two through five
