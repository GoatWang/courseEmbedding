frequently asked questions  faqs frequently asked questions  faqsq what about insurancea general liability insurance is something that most golf courses already have and golfboarding should be added to your policy the golfboard should be treated very similar to golf carts by most insurance providers solboards inc has already secured a m general liability policy from hartford and a m excess liability policy from aig we have developed a detailed safety training video which all new riders watch prior to operating a golfboard after viewing the safety video new users are also required to sign a liability release acknowledging that they understand the operation and safety principlesq why should i replace my carts with a fleet of golfboards if so much of our membership is oldera golfboards are a supplement to your golf carts and will provide your club with an opportunity to bring in new membership and give you a competitive advantage over neighboring facilities the golfboard is nothing like a traditional skateboard or snowboard it is easy and intuitive to operate and a lot more stable than first time riders might expect we have seen older players who have no riding experience try the golfboard and end up riding comfortably after just a few minutes of practice golfboards also take up less space in between use charge faster and greatly reduce the maintenance costs compared to regular golf cartsq wont golfboards tear up the grassa not at all golfboards use the same turf tires found on standard golf course maintenance equipment the combined weight of the rider and golfboard is approximately  pounds less than that of a golf cart greatly reducing soil compaction and turf stress our boards use a proprietary  wheeldrive system allowing power to be distributed to all  wheels equally reducing turf wear the board’s smooth acceleration ensures a fluid increase in speed that won’t cause turfdamaging burnoutsq what if a golfer has never ridden a skatesnowsurfboard before will they be able to use the golfboarda absolutely the beauty of the golfboard is that it was designed to be a high performance machine that is easy enough for anyone to use once riders position themselves on the board they use the barmounted thumb throttle to control the acceleration and braking and by simply leaning side to side they control the turning of the golfboard the golfboard controls feature a lowhigh speed switch allowing beginner riders to practice and increase their confidence riding while in the low speed mode traveling at a maximum of  mph the stability barbag holder provides an added point of control that provides confidence and security to even the most inexperienced ridersq what type of terrainsurfaces can these boards handle a one of the great things about the golfboard is that is was designed to handle every type of terrain and surface you can throw under it from steep grassy slopes and paved trails to soft turf terrain and loose gravel not only will these boards handle these terrains but their large turf tires will keep all of them in beautiful conditionq how are the boards powered and chargeda the boards are powered by a compact  volt lithium battery pack built into the base of the board the lithium batteries used in golfboards are lighter more powerful and last much longer than lead acid batteries and require zero maintenance charging the boards takes approximately  hours allowing the boards to spend more time out on the course the cost for a full recharge is around   the batteries can be cycled fully drained and charged  times giving the battery packs a life of approximately  rounds of golfq what are the financing and leasing options for golfboardsa we want to give all courses big and small alike a chance to carry our
