firstinclass innovative therapies that have the potential to redefine treatment outcomes for patients with a variety of cancers about cancer treatment resistance despite the availability of drugs that improve survival in patients with cancer treatment failure attributed to resistance continues to be a major problem in medical oncology across multiple tumor types the majority of patients with cancer are likely to face treatment resistance at some point cancer cells may be intrinsically resistant to treatment primary resistance or they may acquire mechanisms that allow survival acquired resistance initial treatment may result in residual disease that gives rise to treatmentresistant tumors and eventually contributes to disease relapse oncogenex addressing an unsolved problem in medical oncology given the widespread problem of treatment resistance in oncology new strategies are needed to overcome resistance with the goal of providing longterm remissions oncogenex has focused its efforts on meeting the challenge of cancer treatment resistance through the development of novel therapeutics that target important mechanisms of treatment resistance in cancer with the potential to redefine treatment outcomes for patients with a variety of cancers a number of biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to treatment resistance our lead investigational compounds are designed to address two such targets clusterin and hsp custirsen is an experimental drug designed to block the production of clusterin a cytoprotective protein which is upregulated in tumor cells in response to treatment interventions such as chemotherapy hormone ablation and radiation therapy and has been found to be overexpressed in a number of cancers including prostate lung breast and bladder  increased clusterin production has been linked to faster rates of cancer progression treatment resistance and shorter survival duration learn more about custirsen apatorsen ogx is an experimental drug designed to inhibit the production of hsp a protein that is elevated in many cancers and that has been shown to promote cancer cell growth and tumor metastasis hsp protects cancer cells by helping them survive leading to treatment resistance and more aggressive cancer phenotypes overexpression of hsp has been observed in many types of cancers including bladder lung pancreatic and prostate learn more about apatorsen our historyoncogenex was established in may  as a spin out from the prostate centre at vancouver general hospital and the university of british columbia it was cofounded by dr martin gleave the company’s scientific founder and chief scientific advisor and scott cormack oncogenex’ president and ceo initially to develop and commercialize custirsen ogx which was discovered at the prostate centre by dr gleave and his colleaguesoncogenex’ headquarters and clinical and regulatory teams are located in bothell washington the office of the ceo and other critical business functions remain in vancouver ensuring oncogenex’ continued partnership with the university of british columbia and leading cancer researchers this also allows us to forgo the need to establish a preclinical
