reinventing itselffeb  about neonode inc neon dutch trader deep value special situations contrarian long onlysummaryneonode deserves a second lookairbar could become a game changer and help millions of pc usersprofitability right around the corner i have been following neonode nasdaqneon for some years now and i just recently pulled the trigger to buy some shares in this tiny company with a market capitalization of approximately  million neonode is a swedish company with its headquarters in stockholm sweden it was established in  by magnus goertz and thomas eriksson eriksson currently is the ceo the company had a creative history with the development of the worlds first fingerbased mobile touch phone the neonode n phone the followup neonode n phone was released in   the year neonode listed on the nasdaq at the end of  the company failed to survive and declared bankruptcy thomas eriksson kept his faith and established neonode once again the company is focused exclusively on the development licensing and selling of its proprietary zforce technology which is trademarked as the neonode multisensing technologies multisensing is an optical touch technology that uses a web of light beams the significant advantages compared to capacitive touch solutions is the fact that it offers lower power consumption improved speed accuracy and clearer view the technology is used by many different consumers and industrial electronic products such as printers mobile phones ereaders home appliances and also in car infotainment systems what made me bullish despite the fact that neonode has been despised by several contributors in the past i think the current stock price gives speculative investors an appealing entry point to buy shares in a company that is reinventing itself in december  neonode introduced an ingenious product that could give a boost to the companys revenues its called airbar this brings the touch screen to millions of pc and laptop users who currently dont have this feature according to the company airbar is a slim module that is magnetically attached at the bottom of a pcs display when attached and plugged into the usb port the sensor is activated and starts to emit invisible light to detect the users touch and gestures pc users can then interact with their devices using familiar touch actions like swiping pinching zooming and scrolling airbar is a portable solution to be used at home in the office at school or when traveling and can be used with fingers gloves long fingernails and even paintbrushes i think this is a great start to show investors that it can capture certain markets with affordable and attractive consumer products with the airbar the company shows that it can invent affordable and attractive consumer products using its zforce technology personally i think this could be a great success story going forward financials looking at the financials doesnt give you a comfortable feeling because the company never made a profit revenues are increasing so you could see that its technology is in demand reading through the conference call transcript the cfo mentions that the companys internal target is to be profitable this year and cash flow breakeven in the first quarter of this year so this gives the impression that the company seems to be on the right track takeaway the only way to operate a rising number of devices from home appliances smartphones to automotive screens is the use of a finger on a touchscreen neonode is a company at the forefront to capture market share in this space the company just reinvented itself by introducing the airbar disclosure i amwe are long neon i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking

nancreate a network that meets all your computing needsif you own a small to mediumsized business or need to operate an office out of your home you may need to set up a network even if you don t use them for business maybe you have a large family you may have several computers that need internet access at the same time to do this you can incorporate several devices that make computing in your home or business much easier faster and more efficient we have low prices every day on everything so you can build the ideal network for your needs and save some money at the same time check out some of the essential components thatll keep your network running smoothlyroutersrouters allow several different computers to connect to an existing network although some routers still exist that require you to physically attach your computers to them many of the updated models available today can connect to your computer wirelessly this allows other devices such as smartphones tablets and smart tvs to also connect to the router via wifi note that for the modem to let you access the internet you need to establish an outside connection to an internet provider and then connected it to the modem which you then connect to the router to create an internet protocol address otherwise the network only connects to the other devices that you connect to it to enable file sharing there are certain key factors to know when selecting what router to purchaseradio bandwidth although some routers feature a single bandwidth most are dualband routers that let you connect to the internet via one of two radio frequencies ghz and ghz this allows your router users to be on different bands in the same home or business it also facilitates faster speeds for whatever youre doing on the web such as downloading files or watching videoscoverage this determines how strong the signal that the router puts out is and it can mean that users on the outer edge of the coverage area may experience drops or lag in what theyre doingports the types of ports available such as ethernet ports determine what you can connect to the router routers with ethernet ports allow faster filetransfer rates those with usb ports let you connect other devices to the router such as a scanner or printermodemsmodems let routers or computers connect directly to the internet via an outside source such as a digital subscriber line dsl internet service or cable internet service cable connections occur with a coaxial cable connection theyre similar to whats used when connecting a television to a cable service box dsl connections are made using a telephone connection which is sometimes referred to as an rj connection that runs to a telephone socket on a wall although very rare dialup modems are also still in production and use ordinary phone lines to connect to an internet service provider isp when choosing a modem the key factors you want to look for include compatibility with your computers or other devices operating system such as windows or ios the upload and download speeds it provides security protection such as wep encryption and wpawpa security protocol size of the modem and the cost of the modemsignal boosters and devicesfor those who have older technology in their modems or routers there are options to ensure better wifi reception in your home or place of business you could move the router to a more central location but that might not be feasible a signal booster also known as a wifi repeater makes it possible to amplify the signal your router produces for example if the modem you use to connect your network to your isp is in your garage or in an outlying office in your business you can place a signal booster in the center of your location which will repeat the same level of signal it receives to the other areas of your location this can as much as double your routers coverage areaif the router youre using is current and in the best spot to receive its signal but your coverage is still weak then a wifi extender can solve your issues wifi extenders allow you to send the routers signal through the electrical circuitry in your business or home you then connect an adapter to an electrical outlet near where your router is and add a second adapter to an electrical outlet where you need the signal to improve you can also do this with an ethernet cable when connecting to an ethernet device such as a video game console or smart tv you can even create a secondary wifi network in this manner look for wifi repeaters or extenders based on the coverage area in square feet to determine which one is right for your needsother networking itemsthere are other devices you can use when setting up your own networkusb wireless network adapters these small devices plug into your desktop or laptop computer and let you connect to a network wirelesslynetworkattached storage if you have limited storage space on your computer and dont want to store your documents

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
