to section b  of the securities exchange act of  the “act”  and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on february   nyse arca inc the “exchange” or “nyse arca” filed with the securities and exchange commission the “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the selfregulatory organization the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange proposes to modify the arca options deep market data product the proposed rule change is available on the exchanges web site at wwwnysecom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the selfregulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and the statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to modify the arca options deep market data product the exchange currently offers the following realtime options market data feeds “arca options top” “arca options deep” and “arca options complex” the “arca options products” “arca options top” is a single market data product that combines last sale data best bids and offers “bbo” order imbalance information and series status and underlying status messages collectively called security status messages “arca options deep” is also a single market data product that provides subscribers nyse arca options quotes and orders at the first three price levels in each series on a realtime basis “arca options complex” also a single market data product provides subscribers nyse arca options quote and trade information including ordersquotes requests for responses and trades for the complex order book on a realtime basis the exchange charges a single fee for arca options top and subscribers of arca options top receive all three data feeds described above the exchange charges a separate fee for arca options complex for subscribers that seek to obtain this data feed on a standalone basis start printed page  the exchange proposes to modify the arca options deep data feed as proposed arca options deep will also include security status messages the same data that is currently provided as part of arca options top the proposed modification to the arca options deep data feed will allow subscribers who currently obtain depth of market data to also receive security status messages in a single data feed currently these subscribers are required to process two data feeds to get the depth of market data and security status information offering a data product that combines in one market data product depth of market data and security status messages would provide greater efficiencies and better sequencing for vendors and subscribers that currently choose to integrate the data after receiving it from the exchange as with arca options top arca options deep would provide depth of market and series status information on a realtime basis as reported to the options price reporting authority “opra” and disseminated on a consolidated basis under the opra plan the arca options products would continue to be distributed in their current format to maintain the format of the arca options products with that of other market data products offered by the exchange the exchange does not propose to make any changes to the fees the single fee charged for the arca options product that comprise sic the arca options top arca options deep and arca options complex would continue to apply the separate fee that now applies to arca options complex would likewise continue to apply to the arca options complex market data product each of the arca options products would continue to be offered through the exchanges liquidity center network “lcn” a local area network in the exchanges mahwah new jersey data center that is available to users of the exchanges colocation services the exchange would also continue to offer the products through the exchanges secure financial transaction infrastructure “sfti” network through which all other users and member organizations access the exchanges trading and execution systems and other proprietary market data products the exchange will announce the date that the arca options deep market data product will begin to include security status messages through a nyse market data notice the proposed change is not intended to address any issues other than those described herein and the exchange is not aware of any problems that vendors or subscribers would have in complying with the proposed change  statutory basis the proposed rule change is consistent with section b  of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b  of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section b of the act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with improved options for receiving market data the proposed rule changes would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to the additional realtime information contained in a modified arca options deep market data product in particular the exchange believes that combining depth of market data with security status messages in the arca options deep product is reasonable because it would provide greater efficiencies for vendors and subscribers that currently choose to integrate the data after receiving it from the exchange in addition the change to the arca options deep product reflects the interests and needs of subscribers and vendors who will no longer have to subscribe to multiple data feeds to obtain the information they want the exchange believes the proposed changes are reasonable because they would provide vendors and subscribers with higher quality market data products in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the exchange believes that the options data product changes proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data product evolutions that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms the commission concluded that regulation nms—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the acts goals of facilitating efficiency and competition efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data the commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history the exchange further notes that the existence of alternatives to the exchanges products including realstart printed page time consolidated data free delayed consolidated data and proprietary data from other sources ensures that the exchange is not unreasonably discriminatory because vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives the proposed options data products will help to protect a free and open market by providing additional data to the marketplace and give investors greater choices in addition the proposal would not permit unfair discrimination because the products will be available to all of the exchanges customers and brokerdealers through both the lcn and sfti b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition in accordance with section b of the act the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the market for proprietary data products is currently competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings trades and market data itself providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to produce and distribute their own market data this proprietary data is produced by each individual exchange as well as other entities such as internalizing brokerdealers and various forms of alternative trading systems including dark pools and electronic communication networks in a vigorously competitive market it is common for market participants to further and exploit this competition by sending their order flow and transaction reports to multiple markets rather than providing them all to a single market c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others no written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action the exchange has filed the proposed rule change pursuant to section baiii of the act  and rule bf thereunder because the proposed rule change does not i significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest ii impose any significant burden on competition and iii become operative prior to  days from the date on which it was filed or such shorter time as the commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest the proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to section ba of the act and rule bfiii thereunder a proposed rule change filed under rule bf  normally does not become operative prior to  days after the date of the filing however pursuant to rule bfiii the commission may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest the exchange has asked the commission to waive the day operative delay so that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing the commission believes that waiver of the operative delay is consistent with investor protection and the public interest because the proposal would allow the exchange to offer currently available market data in a streamlined format that would enhance the quality of market data available to investors and would enable investors to better monitor trading activity on the exchange accordingly the commission hereby waives the day operative delay and designates the proposal operative upon filing at any time within  days of the filing of such proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act if the commission takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings under section bb  of the act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved iv
