unfavorable market conditions   stock selection the fund generally buys stocks with exceptional appreciation potential due to the stocks price being significantly below the intrinsic value of the company – forester capital’s estimate of the amount a buyer would pay to own the entire company forester capital performs its own fundamental analysis of the company forester capital believes that if it buys more earnings assets and dividends with each investment dollar than its benchmark it should perform well thus the fund places special focus on companies whose current market prices are low in

result of overreaction by investors to unfavorable news about a company industry or the stock markets in general or as a result of a market decline poor economic conditions or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company this undervaluation may lead to great appreciation potential for the security the fund may sell a stock when forester capital thinks the stock is too expensive compared to forester capital’s estimate of the company’s intrinsic value changing circumstances affect the original reasons for a company’s purchase a company exhibits deteriorating fundamentals or more attractive alternatives exist under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets at market value at the time of purchase in the common stocks of large companies that have market capitalizations greater than  billion the fund may also invest in preferred stocks convertible securities warrants and foreign securities the fund may also invest in stock and stock index futures options to buy and sell such futures mutual funds and exchange traded funds   capital protection we use risk control to preserve capital and enhance returns by avoiding overvalued markets this can be done by buying options futures or other instruments or going to cash to adjust market exposure the fund avoided the down equity market by taking a defensive position

an investment portfolio through the turbulent s he started his career as a money manager in  assisting in the management of a us million fund for sir john templeton he later worked for wells fargo  co in minneapolis minnesota and scudder investments in new york city in  he experienced a losing investment in subprime lenders forester moved to libertyville illinois a northern suburb of chicago in  when he purchased a home in the town in  he started his own large cap value fund with  of his own money although he was in cash during the dotcom bubble which proved to be profitable for a while he trailed the sp  by  in  he also trailed the market from – his wife kaye with whom he is raising two children had been encouraging him to close his business prior to  in october  they agreed that he would close the business if he was not beating the sp  by  by march although he only led the market by  his wife agreed to allow him to keep the business going after his fund took first place for yeartodate returns in the summer he put  in cash although he is not repeating his success in  his fund is receiving large cash contributions forester has been involved in civic duties in libertyville and national political efforts as of  he was a trustee of the cook memorial library district in  he attempted to run on a republican slate of delegates for united states president george w bush however due to an insufficient number of signatures on the slates petition they were removed from the ballot he was unsuccessful in his election to the cook memorial library district board in during the  municipal elections forester value fundedit in  the fund was subject of controversy when morningstar attempted to reclassify it into the conservativeallocation fund category mutual fund managers including forester believed that the fund belonged in another classification such as a largecap value fund which is how lipper had it classified value line inc classified it as an income fund at the time the move bumped alpha hedged strategies fund out of first place for its classification year to date as of november   the controversy not only led to complaints directly to morningstar but also to the securities exchange commission in  there were  diversified united states stock mutual funds and they averaged a negative  rate of return  of these funds have been in existence for over three years and have assets of at least  million foresters forester value fund fvalx which is morningstar fivestarrated gained  in  although one year it lagged the standard  poors  sp  by  the fund which had been up  through june  by avoiding the housing crisis and the credit crisis was down  on the year through december  and  on the year entering the last day of trading in  the second best of the  funds was mario gabellis gabelli abc fund which lost only  morningstar tracks a total of  mutual funds that averaged a  loss in  much of foresters success was attributable to large cash positions however he also benefited from several timely trades in the banking sector health care his fund held positions in countercyclical stocks that perform well in recessions he had also held large cash positions during the dotcom bubble in the third quarter of  his fund was one of two out of  that turned a profit one of the most important financial ratios for forest was the ratio of home prices to incomes which helped him foresee trouble in the housing market he has had very inconsistent returns managing his fund during the last seven years his fund has been in the top  of its peer group three times

forester who runs his fund from libertyville became a celebrity he made his first television appearance in december and newspapers from as far away as chiles el mercurio have requested interviews with him in an interview with the wall street journal forester conceded that because his fund is smaller than many of his peers he is able to get in and out of portfolio positions faster than others and that his returns would have been much lower if he had been managing a larger portfolio however he said his success at beating the market was more attributable to his financial market assessments than his funds size because of the publicity his fund has been receiving in the down market its assets under management grew fivefold during  due to foresters investing style of buying low pe stocks with good earnings prospects he is compared to warren buffett forester loosely quotes buffett at times such as in barrons magazine when he said its when the tide goes out that you find out whos swimming
