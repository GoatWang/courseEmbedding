as you would expect at facebook there is a strong focus on it it could be argued that cio tim campos embodies the new approach to ciolevel management having moved from techie through an mba degree to drive it innovation in one of the worlds hottest it businesses the role of it and how you do your job is usually operational and about efficiency and cost saving facebook is quite frugal but there is so much more emphasis on innovation it is not just about the squeeze says campos in an interview with computer weekly the company became an enterprise in the cloud computing age so the architecture is different from a traditional it department the difference according to campos is that there is a greater emphasis on the application of technology rather than the setup the economics of cloud computing are everpresent at facebook we are a saas softwareasaservice environment with not much onpremise the scaling is easier so i do not worry about having to double up he says we have social media embedded into the information system everything is integrated on facebook we even have a recruiting system based on profiles with integrated resumes we also use facebook groups and tools built on facebook to help the team collaborate he adds campos looks after the social networking sites internal it systems for over  employees he manages a strong it team which represents just  of the total workforce he has worked for the social network since august  and says managing facebooks it department is not without its challenges around  of facebooks it environment is apple macintoshbased from an it perspective that is more of a challenge because it is a hybrid environment he says microsoft exchange does not work very well with the mac but users love the mac career progression campos started his career in engineering and initially resisted accepting a cio role he did an electrical engineering and computer science degree course at the university of california in berkeley and started his career at sybase as an intern while still studying the internship was fairly mundane but paid three times more than my friends jobs working in bars i was able to make my mark the job was auditing and writing bug fixes i automated it and took it from a days work down to two hours it gave me some time to have fun but when my boss figured out what i had done he gave me more to do until i was doing the work of a fulltime engineer campos moved to an engineering role at silicon graphics before joining internet startup portera systems at the age of  he became the youngest cio of a fortune  company at klatencor he believes his technical experience in engineering as well as general management have made him successful in his ability to make a business tie the line between engineering and technology is blurry when the cio asked me to help out with problems i initially resisted but he gave me an offer i could not refuse so i said i would help until the end of the summer i fell in love with it and the type of problems it involved he says i learned that it is more businessfocused than engineering it is not just how to make technology work but how to do it to produce a business result and how to translate business into technical strategy after studying for a mba campos looked to startups to continue his career but when facebook came up he saw it as a onceinalifetime opportunity future of the cio role for campos it is evolving into a chief operating officer role the new type of leader must be more businessfocused the cio is becoming like the coo the cio is becoming irrelevant in some organisations and more businessfocused facebook needs to evolve as the internet continues to grow the technology used for the internet is only starting we are on the social wave which is giving meaning to all the internet connections we have several waves of innovation to come cloud computing is one of them the company is beginning to move to greater openness this goes even as far as an openplan office the facebook office culture is also in keeping with the openness of its infrastructure noone has an office  and i mean noone mark zuckerberg just has a desk it is very open and very conducive for collaboration given its global reach and the homage hollywood has paid to facebook in the film the social network it has never been so glamorous      facebook launches project to open source its datacentre   in the spirit of open source software facebook says it wants to share the innovations in one of its datacentres with the rest of the industry in its open compute project the

of cios discussing the future of business and it search form search  takeaways for cios from facebook cio tim campos  takeaways for cios from facebook cio tim campos up readers like this by ginny hamilton on august   one of the initial projects facebook cio tim campos was tasked with when he joined the company was developing an email and knowledge management strategy he felt pretty good about his plan but after presenting it to cofounder and ceo mark zuckerberg and others he quickly realized he was the only one who really liked it “everyone was pretty against my idea except for me” campos told attendees of the cio  conference in colorado springs co on tuesday a couple of days after presenting the idea campos said he received an email from zuckerberg with the subject line “will you resign” campos who had only been at the company for about two months at that point said it took him a couple of hours to work up the courage to open the email when he did he quickly realized it wasn’t addressed to him personally it was an email to the entire company the email came after an employee leaked destructive information campos said in the email zuckerberg asked for whoever leaked the information to please resign campos said saying that facebook would figure out who it was eventually zuckerberg went on to write that the employee obviously didn’t share the same values of openness and transparency because they shared the confidential information in a way they were asked not to do campos used the email as an example to emphasize three takeaways from his time at facebook that he hoped other cios could take back to their organizations the email he said emphasized the power of culture “it serves to reinforce the point we’re not going to solve this problem by locking down all the information we’re not going to solve this problem by instituting a lot of bureaucracy we’re going to solve this problem by embedding it into the culture” the three takeaways campos shared from his time at facebook are  the power of culture “at facebook culture is everything and it’s an incredible timesaver” campos said culture allows facebook to cut through bureaucracy he said among the ways facebook emphasizes its culture is through its now wellknown posters that say things like fail harder move fast and break things and what would you do if you weren’t afraid facebook also reinforces its culture through storytelling like the “will you resign” email example he shared with the audience “it was an incredibly powerful message” campos explained “everybody at the company read this email and had the exact same takeaway and perspective that i did they all thought it was immediately addressed to them and it was striking as a result of that and they never forgot it and we keep talking about it  we talk about how do we handle confidential information in the company the ‘will you resign’ email is quite famous” there are a ton of stories like this that facebook uses to reinforce key culture points that prevent the creation of unnecessary steering committees and advisory boards campos said  the power of innovation campos cited two key ingredients to innovation that he believes leaders can reinforce  the power to fail and whitespace on failure campos said “when failure is not an option you basically encourage the workforce to do the tried and true and the tried and true by definition is not innovative” but when you encourage employees to fail when you tell them that it’s good and that they can learn from it then you create an entirely different environment he said he emphasized that failure is too big if it puts the company at risk with startups being an exception he said the key is to fail quickly and deliberately and experiment in ways that are proportional to what you’re trying to accomplish on whitespace campos used facebook’s famous hackathons as an example employees are basically given three days off to go build what they want with no expectations on output and no required product focus that they must follow “you never know how these things are going to evolve and by giving people the ability to fail and giving them the time to fail then you have created the necessary ingredients for innovation” he said  the power of data “we use data to make decisions on everything if there’s a product modification that we need to make if there’s a product launch that we do you can bet that there is a ton of data behind it that reinforces that this is a good idea” campos said just how powerful can data be campos used an example he thought cios would find particularly relevant sharing a problem his it organization helped solve with a datadriven decision the problem the sales organization was complaining about how long it took to fill out expense reports the finance and it organizations had two competing views on the problem finance thought sales was just complaining it thought it either needed to build a new solution or get sales to use the mobile version of the existing solution who was right neither of them the data told a different story the data found that there was actually a fair amount of mobile adoption of the expense tool the reason why it was taking sales a long time to submit expense reports was because of a policy issue campos said the policy was simply modified “with almost no lines of code we saved every sales person over an hour of time a week and when we announced this at our sales conference at the beginning of the year my organization got a giant standing ovation because of this one little policy change imagine if we hadn’t used data to make this decision” the message on the slide campos showed as he told this story hit the point home “data wins arguments” he emphasized these takeaways because he said over the next  years cios will have a huge opportunity to create economic value on data that their organizations have been sitting on for decades but to do so requires a change in mindset and a change in leadership the power of datadriven business models “data is a powerful model for technology organizations to create economic value” campos said if you get it right data can be a unique source of differentiation because you can’t easily replicate data so what are the ingredients of a successful databased business model campos emphasized sourcing processing capability utility and scarcity in particular he said to look for unique sourcing for your data the opportunities data open up include cost optimization user experience and revenue models the issues cios can expect to run into as they dig into their data are information security privacy expectations and regulation leadership and culture pace of innovation campos emphasized the importance of privacy “there are implicit and explicit privacy expectations that users have and they have to be honored and respected” he left the audience with this question “what are your information assets” related content get value out of the many dimensions of big data use realtime big data processing to unlock the business value  technology predictions for cios tags cultureinnovationbig data comments  as community manager for the

enabled by our company culture and together they shape how we work together the it organization at facebook is focused on having the most productive workforce possible and the foundation for facebook’s continual innovation is our ethic of collaboration that empowers everyone to bring their best ideas to the table to enable our productivity it at facebook provides our people with the best tools available tools that can mean the difference between just having an idea and bringing that idea to life the people who use facebook are distributed around the world and to support them our people are globally distributed as well we facilitate their productivity by letting them choose the device and platform that is most effective for them we collaborate on everything online—no files no fragmented information stores—and we provide our employees with the ability to work anywhere and in any way they want all of this means that our it has to be flexible and available over the web on
