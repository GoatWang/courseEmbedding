performance which does not guarantee future results current performance may differ from figures shown investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares footnotes a statistical measurement of the range of a funds total returns in general a higher standard deviation means greater volatility based on the funds monthly returns over the year period ended as of the date of the calculation a statistical measurement of a funds historical riskadjusted performance it is calculated by taking a funds excess return over that of the threemonth treasury bill divided by its standard deviation higher values generally indicate better historical riskadjusted performance based on the  years ended as of the date of the calculation the annualized percentage difference between a funds actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk as measured by beta based on the year period ended as of the date of the calculation the funds day standardized yield is calculated over a trailing day period using the yield to maturity on bonds andor the dividends accrued on stocks it may not equal the funds actual income distribution rate which reflects the funds past dividends paid to shareholders public offering price — purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day it includes the maximum initial sales charge if any net asset value — the amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day source morningstar® the style box reveals a funds investment style for credit quality of the bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to 7 of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration between 7 to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those at  or greater of the mcbi will be classified as extensive shaded areas show the past  years of quarterly data past performance does not guarantee future results source morningstar® for each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a year history morningstar calculates a morningstar rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure against other funds in the same category this measure takes into account variations in a funds monthly performance and does not take into account the effects of sales charges placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the weights are  year rating for 9 months of total returns  year rating year rating for 9 months of total returns and  year rating year rating year rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rating™ is for the
