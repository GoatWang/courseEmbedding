was contributed capital repayment to related party loan for  and the release of restricted cash provided  limited operating history need for additional capital there is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance we are a development stage corporation and have not generated any revenues from operations to fully implement our business plan we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and competition from larger organizations we will require equity andor debt financing to provide for the capital required to implement our plans we will require additional funds to operate for the next year we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations equity financing as envisioned by our offering will result in additional dilution to existing shareholders liquidity and capital resources from may   inception through january   we have relied on funds loaned to us by kratos healthcare inc kratos a company controlled by an officer and director to fund our initial working capital requirements the current amount due is  in principal and kratos has agreed to loan us additional amounts of up to a total of  inclusive of cash advances to date in the event we are not successful in reaching our initial revenue targets additional funds may be required and we may not be able to proceed with our business plan for the development and marketing of our core services should this occur we would likely seek additional financing to support the continued operation of our business we anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future therefore our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of january   we have no employees other than our chief financial officer who we have verbally agreed to pay for management services our officers and directors are donating their time to the development of our company as of january   an officer who is also a director and a shareholder was owed nil july    nil for management fees and during the six months ended january   received cash payments of nil    for management fees contractual obligations as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations going concern as of january   our company had a net loss of  and has earned no revenues our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending july   the ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon among other things obtaining additional financing to continue operations and development of our business plan in response to these problems management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty table of contents offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from

sale of   shares shares application of net proceeds minimum maximum marketing efforts web site     working capital   total     our business plan allows for the estimated  cost of this registration statement to be paid from cash flow from loans by our officers and directors or from an entity controlled by our officers and not from the company offering we have no formal written agreement regarding these costs with the net proceeds of this offering we intend develop our web site engage services to improve search engine optimization and expand our marketing efforts through professional and social networking we also expect to deploy additional capital by contracting parttime lecturers to present or our icd and management seminars at corporate and professional meetings we believe that such seminars are both a minor profit center as well as an adjunct to our overall marketing efforts in order to achieve maximum leverage from our marketing efforts we will focus on developing and promoting internet web based seminars webinars which in addition to providing the specific information the attendees will be seeking will highlight our multiple training and consulting abilities it is also common in local healthcare settings hospital staff group practices to present a live seminar to a small group of attendees and provide it to a wider audience via a live internet feed we expect to provide these seminars at no cost to the sponsoring entity which will pay the entire cost of providing the venue and internet connectivity initially our officers will conduct the live seminars and will not be compensated the minimum proceeds of this offering  for marketing will allow us to proceed with the lowcost seminarwebinar approach to promoting our services by developing seminar content and integrating it with the website with the maximum proceeds of our offering in addition to the small seminar webinars previously discussed we will seek opportunities to provide full day seminars at professional meetings such as the local or state medical association specialty associations nursing associations and healthcare management associations the additional  available for marketing if the maximum amount of our offering is achieved will be sufficient to develop scripts and audiovisual content for several full day seminars we hope that the success of the small seminarwebinar platform will help us establish the credibility to present at larger venues such associations have stringent criteria for choosing seminar providers and we cannot reliability predict if we will be successful in obtaining such opportunities all of our web development audiovisual materials and printed seminar materials are equally applicable to either the small or large venues so the application of funds available from a successful minimum offering to that of the maximum offering will result in a seamless increase in the velocity with which we achieve our marketing activities the amount allocated to working capital is arbitrary and is budgeted due to the uncertainty of cash flow from our operations if cash flow from operations is sufficient to pay our ongoing expenses we expect to hold these funds in reserve we believe the anticipated minimum proceeds of this offering  together with cash on hand and anticipated cash flow from operating activities will allow us to conduct our operations for at least the next  months if the minimum number of shares is sold and for an indeterminate longer time if the maximum number of shares is sold there are no underwriting commissions involved in this offering our common stock will be sold on our behalf by our officers and directors our officers and directors will not receive any commissions or proceeds from the offering for selling the shares on our behalf the healthcare management business is competitive and among qualified participants has low barriers to entry we compete locally and will eventually compete on a statewide basis with a variety of primarily local companies that offer similar services as ours based on our review of advertisements and internet web sites we believe the majority of these companies are entrenched in the conventional healthcare system and are themselves struggling to adapt to the new requirements of healthcare as defined by the emerging standards of accountable care others appear to be knowledgeable about the icd standards coding and their possible impact on reimbursement rates we hope to form strategic alliances with companies that have demonstrable expertise in specialized areas some of these companies have had many more years of business experience have proprietary processes or have greater financial and personnel resources including marketing and sales organizations and may be able to provide their services at lower rates we do not believe any one company holds a dominant share of the local or statewide market on which we are focused company description panamera healthcare corporation offers management and consulting services to healthcare organizations that are increasingly facing various stresses including financial organizational and information technology challenges the reasons for these stresses are multifactorial and include longstanding trends in healthcare but also include recent challenges brought about by the affordable care act the mandated implementation of icdcmpcs international classification of diseases th edition clinical codificationprocedure coding system icd and economic factors related to varying and uncertain reimbursement rates our initial contracts are with consulting firms that offer services similar to ours but lack expertise in certain areas the market is so vast that at this point in our development we do not consider such collaborations as a threat to our business and we believe that collaboration may result in longterm benefits to us  we were incorporated in the state of nevada on may   our principal executive office
