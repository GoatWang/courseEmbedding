goldsmith who settled in nuremberg in  and in  married his masters daughter the young albrecht was first apprenticed to his father and was then bound for three years to the painter michael wolgemut whose large workshop also produced woodcut bookillustrations for the printer anton koberger durers godfather he traveled for four years from easter  visiting colmar basle and strasbourg and in may  he returned to nuremberg and married in the autumn of  he went to venice during this visit he met giovanni bellini whom he greatly admired and painted several works for the german merchants of venice which shows some knowledge of leonardo on his return he intensified the learned side of his art and personality he studied mathematics geometry latin and humanist literature and sought the company of scholars rather than that of his fellow artistisans this departure in mode of life and thought was directly traceable to the influence of leonardo and mantegna and the example of bellini and though it was common enough in italy it was unprecedented in germany in  he became court painter to the emporer maximillian and in july  he journeyed to the netherlands to obtain from his successor charles v the ratification of his post and pension he saw the coronation of the new emperor at aachen and was confirmed in his office visited antwerp brussels malines cologne middleburg brugues and ghent and was honored and feted all along the route he returned home in july  and despite ill health resulting from fever probably contracted in the swamps of zealand where he had ventured in the hope of seeing a dead whale he worked unremittingly until his deathdurers enormous oeuvre consists of woodcuts and engravings paintings and preparatory and independent drawings and he also wrote treatises on measurement fortification proportion and artistic theory besides his detailed diary of his netherlands journey he was the main channel through which italian renaissance forms and ideas were introduced into the north and he combined these with the individualism general in german art and inherited from the gothic tradition his greatest influence was through his graphic work he is one of the supreme masters of woodcut and copper engravings and these easily transportable models carried his technique subjects designs and style all over europe and even had a considerable influence in italy he extended the range of woodcut and engraving by perfecting the technique of both and raised the standard of graphic art by the training he gave to the workmen who executed his designs support help
