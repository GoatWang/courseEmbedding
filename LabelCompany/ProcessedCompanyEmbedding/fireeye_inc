been slowing significantly and thats likely the single biggest driver behind the stocks dramatic underperformance its expansion pace peaked in  at  before plunging to  in fiscal  and hitting  last year revenue gains even dipped into negative territory at one point but have rebounded slightly ceo kevin mandia and his executive team are forecasting nearzero growth in the second quarter before a more substantial acceleration comes in the second half of the year feye gross profit margin ttm data by ycharts gross margin fireeyes profitability is ultimately a function of how well its nextgen security solutions can stand out against the competition especially those large rivals with the resources to offer lowerpriced security products as part of a more comprehensive it management solution these pressures have resulted in lower selling prices lately as gross profit margin fell to near  of sales from a peak of  of sales rival palo alto networks nysepanw is enjoying consistently higher results the key to improvement on this metric is that fireeye must continually introduce new product and subscription offerings like its recent isight analytics platform that better meet the needs of its customers feye operating margin ttm data by ycharts operating margin as it grapples with the new reality of slowing sales gains fireeye has turned its attention to slicing costs it has made good progress on this score with operating expenses falling to  of sales last quarter from  a year ago fireeye has a tight balance to strike here though as it sharply reduces spending on sales and marketing and on research and development its important that it brings costs in line with its growth forecast but executives dont want to cut so deeply that they threaten the companys longterm

the next few quarters feye current deferred revenue quarterly data by ycharts deferred revenue fireeyes deferred revenue represents invoiced but not yet booked contracts since this metric includes the companys software billings it is a key predictor of future sales deferred revenue growth has slowed to a crawl recently and last quarter it declined for the first time in over two years palo alto networks by contrast booked a  spike in deferred revenue last quarter and is projecting sales gains of as much as  in the current quarter fireeye believes it will manage a rebound in the second half of the year though and thats why billings will be a critical number to watch over the coming quarters the companys best shot at improving its growth pace is in adding new customers ideally through

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in

fireeye nasdaq feye is embracing a servicebased business model the cybersecurity firm offers its customers a wide variety of different products mostly physical and cloudbased appliances and subscription services designed to be used in conjunction with them a customer might purchase one of fireeyes nx boxes for example then pair it with fireeyes dynamic threat intelligence cloud subscription service demand for fireeyes products and services has risen rapidly in recent years and fueled the companys growth but fireeyes future could center on a different sort of offering fireeyeasaservice faas offers the core functions of its security platform in a more flexible way in recent quarters demand for faas has accelerated tremendously and management is optimistic about its longterm potential  faas is boosting standalone subscription revenuefireeye announced faas in the fall of  by blending fireeyes technology intelligence and expertise into a single ondemand offering fireeye as a service simplifies and consolidates the disparate patchwork of products and services organizations must piece together to defend themselves ceo dave dewalt said since then faas has emerged as a key driver for the company in  we built faas into a  million business in less than  months grew it at over  and scaled to hundreds of customers dewalt said on the companys february earnings call in fiscal  fireeye generated platform billings of  million about  of which came from the sale of what fireeye terms standalone product subscriptions faas falls into that category along with its email threat prevention solution management expects that figure to rise to  this year as its platform billings exceed  million source fireeye the companys management believes faas is attractive to customers for several reasons theres the issue of accounting with faas enterprise customers can record the cost as operating expense rather than a capital expense on their books they have more flexibility in terms of deployment so they are able to more easily scale up or scale down to meet their needs and faas taps fireeyes network of security experts who provide additional security oversight  lofty growth targetsfireeye has been a volatile stock since it entered the public markets in the fall of  the company hasnt been profitable nor does it expect to be in the near
