include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these

value when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments we may have to invest the proceeds from prepaid investments including mortgage backed investments in other investments with less attractive terms and yields interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond

principal payments we may have to invest the proceeds from prepaid investments including mortgage backed investments in other investments with less attractive terms and yields interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond
