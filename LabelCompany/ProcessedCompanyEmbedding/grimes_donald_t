fairclough james l fischer robert s folsom james p leake james m nolan and jim a watson stephen e jenkins of ashby  geddes wilmington for appellee dsc communications corporation before veasey cj walsh holland hartnett and berger jj constituting the court en banc  veasey chief justice in this appeal we address the following issues  the distinction between a direct claim of a stockholder and a derivative claim  a direct claim of alleged abdication by a board of directors of its statutory duty  when a presuit demand in a derivative suit is required or excused and  the consequences of demand by a stockholder and the refusal by the board to act on such a demand we hold that the court of chancery correctly dismissed this stockholder action for the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted where the plaintiff stockholder a asserted a direct claim that the directors abdicated their statutory duty to manage or direct the management of the business and affairs of the corporation by entering various employment contracts the agreements with the chief executive officer ceo providing that the ceo shall be responsible for the general management of the affairs of the company and further providing that the ceo can declare a constructive termination of the employment agreement for unreasonable interference by the board with the ceo b made a presuit demand on the board to abrogate the agreements the demand was refused and the stockholder thereafter sought to assert other legal theories relating to the agreements arguing that demand was excused we hold as follows first an abdication claim can be stated by a stockholder as a direct claim as distinct from a derivative claim but here the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted second when a stockholder demands that the board of directors take action on a claim allegedly belonging to the corporation and demand is refused the stockholder may not thereafter assert that demand is excused with respect to other legal theories in support of the same claim although the stockholder may have a remedy for wrongful refusal or may submit further demands which are not repetitious accordingly on the state of this record we affirm the dismissal of this action by the court of chancery i the facts cl grimes grimes plaintiff belowappellant appeals from the dismissal for failure to state a claim of his complaint against james l donald donald the ceo and the board of directors the board of dsc communications corporation dsc or the company grimes seeks a declaration of the invalidity of the agreements between donald and the company he also seeks an award of damages against donald and other members of the board he alleges that the board has breached its fiduciary duties by abdicating its authority failing to exercise due care and committing waste the following facts have been drawn from the face of the complaint the company is a delaware corporation headquartered in plano texas a suburb of dallas the company whose shares are traded on the nasdaq national market system designs manufactures markets and services telecommunication systems the agreements executed during  are the focus of the complaint the employment agreement provides that donald shall be responsible for the general management of the affairs of the company  and that donald shall report to the board the  employment agreement runs until the earlier of donalds th birthday or his termination  by reason of death or disability  for cause or  without cause under the employment agreement donald can declare a constructive termination without cause by the company of his employment as a result of inter alia unreasonable interference in the goodfaith judgment of  donald by the board or a substantial stockholder of the company in donalds carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the employment agreement a constructive termination without cause takes effect after delivery of notice by donald and the failure by the board to remedy such interference in the event of a termination without cause constructive or otherwise donald is entitled to the following  continued payment of his base salary at the level in effect immediately prior to termination for the remainder of his term of employment which as stated will be ½ years unless donald dies or turns  first in  donalds base salary exceeded   annual incentive awards for the remainder of the term of employment equal to the average of the three highest annual bonuses awarded to donald during his last ten years as ceo in  such award allegedly equaled   medical benefits for donald and his wife for life as well as his children until the age of   continued participation in all employee benefit plans in which donald is participating on the date of termination until the earlier of the expiration of the term of employment or the date on which he receives equivalent benefits from a subsequent employer  other unidentified benefits in accordance with dscs plans and programs see amcpltex  § d grimes v donald delch  deljcorpl    wl   the income continuation plan provides inter alia that after base salary payments cease under the employment agreement donald is entitled to receive for the remainder of his life annual payments equal to the average of the sum of his base salary plus bonuses in the three highest years multiplied by  multiplied by his years of service donald has also been awarded  units under the long term incentive plan in the event of a change of control as defined in the incentive plan donald will have the right to cash payments for his units which grimes alleges could total  at the stock price in effect at the time the complaint was filed as required by court of chancery rule  grimes alleges in his complaint that he wrote to the board on september   and demanded that the board abrogate the agreements the demand letter states in part paragraph c of the employment agreement dated as of january   between the company and mr donald purports to vest in mr donald the general management of the affairs of the company under paragraph fvii of the employment agreement mr donald is deemed to have been constructively terminated without cause if there is unreasonable interference in the goodfaith judgment of mr donald by the board or a substantial stockholder of the company in mr donalds carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the agreement paragraph fvii therefore purports to put mr donald in a position unilaterally to declare a constructive termination without cause whenever he declares that the board has unreasonably interfered with his general management of the affairs of the company other provisions including without limitation paragraphs d and  of the employment agreement and paragraph b of the dsc communications corporation executive income continuation plan dated as of january   between the company and mr donald would impose drastic costs and burdens on the company in the event of such a constructive termination without cause  the effect of the cited provision is to delegate the duties and responsibilities of the board of directors to mr donald this delegation is contrary to law and inconsistent with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the company       the cited provisions of the employment agreement are therefore void as a matter of law although they are void they should be abrogated so as to leave no cloud upon the lawful conduct of the companys affairs and it should go without saying that the board must refrain from conducting the business of the company as if they were valid       accordingly i hereby demand that the board of directors take immediate steps to abrogate paragraphs fvii and c of the employment agreement dated as of january   between the company and james l donald and the  longterm incentive compensation plan insofar as it applies to mr donald the board refused the demand in a letter dated november   which states in part the compensation committee of our board of directors as well as the entire board have seriously considered the issues set forth in your letter of september  to assist in the review the board obtained reports analyzing the relevant issues from the companys outside benefits consultant hirschfeld stern moyer  ross inc and from the companys outside legal counsel jones day reavis  pogue the compensation committee and the full board of directors believe that a thorough analysis of the applicable provisions of delaware law necessarily leads to a conclusion that mr donalds duties as described in the employment agreement do not constitute an impermissible delegation of the duties of the board of directors       accordingly the provisions relating to the boards actions set forth in sections d and fvii of the employment agreement simply relate to the consequences of the boards unreasonable interference with mr donalds properly delegated duties these provisions do not limit the boards right to guide the company through the formulation of policy or its right to take any other action it desires to take they simply represent the agreement between the company and mr donald regarding the circumstances that will create a constructive termination of his employment and the consequences of such an event based on the foregoing the board has concluded that the description of mr donalds duties in the employment agreement do not constitute an impermissible delegation of the duties of the board of directors consequently the board declines to take any action to abrogate any provision of the employment agreement or the  longterm incentive compensation plan as you have requested ii grimes has not stated a claim for abdication of directorial duty despite the fact that grimes demanded that the board abrogate the agreements and his demand was refused the court of chancery declined to review the boards decision to refuse the demand under the business judgment rule stating whether these contracts do violate section  is a question of law directly concerning the legal character of the contract and its effect upon the directors the question whether these contracts are valid or not does not fall into the realm of business judgment it cannot be definitively determined by the informed good faith judgment of the board it must be determined by the court grimes  deljcorpl at  citing blasius indus inc v atlas corp delch  ad    which involved a direct action against the board of directors we agree that the court of chancery appropriately analyzed the abdication claim as a direct as distinct from a derivative claim courts have long recognized that the same set of facts can give rise both to a direct claim and a derivative claim bennett v breuil petroleum corp delch  ad     borak v ji case co th cir  fd    affd  us   s ct   l ed d   the due care waste and excessive compensation claims asserted here are derivative and will be considered as such kramer v western pacific indus inc delsupr  ad    the abdication claim however is a direct claim in order to reach this conclusion we believe a further exploration of the distinction between direct and derivative claims is appropriate a distinction between direct and derivative claims generally as the court of chancery has noted although the tests have been articulated many times it is often difficult to distinguish between a derivative and an individual action in re rexene corp shareholders litig delch  deljcorpl    wl   see also abelow v symonds delch  ad    line of distinction  is often a narrow one the distinction depends upon the nature of the wrong alleged and the relief if any which could result if plaintiff were to prevail kramer v western pacific  ad at  quoting elster v american airlines inc delch  ad    to pursue a direct action the stockholderplaintiff must allege more than an injury resulting from a wrong to the corporation id at  the plaintiff must state a claim for an injury which is separate and distinct from that suffered by other shareholders or a wrong involving a contractual right of a shareholder  which exists independently of any right of the corporation moran v household intl inc del ch  ad   affd delsupr  ad   quoting b fletcher cyclopedia corps §  permed the american law institute ali principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations  principles is helpful in this instance section  of the principles undertakes to state the common law with respect to the distinction between direct and derivative actions id §  cmt a the comment also discusses a situation relevant to the case sub judice in some instances actions that essentially involve the structural relationship of the shareholder to the corporation  may also give rise to a derivative action when the corporation suffers or is threatened with a loss one example would be a case in which a corporate official knowingly acts in a manner that the certificate of incorporation or the delaware general corporation law denied the official authority to do thereby violating both specific restraints imposed by the shareholders or the gcl and the officials duty of care id cmt c the comment further notes that courts have been more prepared to permit the plaintiff to characterize the action as direct when the plaintiff is seeking only injunctive or prospective relief id cmt d with respect to the abdication claim grimes seeks only a declaration of the invalidity of the agreements monetary recovery will not accrue to the corporation as a result chancellor seitz illustrated this distinction in bennett the court of chancery there allowed the plaintiffstockholder to proceed individually on his claim that stock was issued for an improper purpose and entrenchment he proceeded derivatively on his claim that the stock was issued for an insufficient price  ad at  b applicable pleading standards since the abdication claim is direct not derivative a motion to dismiss such a claim pursuant to chancery rule b implicates the pleading standard of chancery rule a solomon v pathe communications corp delsupr  ad    neither the pleading standard of chancery rule b circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity nor that of chancery rule  which requires with respect to derivative claims that a plaintiff plead with particularity the efforts if any  to obtain the action the plaintiff desires    and the reasons for the failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort is implicated chancery rule a which is implicated here requires only a short and plain statement of the claim in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a direct claim the court of chancery assumes the truth of wellpleaded

review de novo the decision by the court of chancery on a motion to dismiss a direct claim applying the same legal standard solomon v pathe communications corp  ad at  c analysis of grimes abdication claim in the case before us the abdication claim fails as a matter of law grimes claims that the potentially severe financial penalties which the company would incur in the event that the board attempts to interfere in donalds management of the company will inhibit and deter the board from exercising its duties under section a the court of chancery assumed that if a contract could have the practical effect of preventing a board from exercising its duties it would amount to a de facto abdication of directorial authority the chancellor concluded however that grimes has not set forth wellpleaded allegations which would establish such a situation we agree putting aside the payments which would result from a change of control grimes has pleaded at most that donald would be entitled to  million in the event of a constructive termination the chancellor found in light of the financial size of dsc reflected in the exhibits to the complaint that this amount would not constitute a de facto abdication grimes contends however that the payments could amount to a de facto abdication in possible future circumstances such a set of facts has not been pleaded is not before this court is based on speculation and is not ripe for adjudication directors may not delegate duties which lie at the heart of the management of the corporation chapin v benwood delch  ad    affd sub nom harrison v chapin delsupr  ad   a court cannot give legal sanction to agreements which have the effect of removing from directors in a very substantial way their duty to use their own best judgment on management matters abercrombie v davies delch  ad    revd on other grounds delsupr  ad   distinguishing these cases however the court of chancery stated unlike the agreements considered in abercrombie and chapin the donald agreements do not formally preclude the dsc board from exercising its statutory powers and fulfilling its fiduciary duty grimes  del jcorpl at  compare rosenblatt v getty oil co delsupr  ad    delegation to independent appraiser of responsibility to value oil and gas reserves as part of a merger agreement was proper exercise of business judgment with certain exceptions an informed decision to delegate a task is as much an exercise of business judgment as any other rosenblatt  ad at  likewise business decisions are not an abdication of directorial authority merely because they limit a boards freedom of future action a board which has decided to manufacture bricks has less freedom to decide to make bottles in a world of scarcity a decision to do one thing will commit  a board to a certain course of action and make it costly and difficult indeed sometimes impossible to change course and do another this is an inevitable fact of life and is not an abdication of directorial duty if the market for senior management in the business judgment of a board demands significant severance packages boards will inevitably limit their future range of action by entering into employment agreements large severance payments will deter boards to some extent from dismissing senior officers if an independent and informed board acting in good faith determines that the services of a particular individual warrant large amounts of money whether in the form of current salary or severance provisions the board has made a business judgment that judgment normally will receive the protection of the business judgment rule unless the facts show that such amounts compared with the services to be received in exchange constitute waste or could not otherwise be the product of a valid exercise of business judgment see eg saxe v brady delch  ad    the board of dsc retains the ultimate freedom to direct the strategy and affairs of the company if donald disagrees with the board the company may or may not depending on the circumstances be required to pay him a substantial sum of money in order to pursue its chosen course of action so far we have only a rather unusual contract but not a case of abdication the chancellor correctly dismissed the abdication claim iii grimes demand on the board with respect to the derivative claim conceded that demand was required the complaint alleges that grimes made a presuit demand on the board in the september   letter quoted above in summary the letter described the relevant provisions of the donald agreements and demanded that the board take immediate steps to abrogate the cited sections of the agreements the court of chancery held that by making demand upon the board plaintiff has in effect conceded that the board was in a position to consider and act upon his demand grimes  del jcorpl at  citing spiegel v buntrock delsupr  ad    contending that demand was excused grimes later filed suit alleging waste excessive compensation and due care claims arising out of the agreements but the chancellor held that grimes waived his right to argue that demand was excused with respect to these claims because he had already made demand that the agreements be abrogated as unlawful id we agree a the demand requirement in perspective because the prolix  page complaint tends to confuse the issues in this case it is appropriate to restate as a matter of background the delaware jurisprudence relating to stockholder derivative litigation if a claim belongs to the corporation it is the corporation acting through its board of directors which must make the decision whether or not to assert the claim the derivative action impinges on the managerial freedom of directors pogostin v rice del supr  ad    the demand requirement is a recognition of the fundamental precept that directors manage the business and affairs of the corporation aronson v lewis delsupr  ad     a stockholder filing a derivative suit must allege either that the board rejected his presuit demand that the board assert the corporations claim or allege with particularity why the stockholder was justified in not having made the effort to obtain board action this is a basic principle of corporate governance and is a matter of substantive law embodied in the procedural requirements of chancery rule  one ground for alleging with particularity that demand would be futile is that a reasonable doubt exists that the board is capable of making an independent decision to assert the claim if demand were made the basis for claiming excusal would normally be that  a majority of the board has a material financial or familial interest  a majority of the board is incapable of acting independently for some other reason such as domination or control or  the underlying transaction is not the product of a valid exercise of business judgment if the stockholder cannot plead such assertions consistent with chancery rule  after using the tools at hand to obtain the necessary information before filing a derivative action then the stockholder must make a presuit demand on the board the demand requirement serves a salutary purpose first by requiring exhaustion of intracorporate remedies the demand requirement invokes a species of alternative dispute resolution procedure which might avoid litigation altogether second if litigation is beneficial the corporation can control the proceedings third if demand is excused or wrongfully refused the stockholder will normally control the proceedings  the jurisprudence of aronson and its progeny is designed to create a balanced environment which will  on the one hand deter costly baseless suits by creating a screening mechanism to eliminate claims where there is only a suspicion expressed solely in conclusory terms and  on the other hand permit suit by a stockholder who is able to articulate particularized facts showing that there is a reasonable doubt either that a a majority of the board is independent for purposes of responding to the demand or b the underlying transaction is protected by the business judgment rule aronson introduced the term reasonable doubt into corporate derivative jurisprudence some courts and commentators have questioned why a concept normally present in criminal prosecution would find its way into derivative litigation yet the term is apt and achieves the proper balance reasonable doubt can be said to mean that there is a reason to doubt this concept is sufficiently flexible and workable to provide the stockholder with the keys to the courthouse in an appropriate case where the claim is not based on mere suspicions or stated solely in conclusory terms b wrongful refusal distinguished from excusal demand has been excused in many cases in delaware under the aronson test the law regarding wrongful refusal is  not as well developed however although delaware law does not require demand in every case because delaware does have the mechanism of demand excusal it is important that the demand process be meaningful therefore a stockholder who makes a demand is entitled to know promptly what action the board has taken in response to the demand a stockholder who makes a serious demand and receives only a peremptory refusal has the right to use the tools at hand to obtain the relevant corporate records such as reports or minutes reflecting the corporate action and related information in order to determine whether or not there is a basis to assert that demand was wrongfully refused in no event may a corporation assume a position of neutrality and take no position in response to the demand kaplan v peat marwick mitchell  co delsupr  ad   if a demand is made the stockholder has spent one but only one arrow in the quiver the spent arrow is the  right to claim that demand is excused the stockholder does not by making demand waive the right to claim that demand has been wrongfully refused simply because the composition of the board provides no basis ex ante for the stockholder to claim with particularity and consistently with rule  that it is reasonable to doubt that a majority of the board is either interested or not independent it does not necessarily follow ex post that the board in fact acted independently disinterestedly or with due care in response to the demand a board or a committee of the board may appear to be independent but may not always act independently if a demand is made and rejected the board rejecting the demand is entitled to the presumption of the business judgment rule unless the stockholder can allege facts with particularity creating a reasonable doubt that the board is entitled to the benefit of the presumption if there is reason to doubt that the board acted independently or with due care in responding to the demand the stockholder may have the basis ex post to claim wrongful refusal the stockholder then has the right to bring the underlying action with the same standing which the stockholder would have had ex ante if demand had been excused as futile see stepak v addison th cir  fd   c application to this case in the case before the court plaintiff made a presuit demand later however plaintiff contended that demand was excused under the doctrine articulated by this court in spiegel v buntrock plaintiff by making a demand waived his right to contest the independence of the board as the court of chancery properly held plaintiff may not bifurcate his theories relating to the same claim thus demand having been made as to the propriety of the agreements it cannot be excused as to the claim that the agreements constituted waste excessive compensation or was the product of a lack of due care the court of chancery implicitly applied a test analogous to res judicata to determine whether grimes demand letter conceded that demand was required for all legal theories arising out of the set of facts described in the demand letter we believe this to be a correct approach the alternative claims raised in the complaint fit squarely within the same transactional rubric as the demand since all of the claims however denominated arise out of the agreements as the court of chancery stated there is little to recommend a process in which a shareholder seeks board consideration of only some aspects of a transaction or puts forward only selected theories for board consideration while reserving other theories for judicial consideration such a process would be neither efficient nor fair grimes  deljcorpl at  the same concerns are expressed in the restatement second of judgments which asserts that fairness to the defendant and sound judicial administration require that at some point litigation over the particular controversy come to an end restatement second of judgments §  cmt a  since the making of a presuit demand concedes  that demand is required the concession should apply to all or any part of the transaction or series of connected transactions out of which the action demand arose id §  see foltz v pullman inc delsuper  ad    in spiegel this court held that a shareholder who makes a demand can no longer argue that demand is excused  ad at  permitting a stockholder to demand action involving only one theory or remedy and to argue later that demand is excused as to other legal theories or remedies arising out of the same set of circumstances as set forth in the demand letter would create an undue risk of harassment in this case the board of dsc considered and rejected the demand after investing the time and resources to consider and decide whether or not to take action in response to the demand the board is entitled to have its decision analyzed under the business judgment rule unless the presumption of that rule can be rebutted spiegel  ad at  grimes cannot avoid this result by holding back or bifurcating legal theories based on precisely the same set of facts alleged in the demand since grimes made a presuit demand with respect to all claims arising out of the agreements he was required by chancery rule  to plead with particularity why the boards refusal to act on the derivative claims was wrongful levine v smith  ad at  the complaint recites the boards rejection of grimes demand and proceeds to assert why grimes disagrees with the boards conclusion the complaint generally asserts that the refusal could not have been the result of an adequate good faith investigation since the board decided not to act on the demand such conclusory ipse dixit assertions are inconsistent with the requirements of chancery rule  see levine  ad at  the complaint fails to include particularized allegations which would raise a reasonable doubt that the boards decision to reject the demand was the product of a valid business judgment iv conclusion accordingly the judgment of the court of chancery is affirmed notes  section a provides that the business and affairs of every corporation  shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors  delc § a  the cases cited by grimes involve formal abdication by a board of directors see chapin v benwood foundation inc delch  ad   trustees agreed to appoint particular person to future vacancy on board abercrombie v davies delch  ad   revd on other grounds delsupr  ad   directors agreed to vote unanimously or submit to outside arbitrator  the chancellor perceptively notes that an even more difficult case would be presented where the terms of a ceos employment contract came to have the practical effect of precluding the board from exercising its statutory powers and satisfying its fiduciary duty but that effect was not reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract rights were negotiated at armslength grimes  deljcorpl at  n   the unfortunate choice of language in the employment agreement should not obscure the fact that in many cases large severance payments do not necessarily preclude a formerly passive board from asserting its power over a ceo the court of chancery in dismissing the claim nonetheless disparaged as foolish and illconceived the language of the agreement introducing the concept of the board committing unreasonable interference in the discharge of donalds duties in the good faith judgment of the executive  deljcorpl at  we agree that on the surface this unfortunate choice of words is badly flawed in terms of traditional concepts of corporate governance id when the employment agreement is read as a whole however the initial perception of unlawful delegation gives way to the reality that the agreement is not on its face a wrongful delegation this poor choice of language in the agreements is not actionable per se what actually may happen in the future may or may not ever become a litigable issue that is ripe for adjudication  kamen v kemper fin svcs inc  us    s ct    l ed d   see also fedrcivp   aronson  ad at   id at   rales

of aronson because they are not entitled to discovery to assist their compliance with rule  see levine  ad at  they have many avenues available to obtain information bearing on the subject of their claims for example there is a variety of public sources from which the details of a corporate act may be discovered including the media and governmental agencies such as the securities and exchange

of corporate wrongdoing compaq computer corp v horton delsupr  ad   surprisingly little use has been made of section  as an informationgathering tool in the derivative context perhaps the problem arises in some cases out of an unseemly race to the court house chiefly generated by the first to file custom seemingly permitting the winner of the race to be named lead counsel the result has been a plethora of superficial complaints that could not be sustained nothing requires the court of chancery or any other court having appropriate jurisdiction to countenance this process by penalizing
