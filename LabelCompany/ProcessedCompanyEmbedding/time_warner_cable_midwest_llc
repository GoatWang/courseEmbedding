defendants broadband express llc david dougherty and william pruetts the broadband defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings ecf no  filed on august   and plaintiff rebel lee bretts motion for leave to file an amended complaint instanter ecf no  filed on october   i background in may  plaintiff filed a nineparagraph complaint ecf no  at pageid   against time warner the broadband defendants and the baker defendants in the trumbull county ohio court of common pleas being case no  cv  while plaintiff was employed by broadband express as a cable tv internet and telephone installer he applied for a job at baker installations where he had previously worked  ecf no  at pageid   ¶  the broadband defendants and baker defendants had contractual relations with time warner to provide cable installation services ecf no  at pageid   ¶  installers hired by them are subject to certain policies imposed by time warner including a policy that provides that an installer may not perform installations for time warners accounts if he or she has failed to complete an installation job or has a complaint on his or her record ecf no  at pageid   ¶  the broadband defendants allegedly communicated to time warner that plaintiff had missed performing the very cable installation services that the broadband defendants had been contracted to provide ecf no  at pageid   ¶  the complaint ecf no  at pageid   asserts claims against all defendants for  tortious interference with business relations and  tortious interference with contract related to his attempted employment with baker installations plaintiff alleges he was provisionally hired by baker installations and on or about may   he notified his broadband supervisor defendant william pruett ecf no  at pageid   ¶  as a direct and proximate result of the negligent and reckless conduct of the defendants plaintiff has not been able to secure a cable installation job and has been deprived of his livelihood ecf no  at pageid   ¶  the broadband defendants removed the case to this court on june   on the basis of diversity jurisdiction see notice of removal ecf no  at pageid   ¶¶  ii plaintiffs motion for leave ecf no  according to plaintiff this case was hastily filed on may   in the trumbull county common pleas court with the intent to file an amended complaint for service on the defendants ecf no  at pageid   see also affidavit of irene makridis ecf no  at pageid   ¶  plaintiff however did not properly move the court for leave to file an amended complaint until october   over five months later when he filed the within motion see order ecf no  plaintiff attached to his motion the proposed amended complaint ecf no  in the proposed amendment plaintiff seeks to correct typographical errors and incorrect grammar and syntax that appear in the complaint ecf no  at pageid   and add three  claims  defamation against all defendants third claim for relief  promissory estoppel against the baker defendants only fourth claim for relief and  against public policy specifically violation of good faith and fair dealing against the baker defendants only fifth claim for relief ecf no  at pageid   the broadband defendants and baker defendants oppose plaintiffs motion for leave to amend see ecf nos  and  the court has been advised having reviewed the record the parties briefs and the applicable law the court has also considered the oral arguments of counsel offered during the telephonic status conference held on october   for the reasons set forth below the court denies plaintiffs motion fed r civ p a mandates that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires as stated by the supreme court in the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment futility of amendment etc—the leave sought should as the rules require be freely given foman v davis  us    brown v chapman  fd   th cir  under rule a the court has discretion in allowing amendments robinson v mich consol gas co  fd   th cir  decisions as to when justice requires amendment are left to the sound discretion of the trial judge in reviewing plaintiffs motion for leave it is necessary to weave in additional facts plaintiff contends broadband express withheld the return of his time warner id badge so that it could not be released to his prospective employer baker installations and thus plaintiff could not be hired by baker installations plaintiff alleges that on may   he returned his equipment including his id badge to broadband express the badge had been issued to him by time warner ecf no  at pageid   ¶¶  he also alleges that broadband express refused to return his badge to time warner knowing that the return of the badge was necessary for baker installations to hire him ecf no  at pageid   ¶  during the telephonic status conference held on october   the court was informed that time warner was not told that plaintiff had not completed a job assigned to him by the broadband defendants the court was also advised that plaintiffs id badge was returned to time warner on may   and that plaintiff was only ineligible for hire by baker installations to do installations for time warner for four  days a motion for leave to amend a complaint should not be granted where the proposed amended pleading would be futile see eg midkiff v adams county regional water dist  fd   th cir  a motion to amend is deemed futile if the proposed amendment could not withstand a rule b motion to dismiss debolt v cassens transport co no cv  wl  at  nd ohio aug   pearson j quoting rose v hartford underwriters ins co  fd   th cir  the court concludes that filing the proposed amended complaint ecf no  would be futile as it still fails to state any legally cognizable claim against any defendant a dougherty and pruett the proposed amended complaint ecf no  still fails to state a claim against dougherty and pruett plaintiff has failed to identify any misconduct allegedly perpetrated by these defendants that ties them to any claim alleged by plaintiff see unger v city of mentor  fedappx   th cir  affirming dismissal of claims against a defendant where the complaint lacked factual specificity citing bell atlantic corp v twombly  us    b first claim for relief the proposed amended complaint ecf no  is futile because it fails to state a claim for tortious interference with business relations the elements essential to recovery for a tortious interference with a business relationship are  a business relationship  the wrongdoers knowledge thereof  an intentional interference causing a breach or termination of the relationship and  damages resulting therefrom wolf v mcculloughhyde memorial hosp inc  ohio appd    see also moore v rubin no t  wl  at  ¶  ohio app th dist sept   wauseon plaza ltd partnership v wauseon hardware co  ohio appd   ¶   the main distinction between tortious interference with a contractual relationship and tortious interference with a business relationship is that interference with a business relationship includes intentional interference with prospective contractual relations not yet reduced to a contract diamond wine  spirits inc v dayton heidelberg distrib co inc  ohio appd   ¶  citation omitted the proposed amended complaint ecf no  does not set forth an allegation that time warner and the broadband defendants took any action with the intent of causing a breach in plaintiffs relationship with baker installations in fact the proposed amended complaint ecf no  neglects to include any facts whatsoever regarding the broadband defendants interactions with baker installations see wright safety co v us bank na no   wl  at  ¶  ohio app th dist dec   defendants actions even if improper did not amount to intentional interference with plaintiffs relations with another institution when there were no allegations that defendant or its employees had any interactions with another institution plaintiff alleges that time warner and the broadband defendants intentionally or recklessly and negligently interfered with plaintiffs prospective relationship with defendant baker ecf no  at pageid   ¶  this lone attempt by plaintiff to salvage this claim fails because it is a mere recitation of an element of the cause of action and cannot survive a rule b motion to dismiss ashcroft v iqbal  us    see also wilkey v hull  fedappx   th cir  applying ohio law stating an allegation that a party interfered with certain unspecified business relationships is just a legal conclusion    absent some factual allegation that the tortfeasors actions ended or prevented a business relationship a b dismissal is proper internal quotation marks omitted moreover the alleged interference must be intentional because ohio does not recognize negligent interference with a business relationship diamond wine  spirits  ohio appd   ¶  quoting bauer v commercial aluminum cookware co  ohio appd    c second claim for relief the allegations in proposed amended complaint ecf no  also fail to carry plaintiffs burden of pleading the essential elements of a tortious interference with contract claim in order to recover for a claim of intentional interference with a contract one must prove  the existence of a contract  the wrongdoers knowledge of the contract  the wrongdoers intentional procurement of the contracts breach  the lack of justification and  resulting damages kenty v transamerica premium ins co  ohio std   paragraph two of the syllabus the proposed amended complaint ecf no  fails to adequately allege the first second and third elements it does not allege  the existence of an actual or prospective contract or  that a defendant was aware of a contract between plaintiff and any of the other defendants or  facts that a defendant intentionally interfered with plaintiffs contract with either time warner or any of the baker defendants a denial of the motion for leave is also appropriate because plaintiff has not alleged that the communications between the broadband defendants and time warner lacked privilege statements between parties concerning a common business interest may be protected by a qualified privilege mills van lines inc v prudential real estate and relocation servs nos    wl  at  ¶  ohio app th dist aug   citing evely v carlon co div of indian head inc  ohio std    see also

occurs only when a defendant without privilege to do so induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to enter into or continue business relations or a contract or with another a  babell elevator co v columbuscent ohio bldg  constr trades council  ohio std    ohio imposes the burden of proving lack of privilege or improper interference on the plaintiff  bolivar llc v zarnas  ohio misc lexis  at  ct of common pleas cuyahoga county sept   citing super sulky inc v us trotting assn  fd   th cir  once a defendant demonstrates the existence of the qualified privilege a plaintiff can only prevail upon a showing of actual malice in the communication mills van lines  wl  at  ¶  citing hanley v riverside methodist hosp  ohio appd    the proposed amended complaint ecf no  does not and cannot meet this burden because the broadband defendants communications to time warner are privileged and plaintiff has not alleged actual malice to overcome the qualified common business interest privilege d third claim for relief the proposed amended complaint ecf no  is also futile because it fails on its face to state a claim for defamation in order to sustain a claim for defamation a plaintiff must demonstrate  a false and defamatory statement  about plaintiff  published without privilege to a third party  with fault of at least negligence on the part of the defendant and  that was either defamatory per se or caused special harm to the plaintiff davis v jacobs  ohio appd    quoting gosden v louis  ohio appd    plaintiff has not met this burden in the proposed amended complaint ecf no  in several ways first plaintiff does not identify a false and defamatory statement because he does not identify what false information that a defendant allegedly submitted to an information tracking system see ecf no  at pageid   ¶  second plaintiff does not identify who owns the information tracking system into which a defendant allegedly submitted false information and therefore has not adequately pleaded that any false and defamatory statement was actually published to a third party third for the reasons set forth above in section iic plaintiff has failed to allege how or why any communications between the defendants would not be covered by qualified privilege knox v neaton auto products mfg inc  fd   th cir  citing hahn v kotten  ohio std    fourth plaintiff has not alleged how any such defamation caused him any harm plaintiff alleges in ¶  of the proposed amended complaint ecf no  that he was denied employment at baker installations because of his time warner id badge not returned — he does not allege that he was denied employment because of any statement made by time warner or any of the broadband defendants thus plaintiff has not identified any harm he suffered as a result of the alleged defamation e fourth claim for relief the allegations in the proposed amended complaint ecf no  fail to carry plaintiffs burden of pleading the essential elements of a promissory estoppel claim against the baker defendants to establish such a claim a plaintiff must show that  the employer made a clear unambiguous promise  the plaintiff relied on that promise  the reliance was justifiable and  the reliance caused detriment to the plaintiff odonnell v coulson  fsuppd   nd ohio  oliver j dismissing claim for promissory estoppel where the alleged promise was not clear and unambiguous plaintiff alleges in ¶  of the proposed amended complaint ecf no  that he interviewed with defendants quinton peagler and christine sheridan who promised to hire him at defendant baker — pending approval from defendant time warner emphasis added it is undisputed that plaintiff did not secure the cable installation job with baker installations as a matter of ohio law the proposed amended complaint ecf no  fails to adequately allege the first element and accordingly the fourth claim for relief fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted fed r civ p b as for this first prong according to ohio law a promissory estoppel claim cannot be premised on a conditional promise when the condition at issue never occurs see eg cincinnati fluid power inc v rexnord inc  fd   th cir  conditional promise can serve as basis of estoppel claim only if condition is satisfied prior to action taken in reliance on that promise citation omitted see also eg andersons inc v consol inc  fsuppd   nd ohio  carr j to be clear and unambiguous the promise cannot be conditional citing cases given that the fourth claim for relief is premised on a conditional promise and the condition at issue never occurred the proposed amended complaint ecf no  also fails to adequately allege the second element cincinnati fluid power  fd at  conditional promise alleged was not a reasonable basis for reliance and thus not a proper basis for estoppel citation omitted assuming arguendo that the purported promise of baker installations was not conditional the fourth claim for relief would nevertheless fail for the additional reason that it is precluded by wellestablished ohio law governing such claims in the context of atwill employment relationships because ohio is an atwill employment state a promissory estoppel claim in such cases must be premised on a specific promise of continued employment godfrey v mastec inc case no cv  wl  at  sd ohio nov   dismissing promissory estoppel claim plaintiff alleges the baker defendants and specifically defendant quentin peagler and defendant christine sheridan promised plaintiff new employment with improved conditions if he returned and worked for defendant baker ecf no  at pageid   ¶  an offer for atwill employment by the baker defendants under the facts alleged by plaintiff precludes a claim for promissory estoppel because it falls far short of a specific promise of continued employment f fifth claim for relief the fifth claim for relief in the proposed amended complaint ecf no  is futile this claim is styled as against public policy and attempts to assert a claim against the baker defendants on the grounds that defendants quentin peagler and christine sheridan allegedly never told plaintiff that defendant time warner had not received his badge from defendant broadband express — but told him instead that defendant time warner cable would not hire him because of an incomplete installation job report by defendant broadband ecf no  at pageid   ¶  but that allegation is to be read in conjunction with ¶  of the proposed amended complaint ecf no  assuming that plaintiffs allegation that the broadband defendants reported to defendant time warner that plaintiff had not completed installation jobs he was assigned to is true peagler and sheridan were simply communicating the reasons they had been provided by time warner — nothing more paragraph  and  of the proposed amended complaint ecf no  allege the baker defendants related this information knowing that it is false knowing that it will damage plaintiff and acted contrary to a policy of good faith and fair dealings in the state of ohio and that conduct was willful and wanton with intent to injure plaintiff who reasonably relied on their honesty and good faith however plaintiff provides no additional allegations in the proposed amended complaint ecf no  as to how or why the statements allegedly made by peagler and sheridan to plaintiff were false how or why those statements were made with knowledge of their falsity how those statements were in any way material what action or actions plaintiff allegedly took in reliance on those statements or how any such reliance could have been justified or reasonable for these reasons and those that have been articulated in the memoranda of points and authorities on which the
