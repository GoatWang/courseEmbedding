kittle david l scott angela m scott and michael a stafford plaintiffsappellants v no  muskegon circuit court lc no cz dalton township defendantappellee advance sheets version and muskegon county intervenorappellee  before markey pj and bandstra and murray jj bandstra j in these consolidated cases and appeals plaintiffs are taxpayers who own real property against which defendant dalton township imposed what it called a “special assessment” to raise money for a sewer project the primary issue raised on this appeal the resolution of which disposes of the appeals is one of jurisdiction did the lower court here have jurisdiction to decide whether the special assessments were properly imposed on plaintiffs or instead did the michigan tax tribunal mtt have exclusive jurisdiction to decide plaintiffs’ claims we conclude that the mtt had exclusive jurisdiction and accordingly we affirm the lower court decision in part reverse it in part and remand because the dispositive issue raised here is one of jurisdiction it is not necessary to recite at length either the facts giving rise to these cases or the substance of plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the propriety of the special assessments briefly stated plaintiffs’ contention is that the special assessments imposed by the township to improve a sewer system far exceed any benefit conferred by that sewer system on the properties against which the assessments were made plaintiffs claim that their constitutional rights were violated in a number of ways and further that the township failed to follow proper procedures under the township public improvement act mcl  et seq as already noted the dispositive issue raised on appeal is one of jurisdiction that presents a question of law that we review de novo white v harrisonwhite  mich app    nwd   the mtt has “exclusive and original jurisdiction” over “a proceeding for direct review of a final decision    of an agency relating to assessment    and a proceeding for a refund or redetermination of a tax levied under the property tax laws of this state” mcl a and b the mtt’s jurisdiction extends to taxpayers’ constitutional arguments that a tax assessment is arbitrary and without foundation wikman v city of novi  mich    nwd   see meadowbrook village assoc v auburn hills  mich app    nwd   “the tax tribunal may    consider claims that an assessment is arbitrary or without foundation even if couched in constitutional terms” johnston v livonia  mich app    nwd   “the tribunal may decide claims framed in constitutional terms alleging that a tax assessment was arbitrary and capricious and without foundation” johnson v michigan  mich app    nwd   “the tax tribunal has equitable jurisdiction and may consider constitutional questions relating to the validity of property tax assessments” grosse ile comm for legal taxation v grosse ile twp  mich app    nwd   michigan tax tribunal has jurisdiction over action alleging that township’s total property tax levy exceeded constitutional limitations similarly allegations that a taxing authority failed to follow statutory procedures for imposing assessments fall within the jurisdiction of the mtt johnston  mich app at  while all these cases undermine plaintiffs’ claim that the mtt did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the constitutional and statutory questions they raise none of them directly confronted the headlee amendment argument that plaintiffs advance that argument is potentially problematic because notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the mtt over the  assessment and tax matters just discussed the headlee amendment to the michigan constitution and its enabling legislation specifically grant the courts jurisdiction over headlee amendment challenges against the imposition of a “tax” const  art  §  mcl a however neither the headlee amendment nor the statute extend jurisdiction to special assessment disputes and generally special assessments are not taxes for the purposes of constitutional tax limitations kadzban v grandville  mich    nwd   niles twp v berrien co bd of comm’rs  mich app    nwd   plaintiffs claim that even though defendant called the contested action here a “special assessment” defendant’s “true purpose” was not to provide sewer service specifically to the affected properties but instead to undertake a “massive infrastructure improvement program” for the general benefit of the broader community thus plaintiff claims that this case really involves the imposition of a “disguised tax” and that at least with respect to their headlee amendment claims against that tax jurisdiction is properly vested in the circuit court we disagree “in determining jurisdiction this court will look beyond a plaintiff’s choice of labels to the true nature of the plaintiff’s claim” manning v amerman  mich app    nwd   “a special assessment is a levy upon property within a specified district although it resembles a tax a special assessment is not a tax in contrast to a tax a special assessment is imposed to defray the costs of specific local improvements rather than to raise revenue for general governmental purposes” kadzban  mich at  citation omitted in blake v metro chain stores  mich    nw   our supreme court set out the test for distinguishing the two “the differences between a special assessment and a tax are that  a special assessment can be levied only on land  a special assessment cannot at least in most states be made a personal liability of the person assessed  a special assessment is based wholly on benefits and  a special assessment is exceptional both as to time and locality” citation omitted plaintiffs have conceded that under factors   and  of the blake analysis this case involves special assessments their only contention under the third blake factor is that a tax is involved here because the benefit being derived by the impacted parcels of property is greatly disproportionate to the costs imposed against those parcels in light of that concession we do not conclude that notwithstanding the fact that the township called its action a special assessment it was so clearly a tax instead that jurisdiction was conferred on the court under the headlee provisions we note that the claims plaintiffs raise here are similar to those considered by our supreme court in wikman  mich at  plaintiffs’ claim is that these special assessments were not made according to the benefits received as required by law the resolution of this claim involves many fact determinations the membership of the tax tribunal is structured to provide it with experience in resolving these fact issues the tribunal’s de novo review gives it the opportunity to rectify any errors in the agency’s determination  similar fact issues underlie plaintiffs’ claim here that the special assessments were in fact a disguised tax subject to the headlee amendment thus it is appropriate for the tax tribunal to initially consider plaintiffs’ claim of an alleged violation of the headlee amendment in the context of their challenge to the special assessments any decision by the tax tribunal will be subject to judicial review on appeal to the extent that the trial court determined it had subjectmatter jurisdiction regarding plaintiffs’ claims that defendant failed to properly follow statutory procedural requirements we reverse and remand to the extent that the trial court otherwise determined that it was without jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ claims we affirm neither party having fully prevailed no costs should be imposed mcr  srichard a bandstra sjane e markey schristopher m murray  search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google news google news archive yahoo news find a
