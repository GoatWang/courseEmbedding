hemp report i hemp report i  march st  in  dewmar international formed the united states hemp corporation llc as a subsidiary with a mission to become a best of breed incubator for hemp brands and products in the usa we are proud to announce the us hemp corporation ushc is making a lot of progress since its incorporation the company recently launched wwwushempcorporationcom as its consumer website the website offers a selection of the finest hemp beverages on the market including canna energy cswiss hemp iced tea and chillo hemp energy all of these products that we fulfill from ushc now are available for sale on amazoncom the  farm bill aka the agricultural act of  included a provision to allow some people to begin growing industrial hemp provided it is for “purposes of research conducted under an agricultural pilot program or other agricultural or academic research” and complies with state law  the economics alone are enough to convince anyone  despite the fact that hemp farming has been illegal the us is the world’s biggest consumer of it importing  million worth in  with predicted doubledigit percentage growth  i believe that “a major change is coming” and my goal is to position dewmar to be one of the first few companies to take full advantage of the wealth of opportunities early on as change occurs to properly position the company in addition to the website and products the us hemp corporation launched the hemp incubator it is the only industrial hemp focused business incubator in the world with the us hemp corporation office in denver and manufacturing near boulder we believe the location for the hemp incubator is ideal we selected colorado for the location of the hemp incubator because the area is known as the “silicon valley of food” and “epicenter of lohas” it is at the nexus of the industrial hemp movement that is sweeping america particularly with hemp consumer products we are excited to announce the hemp incubator is fully operating and working to bring several products to market hemp brownies the firsttomarket product that will come out of the hemp incubator is our hempprotein brownie eligible for sale in all  states  dewmar and hemp inc otcpink hemp have partnered to improve this marvelous brand of brownie making them healthier tastier and more moist than ever we are working on final packaging and labeling and are ordering additional machinery to help handle increased manufacturing volumes and efficiency we urge all persons interested in being one of the first to gain access to an order of our brownies to subscribe for our newsletter on our corporate website’s home page  dewmar international and our brownie comanufacturing partner have discussed providing routine tours of our fda regulated bakery for our investor community or simply to fans of our product some time later this year after we have ramped up production and have met our backlog demand on days that we may not be actively running batches of our brownies we will send out an email blast to all registered subscribers about this opportunity as it surfaces cbd hemp seeds and research the us hemp corporation team is currently performing research and duediligence on a variety of cannabinoid based therapeutics the primary cannabinoid we are researching is cannabidiol cbd to date more than  states and washington dc have enacted law to legalize cannabidiol and other medical cannabis products we believe cbds offer incredible potential in both their healing applications and growing market demand we invite universities research institutions distribution channels and other businesses who are interested in cbds to contact the ushc the us hemp corporation understands the importance and need to help farmers gain access to seed and industrial hemp processing technology the ushc will continue its efforts to work with companies universities and state departments of agriculture in these areas through the hemp incubator  i have spent much time over the past several months meeting with leading researchers at a number of top universities across the country that have taken specific interests in new developments in cbd particularly in the states of louisiana colorado and mississippi i have toured a number of existing and potential grow facilities mip licensed facilities medical cannabis manufacturing facilities and research labs dewmar is currently actively seeking such facilities to lease or purchase as a long term investments for research partnerships grants and new product developments along with some of the brightest scientific minds in the industry politically i am striving to make all of the right connections on the local state and federal government levels to put our company in a position to become more readily involved in cbd research hemp farming nutraceuticals cosmoceutical and possibly even pharmaceuticals as it relates to the medicinal and industrial hemp movement  expect to see more developments in the upcoming months regarding these newly cultivated relationships as chair of the mississippi district export council i currently have immediate access to two very active staff members of the mississippi department of agriculture  commerce as part of my committee  the state of mississippi is making great strides and increased interest in the industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis movement recently ushc became a member of the hemp industries association hia and is a part of the mississippi chapter which has a strong presence to lobby statewide government officials the mission of the hia is to represent the interests of the hemp industry and to encourage the research and development of new hemp products currently walmartcom sales over  hemp products of which only  of these products are within the food department i will speak in greater detail in our future ceo message regarding our updated walmart efforts and our plans to increase the hemp product lines for the worlds largest retailer our goal would be to grow various strains of hemp with a primary focus on high cbd low thc hemp oils for new product developments we have already confirmed with top seed researchers in colorado that we can have a pure high cbdlow thc hemp strain genetically customized for the  varied regions of mississippi – gulf coast sands fertile piney woods and the flat planes mississippi delta if we are successful at growing our own hemp plants to have a high seed protein yield we would prefer to manufacture our hempbased products in america and disseminate them across the country and abroad to counter the heavy importing of hemp oils from countries such as china or canada the long term objective is for dewmar to be managing one of the largest industrial and organic hemp farms in the state of mississippi dewmar international recently became a member of louisiana state university’s dean circle since dewmar has received the prestigious lsu award in  i have been having contact with a number chemists and the graduate studies program to test chemical compounds for further research  i am glad to announce that we are now taking this a step further as i am now working with a top research scientist and plant geneticist from the pharmaceutical industry within lsu’s lbtc business incubator in sampling various cbd oil water solubility enzyme technologies  i am hopeful to work with their leading researcher to potentially produce the first line of watersoluble cbd organic juices and functional food lines to help improve the health and quality of lives of individuals throughout the world we anticipate to work closely with the lsu agcenter food incubator over the next few years to conduct food and beverage rd for potential new product launches industry events as a part of the website and hemp incubator launches the ushc has attended multiple hemp industry events to establish its brand and services below are some of the recent events the ushc has attended november th  the naturally boulder networking night was designed to connect professionals in the colorado natural food industry the us hemp corporation met with industry leaders to discuss fda labeling requirements food manufacturing and distribution channels november th  the indo expo show was a fullspectrum cannabis event with exhibitors featuring cannabis cultivation technology lifestyle education industry services and industrial hemp  the us hemp corporation joined fellow us based hemp businesses to build and support connections between wholesalers retailersbuyers and the

participants about upcoming industrial hemp related legislation congressman jared polis provided an update on hemp legislation being proposed at the federal level for updates on his proposed legislation please see below january th  the rvc hemp pitch academy was a halfday workshop designed to polish investor pitches sharpen business strategy and provide a background on what investors are looking for and negotiating a successful deal the pitch academy designed in partnership with our friends at the rocky mountain hemp association was specifically for “hempreneurs” who are building companies within the rapidly growing industrial hemp sector in colorado  i personally gained much insight at this conference on the fledgling companies entering the hemp industry meeting a top hemp seed researcher from colorado state university to share ideas was a bonus my goal is to find some companies young enough to work into the auspices of ushc’s hemp incubator and we find the next diamond in the rough before they are exposed to potentially harmful and greedy investors who don’t put the best interest of the entrepreneur and their products first this also gave me many ideas on how to help finance the efforts of ushc without causing any dilution for dewmar investors hemp investor briefing march th  the hemp investor briefing showcased opportunities for investors interested in the hemp industry the hour lunch briefing provided participating investors with indepth knowledge about the diverse opportunities in the industrial hemp space the event was sponsored by the rocky mountain
