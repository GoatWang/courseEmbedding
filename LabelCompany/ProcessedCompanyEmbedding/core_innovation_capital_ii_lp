whitepaper  you can download it here slicing up the gecko the cliff notes insurance is going to be the next revolution in fintech just as startups have begun to dismantle retail banking consumerfocused technologyfirst companies will redefine how we shop for purchase use and even think about insurance in this post i’d like to air some speculative ideas i’ve had about insurance specifically for middleclass and workingclass folks and also explain why we care so much about such a hidebound industry building a safety net for all americans imagine the daily lives of americans what goes wrong we get into car accidents our roofs are blown away by hurricanes our tvs are stolen we die these are the traditional problems that insurance tries to solve for but there are others aren’t there our cars break down unexpectedly a phone is stolen a job is lost or hours cut back many of the problems that cause folks to utilize incredibly expensive shortterm credit can be alleviated by insurance – at a radically lower cost basically by defraying the risk over a larger population the trick is figuring out how to sell an extended vehicle warranty in a market in which all extended warranties today are scams or how to sell a wage insurance policy that workers can actually believe in aspiring to stability i’ve been puzzling over a new pew survey that asked americans about their hopes and dreams in the context of their financial lives  “when asked whether it was more important to them to have financial stability or to move up the income ladder  percent of americans choose security an increase of  percentage points since ” the mythical ethos of america is that we are a nation of strivers constantly trying to make it big catch a break risk it all to get ahead maybe this was always a myth — but it’s become even more mythical since the  financial crisis and recession even during the socalled recovery from   of americans — that’s  million people — changed their priorities to focus on keeping what they have not getting more refocusing on the big problems that’s a big shift smart new insurance and savings products should and will be created to meet this growing demand with my investing hat on i am excited about many of the deals core is seeing with my civic hat on i think many americans are struggling many startups are working to alleviate the symptoms but few are addressing the biggest problems what does it mean to have a “good job” today what kind of a life should the average american aspire to what kind of economic systems and processes and perhaps companies can imbue the next generation with the grit character and creativity they need to flourish in a time of great technological progress — and economic upheaval i am optimistic that we will find a way and that technology can help us build solutions to the biggest problems but they are hard how could technology solve unemployment or reduce income inequality or ensure an economic baseline for all americans as we have looked deeply at insurance i am reminded again of how much change is yet to come — and how much possibility remains for growth and development   ← show me the
