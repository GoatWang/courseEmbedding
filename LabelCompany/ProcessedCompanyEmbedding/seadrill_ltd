seadrill ltd sdrl a suitable pick for value investors july    am edt by zacks equity research zackscom shutterstock photo value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment after all who wouldnt want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value one way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process lets put seadrill limited sdrl stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for valueoriented investors right now or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks pe ratio a key metric that value investors always look at is the price to earnings ratio or pe for short this shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world the best use of the pe ratio is to compare the stocks current pe ratio with a where this ratio has been in the past b how it compares to the average for the industrysector and c how it compares to the market as a whole on this front seadrill has a trailing twelve months pe ratio of  as you can see in the chart below this level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large as the pe for the sp  stands at about  if we focus on the longterm pe trend seadrills current pe level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years moreover the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock over the past five years suggesting it might be a good entry point further the stocks pe also compares highly favorably with the zacks classified oil  gas drilling industrys trailing twelve months pe ratio which stands at  at the very least this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now compared to its peers ps ratio another key metric to note is the pricesales ratio this approach compares a given stocks price to its total sales where a lower reading is generally considered better some people like this metric more than other valuefocused ones because it looks at sales something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings right now seadrill has a ps ratio of about  this is considerably lower than the sp  average which comes in at  right now if anything sdrl is trading at the lower end of its range in the time period from a ps metric suggesting some level of undervalued tradingat least compared to historical norms broad value outlook in aggregate seadrill currently has a zacks value style score of a putting it into the top  of all stocks we cover from this look this makes seadrill a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too for example the pricebook pb ratio for seadrill limited is  a level that is lower than the industry average of  the price to book ratio or pb is calculated as market capitalization divided by its book value additionally its pcf ratio another great indicator of value comes in at  which is better than the industry average of  clearly sdrl is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles what about the stock overall though seadrill might be a good choice for value investors there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name in particular it is worth noting that the company has a growth grade of d and a momentum score of a this gives sdrl a zacks vgm scoreor its overarching fundamental gradeof b you can read more about the zacks style scores here   meanwhile the current quarter has seen one upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to none downward while the current year estimate has seen three upward and no downward revisions in the same time frame as a result the current quarter consensus estimate now stands at break even from a loss of  cent per share two months ago meanwhile the current year estimate has narrowed from a loss  cents per share to a loss of  cents per share you can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below seadrill limited price and consensus seadrill limited price and consensus  seadrill limited quote this somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has a zacks rank  buy and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term bottom line seadrill is an inspired choice for value investors as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front moreover a strong industry rank top  out of more than  industries and a zacks rank  further support the growth potential of the stock however over the past two years the zacks oil  gas drilling industry has clearly underperformed the broader market as you can see below so value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first but once that happens this stock could be a compelling pick moreover broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well will you make a

longshort equity special situationssummaryseadrill is standing with its back to the wall the company needs to restructure its balance sheet and it needs to do so fastthe company has said recently that negotiations with lenders have not yet been successful but that may change moving forwardalmost all negative outcomes are now priced into the stock lending a lot of upside to seadrill in case a restructuring agreement is reachedsdrl remains a speculative buynegative investor sentiment with respect to offshore drilling contractor seadrill ltd nysesdrl is off the charts after the company gave an illreceived restructuring update at the end of january investors dumped the stock and kicked it into the bargain bin i think that bad news are now sufficiently priced into seadrills shares and that the offshore drilling company will be able to secure lender concessions and a financing package therefore seadrills shares are a speculative buy when it comes to selecting investments with compelling rewardtorisk combinations one wouldnt necessarily come up with offshore drilling companies the sector has been plagued by oversupply issues lower contracting rates and a cutback in investment spending on the part of big oil and gas companies that has thrown the offshore drilling sector into chaos seadrill has pushed back against those market forces by suspending its dividend slashing operating costs for rigs and deferring capital expenditures nonetheless seadrill  still  has a significant amount of debt sitting on its balance sheet and that needs to be serviced the company reported  billion in net interest bearing debt at the end of the september quarter which is all that investors see these days but seadrill should not be counted out just yet source stockchartscom seadrill should be able to secure lender concessions and a financing package in a nutshell seadrills capital structure is unsustainable and needs to change and it needs to change fast in an effort to put the company on more stable financial footing it has entered into negotiations with lenders to transition to a new capital structure which would include the extension of bank maturities the amendment of financial covenants and raising new capital of at least  billion seadrill also wants to extend the maturity of unsecured claims in the restructuring update the offshore drilling company provided in january seadrill said that negotiations with creditors were ongoing and difficult but that they have not yielded positive results yet what ticked investors off was the notion that seadrill was actively preparing various contingency plans in case negotiations would go nowhere and creditors would not want to play a role in sdrls ongoing restructuring after the announcement of the restructuring update the shares slumped  percent reflecting concerns that seadrill may slide into bankruptcy that said though a lot of energy companies have been supported by their lenders during the energy market downturn tilting the odds in favor of a restructuring solution for seadrill also as far as i am concerned chances are that seadrill will be able to hammer out an agreement with its lenders shortly and be able to raise new capital before the west eminence credit facility matures in april your takeaway seadrill will report fourthquarter earnings on thursday and the company will likely give investors an update about its restructuring and the progress it has made in terms of securing concessions from lenders while there are certainly some bumps ahead in the road for seadrill i think the company will ultimately be able to come to an agreement with its creditors and transition its capital structure to one that is more sustainable over the long haul almost the entire set of negative restructuring outcomes are now priced into seadrills shares leaving a lot of headroom for a fast and hard recovery if the company reports a mutually beneficial restructuring agreement speculative buy
