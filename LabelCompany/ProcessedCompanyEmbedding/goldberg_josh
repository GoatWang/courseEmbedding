more sales with email courses you are here home  marketing  rube goldberg’s product launch formularube goldberg’s product launch formula september   by josh leave a comment ever heard of rube goldberg mr goldberg was an engineer and inventor but what really made him famous is his cartoons hed diagram out these outlandish machines that chained together water wheels and tiny steam locomotives and even the occasional octopus… just to accomplish some braindead simple task like his “simple way to uncork a bottle” which involved an elephant a bag of peanuts a monkey and a sleeping dog just for starters you can see it here hilarious stuff if youve got a geeky engineering side like me and it reminds me of a marketing funnel i saw a few days ago… this was for a product launch in the a dating niche i dont work in this niche at all but this was one of the few nonsleazy products in that space the launch was clearly a ton of work to put together the product sells for  and typically the higher the price the more copy you need to make the sale and oh man did they ever have copy thousands and thousands of dollars worth huge long sales page  emails for the inhouse list plus more for affiliates facebook ads landing pages webinar scripts it got to be so complex that the copywriter sat down and spent a few hours drawing the whole thing out in a workflow diagram fills  pages of letter sized paper really well done too the programmer in me is proud… heres the thing though theyre halfway through the launch now and… its failing theyve made a few sales but not nearly what they were expecting ouch the copywriter was looking for some quick help to get his launch off life support hes in a tough spot the clock is ticking—he has  days to make this thing work no time to make drastic changes to the complex machinery that theyve built i suggested making some quick tweaks to the offer—like announcing some surprise bonuses and definitely talking to people who had seen the offer and decided to pass maybe they can sweeten the deal and salvage the launch thats just a bandaid at best though from what i can see the real problem here is that the marketer got caught up in the machinery for the launch… and now he has this huge contraption with  moving parts and its pretty difficult to tell what the weak links are thats why its smart to build your funnel one piece at a time starting with the basics a source of traffic a way to capture email addresses a sales page that makes a clear offer and an email sequence that sends people back to that sales page over and over yes complex funnels are often necessary by starting simple though you can see whether the extra complexity actually helps you… or whether youre just enlisting an entire zoo to help you pop open a bottle of champaign related posts how to prevent the ‘product launch postpartum blues” with email courses product launches are dang near magical its like some kind of spell falls over your audience that makes them go into a buying frenzy for my very first product launch i had a rinkydink list of just  people yet somehow from that tiny list i made something like  how to launch a product and fall flat on your face so last week i did just about the dumbest thing yet in my career as an email marketer heres what happened… recently my business partner john and i launched a new product for simple programmer a short video course called  ways to make money from your blog now it help my product launch is over and sales have stopped before we had electricity internal combustion engines and nuclear power the entire world

goldberg home tilting back the light • acrylic on canvas • ″x″ •  in preparation is the setting forth the leaving behind the teacher the teaching the explanations the expectations the preconceptions the narrow field of my vision no longer are memories words or images to mean what they used to mean if i think i know what i will find i will find nothing if i expect nothing i will always be surprised this is the painter’s path of liberation abstract art my philosophy of painting – “the painter’s path” – is about process rather than product ie painting as a “finished object” process painting directs one’s unplanned actions totally toward the flow of the work leaving the painter in a state of “unknowing” and surprise process painting is spontaneous and grown rather than constructed its resolution is an undeniable presence which confronts us waiting and enduring selfexisting and selfsufficient however one has to be willing to shipwreck the work to explode it in order for the work to become what it is to reveal nothing outside itself what i look for in this “nomethod method” process contradictions in composition where there are multiple spaces each with its own focal point and perspective paradoxes in brushwork close to daoist and zen actions that seem in opposition as loaded gestural sweeps approach finely polished areas a variety of strong contrasts of darks and lights simple and complex shapes paintings within paintings as a contemporary abstract painter i work with forms in space the kind of forms and their placement creates the tension and energy between them holding together the structural balance of the visual surface color flattens gives the illusion of depth dissolves or unifies these elements – space form pattern atmosphere color and brushwork the carefully rendered and the explosive – are pulled from the outer limits of the canvas or paper into a nucleus forever floating and interacting whether using acrylics or charcoal charcoal combined with ink chalk or other mediums the subject is the paint or charcoal itself my paintings are abstract visions of imaginary places in highly structured compositions and loose and sumptuous paint they veer from the monumental to the microscopic conjure soaring mountains or placid pools of water but these paintings “are less about a real place than they are about our ideas of nature the way the landscape looks inside our heads long after we’ve left it behind and returned to the city” the hand is evident throughout the canvas in the scraped surface revealing what lies underneath in the horizontal drips of wet paint and in the pooling of color on the surface it is in the fragmented asymmetry and in the quickening of the calligraphic brush that the scene is endowed with an “asian sense of the sacred” comments are closed
