years war netherlands wessagusset colony plymouth colony spouses rose standish barbara standish signature myles standish c  – october   was an english military officer hired by the pilgrims as military adviser for plymouth colony he accompanied them on the mayflower journey and played a leading role in the administration and defense of plymouth colony from its inception on february   the plymouth colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life standish served as an agent of plymouth colony in england as assistant governor and as treasurer of the colony he was also one of the first settlers and founders of the town of duxbury massachusetts a defining characteristic of standishs military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes on different groups of native americans—the nemasket raid and the conflict at wessagusset colony during these actions standish exhibited considerable courage and skill as a soldier but also demonstrated a brutality that angered native americans and disturbed more moderate members of the colony one of standishs last military actions on behalf of plymouth colony was the botched penobscot expedition in  by the s he relinquished his role as an active soldier and settled into a quieter life on his duxbury farm he was still nominally the commander of the pilgrim military forces in the growing colony although he seems to have preferred to act in an advisory capacity he died in his home in duxbury in  at age  he supported and defended the pilgrims colony for much of his life though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church several towns and military installations have been named for standish and monuments have been built in his memory one of the best known depictions of him in popular culture was the  poem the courtship of miles standish by henry wadsworth longfellow the highly fictionalized story presents him as a timid romantic it was extremely popular in the th century and played a significant role in cementing the pilgrim story in us culture

standish little is definitively known of myles standishs origin and early life his place of birth has been subject to debate among historians for more than  years at the center of the debate is language in his will drafted in plymouth colony in  regarding his rights of inheritance standish wrote i give unto my son  heire apparent alexander standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in ormskirke ormskirk borscouge burscough wrightington maudsley mawdesley newburrow newburgh crowston croston and in the isle of man sic to the west of croston and given to mee as right heire by lawfull decent but surruptuously detained from mee my great grandfather being a cond or younger brother from the house of standish of standish the places named by standish are all in lancashire england with the exception of the isle of man leading some to conclude that he was born in lancashire—possibly in the vicinity of chorley where a branch of the standish family owned a manor known as duxbury hall however efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to the standishes of duxbury hall a competing theory focuses on his mention of the isle of man and argues that he belonged to a manx branch of the standish family no definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace possibly the best source however brief on standishs origin and early life is a short passage recorded by nathaniel morton secretary of plymouth colony who wrote in his new englands memorial published in  that standish was a gentleman born in lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of standish in his younger time he went over into the low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with the church at leyden and came over into new england with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of new plymouth and bare a deep share of their first difficulties and was always very faithful to their interest sir horatio vere was the commander of english troops in holland during the siege of sluis in  under whom standish likely served the circumstances are vague at best concerning standishs early military career in holland the low countries to which morton referred at the time the dutch republic was embroiled in the eighty years war with spain queen elizabeth i of england chose to support the protestant dutch republic and sent troops to fight the spanish in holland historians are divided on his role in the english military nathaniel philbrick refers to standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in holland but justin winsor claims that standish received a lieutenants commission in the english army and was subsequently promoted to captain in holland jeremy bangs a leading scholar of pilgrim history noted that standish likely served under sir horatio vere an english general who had recruited soldiers in both lancashire and the isle of man among other places and who led the english troops in holland at the time when standish was there whether commissioned officer mercenary or both standish apparently came to holland around  and according to historian tudor jenks may have seen service during the siege of sluis in  in which veres english troops were involved the subsequent twelve years truce – between spain and the dutch republic might have ended standishs service standish was certainly still in holland in  and living in leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee puritan dissenters from england to act as their adviser on military matters at that time he was using the title of captain when considering candidates for this important position the puritans had at first hoped to engage captain john smith one of the founders of the english colony at jamestown virginia who had also explored and mapped the north american coast they approached him to return to the new world and he expressed interest his experience made him an attractive candidate but the pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator standish lived in leiden with his wife rose and was apparently already known to them voyage to new plymouthedit the embarkation of the pilgrims  us capitol rotunda myles and rose standish are prominently depicted in the foreground on the right on july   old style date the initial group of english dissenters living in leiden boarded the speedwell which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in england this initial group included the mostly brownist congregation myles and rose standish were aboard along with the bradfords winslows carvers and others the small ton pinnace sailed to southampton with about  passengers to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the new world another  passengers would board the ton mayflower the speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays but both vessels departed southampton august  the leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking which had caused them to return to port twice the standishes and most of the speedwell passengers crowded into the mayflower and the speedwell went on to london to be resold now with only a few passengers she subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to the new world the mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees and finally departed plymouth england on september   bound for the northern part of the virginia colony the passage of the mayflower across the north atlantic lasted more than two months with  passengers crowded onto the cargo ships gun deck and about  crew members the seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but by the second month the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage there were two deaths but this was just a precursor to what happened after their cape cod arrival when almost half the company died in the first winter the mayflower compact a painting by jean leon gerome ferris on november   lookouts spotted land but it was quickly appreciated that their location was about  miles eastnortheast of their planned destination of northern virginia near what is now called cape cod they tried briefly to sail south but strong seas forced them to retreat to cape cod to harbor near the hook of presentday provincetown harbor it became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south so they decided to settle near cape cod shortage of supplies including wood and beer and the roaring atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a virginia landing they anchored at the hook on november  but not before signing a significant document the leaders of the colony wrote the mayflower compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle myles standish was one of the  men who signed the document establishment of plymouth colonyedit when the mayflower was anchored off cape cod standish urged the colonys leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement on november   he led  men in a foot exploration of the northern portion of the cape on december  a group of  settlers including standish made an extended exploration of the shore of cape cod by boat spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches the settlers were attacked one night by a group of about  native americans at first the englishmen panicked but standish calmed them urging the settlers not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily the incident took place in presentday eastham massachusetts and came to be known as the first encounter after further exploration the pilgrims chose a location in presentday plymouth bay in late december  as the site for their settlement standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility only one house consisting of a single room had been built when illness struck the settlers of the roughly  who first arrived only  survived the first winter standishs wife rose died in january standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and william bradford soon to be governor of plymouth colony credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered standish tended to bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a decadeslong friendship bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and by necessity worked closely with standish the two men were opposites in terms of character bradford was patient and slow to judgment while standish was well known for his fiery temper despite their differences the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose defense of plymouth colonyedit by february  the colonists had sighted native americans several times but there had been no communication the men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on february   consisting of all ablebodied men electing standish as their commander the leaders of plymouth colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process the men of plymouth colony continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life as captain of the militia standish regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets contact with the native americans came in march  through samoset an englishspeaking abenaki who arranged for the pilgrims to meet with massasoit the sachem of the nearby pokanoket tribe on march  the first governor of plymouth colony john carver signed a treaty with massasoit declaring an alliance between the pokanoket and the englishmen and requiring the two parties to defend each other in times of need governor carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor william bradford bradford and standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the pilgrims and the pokanokets from tribes such as the massachusetts and the narragansetts as threats arose standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals such behavior at times made bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the pokanokets nemasket raidedit an  lithograph depicting the expedition against nemasket led by standish and guided by hobbamock the first challenge to the treaty came in august  when a sachem named corbitant began to undermine massasoits leadership corbitant worked to turn the people of nemasket against massasoit in the pokanoket village of nemasket now the site of middleborough massachusetts about  miles  km west of plymouth bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in nemasket tisquantum known to the english as squanto and hobbamock tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the pilgrims ensuring the survival of the colony hobbamock another influential ally was a pniese—a highranking advisor to massasoit—and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among native americans when tisquantum and hobbamock arrived in nemasket corbitant took tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him hobbamock escaped to warn plymouth bradford and standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the englishpokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly on august   standish led a group of  men to nemasket determined to kill corbitant they were guided by hobbamock who quickly befriended standish and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives in his old age hobbamock became part of standishs household in duxbury reaching nemasket standish planned a night attack on the wigwam in which corbitant was believed to be sleeping that night he and hobbamock burst into the shelter shouting for corbitant as frightened pokanokets attempted to escape englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets wounding a pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to plymouth to be treated standish soon learned that corbitant had already fled the village and tisquantum was unharmed standish had failed to capture corbitant but the raid had the desired effect on september   nine sachems came to plymouth including corbitant to sign a treaty of loyalty to king james palisadeedit plimoth plantation a replica reconstruction of the original pilgrim village in plymouth massachusetts including the palisade surrounding the settlement in november  a narragansett messenger arrived in plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin the pilgrims were told by tisquantum and hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from narragansett sachem canonicus the narragansetts lived west of narragansett bay in presentday rhode island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated taking the threat seriously standish urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs the proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or  km long in addition standish recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall the colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship fortune but there were still only  men to work on the task despite the challenges the settlers constructed the palisade per standishs recommendations in just three months finishing in march  standish divided the militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack wessagussetedit a more serious threat came from the massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of english colonists in april  the vanguard of a new colony arrived in plymouth they had been sent by merchant thomas weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near plymouth the men chose a site on the shore of the fore river in presentday weymouth massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth they called their colony wessagusset the settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness by march  massasoit had learned that a group of influential massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the wessagusset and plymouth colonies massasoit warned the pilgrims to strike first one of the colonists of wessagusset named phineas pratt verified that his settlement was in danger pratt managed to escape to plymouth and reported that the english in wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the massachusetts that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation bradford called a public meeting at which the pilgrims decided to send standish and a small group of eight including hobbamock to wessagusset to kill the leaders of the alleged plot to wipe out the english settlements the mission had a personal aspect for standish one of the warriors threatening wessagusset was wituwamat a neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened standish arriving at wessagusset standish found that many of the englishmen had gone to live with the massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to wessagusset pecksuot was a massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening wessagusset he came to the settlement with wituwamat and other warriors the day after standishs arrival standish claimed simply to be in wessagusset on a trading mission but pecksuot said to hobbamock let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares later in the day pecksuot approached standish looking down on him and said you are a great captain yet you are but a little man though i be no sachem yet i am of great strength and courage the next day standish arranged to meet with pecksuot over a meal in one of wessagussets oneroom houses pecksuot brought with him a third warrior named wituwamat wituwamats adolescent brother and several women standish had three men of plymouth and hobbamock with him in the house on an arranged signal the english shut the door of the house and standish attacked pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with the mans own knife wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed leaving the house standish ordered two more massachusett warriors to be put to death gathering his men standish went outside the walls of wessagusset in search of obtakiest a sachem of the massachusett tribe the englishmen soon encountered obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued during which obtakiest escaped having accomplished his mission standish returned to plymouth with wituwamats head the leaders of the alleged plot to destroy the english settlements had been killed and the threat removed but the action had unexpected consequences the settlement of wessagusset was all but abandoned after the incident which standish had been trying to protect most of the settlers departed for an english fishing post on monhegan island the attack also caused widespread panic among native americans throughout the region villages were abandoned and the pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time pastor john robinson was still in leiden but he criticized standish for his brutality bradford too was uncomfortable with his methods but he defended him in a letter as for capten standish we leave him to answer for him selfe but this we must say he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have and as carefull of the generall good dispersal of merrymount settlersedit from a thcentury dutch manual on the use of the arquebus a type of matchlock used by the pilgrims in  another group of english settlers established an outpost not far from the site of wessagusset located in what is now quincy massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth the settlement was officially known as mount wollaston but soon earned the nickname merrymount their leader thomas morton encouraged behavior that the pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous the men of merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe the sabbath and sold weapons to native americans bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered standish to lead an expedition to arrest morton in  standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building morton eventually decided to attack the men from plymouth but the merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons morton aimed a weapon at standish which the captain purportedly ripped from his hands standish and his men took morton to plymouth and eventually sent him back to england later morton wrote the book new english canaan in which he referred to myles standish as captain shrimp and wrote i have found the massachusetts indians more full of humanity than the christians penobscot expeditionedit standishs last significant expedition was against the french having defended plymouth from native americans and englishmen the french established a trading post in  on the penobscot river in what is now castine maine english forces captured the settlement in  and turned it over to plymouth colony it was a valuable source of furs and timber for the pilgrims for seven years however in  the french mounted a small expedition and easily reclaimed the settlement william bradford ordered captain standish to take action determined that the post be reclaimed in plymouth colonys name this was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which standish had previously led and to accomplish the task he chartered the ship good hope captained by a man named girling standishs plan appears to have been to bring the good hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the french into surrender unfortunately girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board standish gave up the effort by this time the neighboring and more populous massachusetts bay colony had been established bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in boston for help in reclaiming the trading post but the bay colony refused the incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies in  the two colonies merged to become the royal province of massachusetts bay settlement in duxburyedit the alexander standish house still standing built by myles standishs son on the captains farm in duxbury massachusetts in  plymouth colony leaders appointed standish to travel to london to negotiate new terms with the merchant adventurers if a settlement could be reached and the pilgrims could pay off their debt to the adventurers then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to plymouth in april  another effort was successful later in  this time negotiated by isaac allerton and several leading men of plymouth including standish paid off the colonys debt to the adventurers the leaders of plymouth colony were now free of the directives of the merchant adventurers and they exerted their newfound autonomy by organizing a land division in  large farm lots were parceled out to each family in the colony along the shore of the presentday towns of plymouth kingston duxbury and marshfield massachusetts standish received a farm of  acres  ha in what became duxbury he built a house and settled there around  there are indications that standish began to seek a quieter life by  after the penobscot expedition maintaining the livestock and fields of his duxbury farm he was about  years old at that time and he began to relinquish the responsibility of defending the colony to a younger generation a note in the colony records of  indicates that lieutenant william holmes was appointed to train the militia as standishs immediate subordinate when the pequot war loomed in  standish was appointed to a committee to raise a company of  men but it was holmes who led the company in the field the families living in duxbury sometimes duxborough asked to be set off from plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister this request was granted in  historian justin winsor and others have insisted that the name of duxbury was given by standish in honor of duxbury hall near chorley in lancashire which was owned by a branch of the standish family the coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it though no records exist to indicate how the town was named last yearsedit standish grave site in the myles standish cemetery in duxbury during the s standish took on an increasingly administrative role he served as a surveyor of highways as treasurer of

employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by henry wadsworth longfellow in his narrative poem the courtship of miles standish historian tudor jenks wrote that longfellows book had no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old plymouth however the book elevated standish to the level of folk hero in victorian america in late th century duxbury the book generated a movement to build monuments in standishs honor a beneficial byproduct of which was increased tourism to the town the first of these monuments was the largest the cornerstone was laid for the myles standish monument in duxbury in  with a crowd of ten thousand people attending the ceremonies it was finished in  the third tallest monument to an individual in the united states it is surpassed only by the first dedicated washington monument  feet in baltimore maryland finished in  and the washington monument  feet

standishs grave in  two exhumations of standishs remains were undertaken in  and  to determine the location of the captains resting place a third exhumation took place in  to place standishs remains in a hermetically sealed chamber beneath the gravesite monument his burial site is located in myles standish burial ground in duxbury the site of myles standishs house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of duxbury standish maine is named for the captain as well as the neighborhood of standish minneapolis at least two forts were named after standish an earthen fort on plymouths saquish neck built during the american civil war and a larger cement fort built on lovells island in boston harbor

was an english military officer hired by the pilgrims as military adviser for plymouth colony he accompanied them on the mayflower journey and played a leading role in the administration and defense of plymouth colony from its inception on february   the plymouth colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life standish served as an agent of plymouth colony in england as assistant governor and as treasurer of the colony he was also one of the first settlers and founders of the town of duxbury massachusetts a defining characteristic of standishs military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes on different groups of native americans—the nemasket raid and the conflict at wessagusset colony during these actions standish exhibited considerable courage and skill as a soldier but also demonstrated a brutality that angered native americans and disturbed more moderate members of the colony one of standishs last military actions on behalf of plymouth colony was the botched penobscot expedition in  by the s he relinquished his role as an active soldier and settled into a quieter life on his duxbury farm he was still nominally the commander of the pilgrim military forces in the growing colony although he seems to have preferred to act in an advisory capacity he died in his home in duxbury in  at age  he supported and defended the pilgrims colony for much of his life though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church several towns and military installations have been named for standish and monuments have been built in his memory one of the best known depictions of him in popular culture was the  poem the courtship of miles standish by henry wadsworth longfellow the highly fictionalized story presents him as a timid romantic it was extremely popular in the th century and played a significant role in

serviceedit coat of arms of myles standish little is definitively known of myles standishs origin and early life his place of birth has been subject to debate among historians for more than  years at the center of the debate is language in his will drafted in plymouth colony in  regarding his rights of inheritance standish wrote i give unto my son  heire apparent alexander standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in ormskirke ormskirk borscouge burscough wrightington maudsley mawdesley newburrow newburgh crowston croston and in the isle of man sic to the west of croston and given to mee as right heire by lawfull decent but surruptuously detained from mee my great grandfather being a cond or younger brother from the house of standish of standish the places named by standish are all in lancashire england with the exception of the isle of man leading some to conclude that he was born in lancashire—possibly in the vicinity of chorley where a branch of the standish family owned a manor known as duxbury hall however efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to the standishes of duxbury hall a competing theory focuses on his mention of the isle of man and argues that he belonged to a manx branch of the standish family no definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace possibly the best source however brief on standishs origin and early life is a short passage recorded by nathaniel morton secretary of plymouth colony who wrote in his new englands memorial published in  that standish was a gentleman born in lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of standish in his younger time he went over into the low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with the church at leyden and came over into new england with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of new plymouth and bare a deep share of their first difficulties and was always very faithful to their interest sir horatio vere was the commander of english troops in holland during the siege of sluis in  under whom standish likely served the circumstances are vague at best concerning standishs early military career in holland the low countries to which morton referred at the time the dutch republic was embroiled in the eighty years war with spain queen elizabeth i of england chose to support the protestant dutch republic and sent troops to fight the spanish in holland historians are divided on his role in the english military nathaniel philbrick refers to standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in holland but justin winsor claims that standish received a lieutenants commission in the english army and was subsequently promoted to captain in holland jeremy bangs a leading scholar of pilgrim history noted that standish likely served under sir horatio vere an english general who had recruited soldiers in both lancashire and the isle of man among other places and who led the english troops in holland at the time when standish was there whether commissioned officer mercenary or both standish apparently came to holland around  and according to historian tudor jenks may have seen service during the siege of sluis in  in which veres english troops were involved the subsequent twelve years truce – between spain and the dutch republic might have ended standishs service standish was certainly still in holland in  and living in leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee puritan dissenters from england to act as their adviser on military matters at that time he was using the title of captain when considering candidates for this important position the puritans had at first hoped to engage captain john smith one of the founders of the english colony at jamestown virginia who had also explored and mapped the north american coast they approached him to return to the new world and he expressed interest his experience made him an attractive candidate but the pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator standish lived in leiden with his wife rose and was apparently already known to them voyage to new plymouthedit the embarkation of the pilgrims  us capitol rotunda myles and rose standish are prominently depicted in the foreground on the right on july   old style date the initial group of english dissenters living in leiden boarded the speedwell which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in england this initial group included the mostly brownist congregation myles and rose standish were aboard along with the bradfords winslows carvers and others the small ton pinnace sailed to southampton with about  passengers to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the new world another  passengers would board the ton mayflower the speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays but both vessels departed southampton august  the leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking which had caused them to return to port twice the standishes and most of the speedwell passengers crowded into the mayflower and the speedwell went on to london to be resold now with only a few passengers she subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to the new world the mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees and finally departed plymouth england on september   bound for the northern part of the virginia colony the passage of the mayflower across the north atlantic lasted more than two months with  passengers crowded onto the cargo ships gun deck and about  crew members the seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but by the second month the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage there were two deaths but this was just a precursor to what happened after their cape cod arrival when almost half the company died in the first winter the mayflower compact a painting by jean leon gerome ferris on november   lookouts spotted land but it was quickly appreciated that their location was about  miles eastnortheast of their planned destination of northern virginia near what is now called cape cod they tried briefly to sail south but strong seas forced them to retreat to cape cod to harbor near the hook of presentday provincetown harbor it became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south so they decided to settle near cape cod shortage of supplies including wood and beer and the roaring atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a virginia landing they anchored at the hook on november  but not before signing a significant document the leaders of the colony wrote the mayflower compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle myles standish was one of the  men who signed the document establishment of plymouth colonyedit when the mayflower was anchored off cape cod standish urged the colonys leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement on november   he led  men in a foot exploration of the northern portion of the cape on december  a group of  settlers including standish made an extended exploration of the shore of cape cod by boat spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches the settlers were attacked one night by a group of about  native americans at first the englishmen panicked but standish calmed them urging the settlers not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily the incident took place in presentday eastham massachusetts and came to be known as the first encounter after further exploration the pilgrims chose a location in presentday plymouth bay in late december  as the site for their settlement standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility only one house consisting of a single room had been built when illness struck the settlers of the roughly  who first arrived only  survived the first winter standishs wife rose died in january standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and william bradford soon to be governor of plymouth colony credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered standish tended to bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a decadeslong friendship bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and by necessity worked closely with standish the two men were opposites in terms of character bradford was patient and slow to judgment while standish was well known for his fiery temper despite their differences the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose defense of plymouth colonyedit by february  the colonists had sighted native americans several times but there had been no communication the men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on february   consisting of all ablebodied men electing standish as their commander the leaders of plymouth colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process the men of plymouth colony continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life as captain of the militia standish regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets contact with the native americans came in march  through samoset an englishspeaking abenaki who arranged for the pilgrims to meet with massasoit the sachem of the nearby pokanoket tribe on march  the first governor of plymouth colony john carver signed a treaty with massasoit declaring an alliance between the pokanoket and the englishmen and requiring the two parties to defend each other in times of need governor carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor william bradford bradford and standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the pilgrims and the pokanokets from tribes such as the massachusetts and the narragansetts as threats arose standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals such behavior at times made bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the pokanokets nemasket raidedit an  lithograph depicting the expedition against nemasket led by standish and guided by hobbamock the first challenge to the treaty came in august  when a sachem named corbitant began to undermine massasoits leadership corbitant worked to turn the people of nemasket against massasoit in the pokanoket village of nemasket now the site of middleborough massachusetts about  miles  km west of plymouth bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in nemasket tisquantum known to the english as squanto and hobbamock tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the pilgrims ensuring the survival of the colony hobbamock another influential ally was a pniese—a highranking advisor to massasoit—and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among native americans when tisquantum and hobbamock arrived in nemasket corbitant took tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him hobbamock escaped to warn plymouth bradford and standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the englishpokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly on august   standish led a group of  men to nemasket determined to kill corbitant they were guided by hobbamock who quickly befriended standish and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives in his old age hobbamock became part of standishs household in duxbury reaching nemasket standish planned a night attack on the wigwam in which corbitant was believed to be sleeping that night he and hobbamock burst into the shelter shouting for corbitant as frightened pokanokets attempted to escape englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets wounding a pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to plymouth to be treated standish soon learned that corbitant had already fled the village and tisquantum was unharmed standish had failed to capture corbitant but the raid had the desired effect on september   nine sachems came to plymouth including corbitant to sign a treaty of loyalty to king james palisadeedit plimoth plantation a replica reconstruction of the original pilgrim village in plymouth massachusetts including the palisade surrounding the settlement in november  a narragansett messenger arrived in plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin the pilgrims were told by tisquantum and hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from narragansett sachem canonicus the narragansetts lived west of narragansett bay in presentday rhode island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated taking the threat seriously standish urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs the proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or  km long in addition standish recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall the colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship fortune but there were still only  men to work on the task despite the challenges the settlers constructed the palisade per standishs recommendations in just three months finishing in march  standish divided the militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack wessagussetedit a more serious threat came from the massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of english colonists in april  the vanguard of a new colony arrived in plymouth they had been sent by merchant thomas weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near plymouth the men chose a site on the shore of the fore river in presentday weymouth massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth they called their colony wessagusset the settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness by march  massasoit had learned that a group of influential massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the wessagusset and plymouth colonies massasoit warned the pilgrims to strike first one of the colonists of wessagusset named phineas pratt verified that his settlement was in danger pratt managed to escape to plymouth and reported that the english in wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the massachusetts that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation bradford called a public meeting at which the pilgrims decided to send standish and a small group of eight including hobbamock to wessagusset to kill the leaders of the alleged plot to wipe out the english settlements the mission had a personal aspect for standish one of the warriors threatening wessagusset was wituwamat a neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened standish arriving at wessagusset standish found that many of the englishmen had gone to live with the massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to wessagusset pecksuot was a massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening wessagusset he came to the settlement with wituwamat and other warriors the day after standishs arrival standish claimed simply to be in wessagusset on a trading mission but pecksuot said to hobbamock let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares later in the day pecksuot approached standish looking down on him and said you are a great captain yet you are but a little man though i be no sachem yet i am of great strength and courage the next day standish arranged to meet with pecksuot over a meal in one of wessagussets oneroom houses pecksuot brought with him a third warrior named wituwamat wituwamats adolescent brother and several women standish had three men of plymouth and hobbamock with him in the house on an arranged signal the english shut the door of the house and standish attacked pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with the mans own knife wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed leaving the house standish ordered two more massachusett warriors to be put to death gathering his men standish went outside the walls of wessagusset in search of obtakiest a sachem of the massachusett tribe the englishmen soon encountered obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued during which obtakiest escaped having accomplished his mission standish returned to plymouth with wituwamats head the leaders of the alleged plot to destroy the english settlements had been killed and the threat removed but the action had unexpected consequences the settlement of wessagusset was all but abandoned after the incident which standish had been trying to protect most of the settlers departed for an english fishing post on monhegan island the attack also caused widespread panic among native americans throughout the region villages were abandoned and the pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time pastor john robinson was still in leiden but he criticized standish for his brutality bradford too was uncomfortable with his methods but he defended him in a letter as for capten standish we leave him to answer for him selfe but this we must say he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have and as carefull of the generall good dispersal of merrymount settlersedit from a thcentury dutch manual on the use of the arquebus a type of matchlock used by the pilgrims in  another group of english settlers established an outpost not far from the site of wessagusset located in what is now quincy massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth the settlement was officially known as mount wollaston but soon earned the nickname merrymount their leader thomas morton encouraged behavior that the pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous the men of merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe the sabbath and sold weapons to native americans bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered standish to lead an expedition to arrest morton in  standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building morton eventually decided to attack the men from plymouth but the merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons morton aimed a weapon at standish which the captain purportedly ripped from his hands standish and his men took morton to plymouth and eventually sent him back to england later morton wrote the book new english canaan in which he referred to myles standish as captain shrimp and wrote i have found the massachusetts indians more full of humanity than the christians penobscot expeditionedit standishs last significant expedition was against the french having defended plymouth from native americans and englishmen the french established a trading post in  on the penobscot river in what is now castine maine english forces captured the settlement in  and turned it over to plymouth colony it was a valuable source of furs and timber for the pilgrims for seven years however in  the french mounted a small expedition and easily reclaimed the settlement william bradford ordered captain standish to take action determined that the post be reclaimed in plymouth colonys name this was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which standish had previously led and to accomplish the task he chartered the ship good hope captained by a man named girling standishs plan appears to have been to bring the good hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the french into surrender unfortunately girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board standish gave up the effort by this time the neighboring and more populous massachusetts bay colony had been established bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in boston for help in reclaiming the trading post but the bay colony refused the incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies in  the two colonies merged to become the royal province of massachusetts bay settlement in duxburyedit the alexander standish house still standing built by myles standishs son on the captains farm in duxbury massachusetts in  plymouth colony leaders appointed standish to travel to london to negotiate new terms with the merchant adventurers if a settlement could be reached and the pilgrims could pay off their debt to the adventurers then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to plymouth in april  another effort was successful later in  this time negotiated by isaac allerton and several leading men of plymouth including standish paid off the colonys debt to the adventurers the leaders of plymouth colony were now free of the directives of the merchant adventurers and they exerted their newfound autonomy by organizing a land division in  large farm lots were parceled out to each family in the colony along the shore of the presentday towns of plymouth kingston duxbury and marshfield massachusetts standish received a farm of  acres  ha in what became duxbury he built a house and settled there around  there are indications that standish began to seek a quieter life by  after the penobscot expedition maintaining the livestock and fields of his duxbury farm he was about  years old at that time and he began to relinquish the responsibility of defending the colony to a younger generation a note in the colony records of  indicates that lieutenant william holmes was appointed to train the militia as standishs immediate subordinate when the pequot war loomed in  standish was appointed to a committee to raise a company of  men but it was holmes who led the company in the field the families living in duxbury sometimes duxborough asked to be set off from plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister this request was granted in  historian justin winsor and others have insisted that the name of duxbury was given by standish in honor of duxbury hall near chorley in lancashire which was owned by a branch of the standish family the coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it though no records exist to indicate how the town was named last yearsedit standish grave site in the myles standish cemetery in duxbury during the s standish took on an increasingly administrative role he served as a surveyor of highways as treasurer of the colony from  to  and on various committees to lay out boundaries of new towns and inspect waterways his old friend hobbamock had been part of his household but he died in  and was buried on standishs farm in duxbury standish died on october   of strangullion or strangury a condition often associated with kidney stones or bladder cancer

after september   charles  was born by about  he was still living on march   no further record legacyedit myles standish monument in duxbury massachusetts standishs truelife role in defending plymouth colony and the sometimes brutal tactics that he employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by henry wadsworth longfellow in his narrative poem the courtship of miles standish historian tudor jenks wrote that longfellows book had no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old plymouth however the book elevated standish to the level of folk hero in victorian america in late th century duxbury the book generated a movement to build monuments in standishs honor a beneficial byproduct of which was increased tourism to the town the first of these monuments was the largest the cornerstone was laid for the myles standish monument in duxbury in  with a crowd of ten thousand people attending the ceremonies it was finished in  the third tallest monument to an individual in the united states it is surpassed only by the first dedicated washington monument  feet in baltimore maryland finished in  and the washington monument  feet in washington dc dedicated in  the top of the monument is  feet  m overall and at the top stands a foot  m statue of standish a second smaller monument was placed over the alleged site of myles standishs grave in  two exhumations of standishs remains were undertaken in  and  to determine the location of the captains resting place a third exhumation took place in  to place standishs remains in a hermetically sealed chamber beneath the gravesite monument his burial site is located in myles standish burial ground in duxbury the site of myles standishs house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of duxbury standish maine is named for the captain as well as the neighborhood of standish minneapolis at least two forts were named after standish an earthen fort on plymouths saquish neck built during the american civil war and a larger cement fort built on lovells island in boston harbor in  both forts are now abandoned camp myles standish in nearby taunton was also named for standish myles standish state forest is located in the

military officer hired by the pilgrims as military adviser for plymouth colony he accompanied them on the mayflower journey and played a leading role in the administration and defense of plymouth colony from its inception on february   the plymouth colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life standish served as an agent of plymouth colony in england as assistant governor and as treasurer of the colony he was also one of the first settlers and founders of the town of duxbury massachusetts a defining characteristic of standishs military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes on different groups of native americans—the nemasket raid and the conflict at wessagusset colony during these actions standish exhibited considerable courage and skill as a soldier but also demonstrated a brutality that angered native americans and disturbed more moderate members of the colony one of standishs last military actions on behalf of plymouth colony was the botched penobscot expedition in  by the s he relinquished his role as an active soldier and settled into a quieter life on his duxbury farm he was still nominally the commander of the pilgrim military forces in the growing colony although he seems to have preferred to act in an advisory capacity he died in his home in duxbury in  at age  he supported and defended the pilgrims colony for much of his life though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church several towns and military installations have been named for standish and monuments have been built in his memory one of the best known depictions of him in popular culture was the  poem the courtship of miles standish by henry wadsworth longfellow the highly fictionalized story presents him as a timid romantic it was extremely popular in the th century and played a significant role in

serviceedit coat of arms of myles standish little is definitively known of myles standishs origin and early life his place of birth has been subject to debate among historians for more than  years at the center of the debate is language in his will drafted in plymouth colony in  regarding his rights of inheritance standish wrote i give unto my son  heire apparent alexander standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in ormskirke ormskirk borscouge burscough wrightington maudsley mawdesley newburrow newburgh crowston croston and in the isle of man sic to the west of croston and given to mee as right heire by lawfull decent but surruptuously detained from mee my great grandfather being a cond or younger brother from the house of standish of standish the places named by standish are all in lancashire england with the exception of the isle of man leading some to conclude that he was born in lancashire—possibly in the vicinity of chorley where a branch of the standish family owned a manor known as duxbury hall however efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to the standishes of duxbury hall a competing theory focuses on his mention of the isle of man and argues that he belonged to a manx branch of the standish family no definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace possibly the best source however brief on standishs origin and early life is a short passage recorded by nathaniel morton secretary of plymouth colony who wrote in his new englands memorial published in  that standish was a gentleman born in lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of standish in his younger time he went over into the low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with the church at leyden and came over into new england with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of new plymouth and bare a deep share of their first difficulties and was always very faithful to their interest sir horatio vere was the commander of english troops in holland during the siege of sluis in  under whom standish likely served the circumstances are vague at best concerning standishs early military career in holland the low countries to which morton referred at the time the dutch republic was embroiled in the eighty years war with spain queen elizabeth i of england chose to support the protestant dutch republic and sent troops to fight the spanish in holland historians are divided on his role in the english military nathaniel philbrick refers to standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in holland but justin winsor claims that standish received a lieutenants commission in the english army and was subsequently promoted to captain in holland jeremy bangs a leading scholar of pilgrim history noted that standish likely served under sir horatio vere an english general who had recruited soldiers in both lancashire and the isle of man among other places and who led the english troops in holland at the time when standish was there whether commissioned officer mercenary or both standish apparently came to holland around  and according to historian tudor jenks may have seen service during the siege of sluis in  in which veres english troops were involved the subsequent twelve years truce – between spain and the dutch republic might have ended standishs service standish was certainly still in holland in  and living in leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee puritan dissenters from england to act as their adviser on military matters at that time he was using the title of captain when considering candidates for this important position the puritans had at first hoped to engage captain john smith one of the founders of the english colony at jamestown virginia who had also explored and mapped the north american coast they approached him to return to the new world and he expressed interest his experience made him an attractive candidate but the pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator standish lived in leiden with his wife rose and was apparently already known to them voyage to new plymouthedit the embarkation of the pilgrims  us capitol rotunda myles and rose standish are prominently depicted in the foreground on the right on july   old style date the initial group of english dissenters living in leiden boarded the speedwell which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in england this initial group included the mostly brownist congregation myles and rose standish were aboard along with the bradfords winslows carvers and others the small ton pinnace sailed to southampton with about  passengers to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the new world another  passengers would board the ton mayflower the speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays but both vessels departed southampton august  the leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking which had caused them to return to port twice the standishes and most of the speedwell passengers crowded into the mayflower and the speedwell went on to london to be resold now with only a few passengers she subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to the new world the mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees and finally departed plymouth england on september   bound for the northern part of the virginia colony the passage of the mayflower across the north atlantic lasted more than two months with  passengers crowded onto the cargo ships gun deck and about  crew members the seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but by the second month the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage there were two deaths but this was just a precursor to what happened after their cape cod arrival when almost half the company died in the first winter the mayflower compact a painting by jean leon gerome ferris on november   lookouts spotted land but it was quickly appreciated that their location was about  miles eastnortheast of their planned destination of northern virginia near what is now called cape cod they tried briefly to sail south but strong seas forced them to retreat to cape cod to harbor near the hook of presentday provincetown harbor it became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south so they decided to settle near cape cod shortage of supplies including wood and beer and the roaring atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a virginia landing they anchored at the hook on november  but not before signing a significant document the leaders of the colony wrote the mayflower compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle myles standish was one of the  men who signed the document establishment of plymouth colonyedit when the mayflower was anchored off cape cod standish urged the colonys leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement on november   he led  men in a foot exploration of the northern portion of the cape on december  a group of  settlers including standish made an extended exploration of the shore of cape cod by boat spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches the settlers were attacked one night by a group of about  native americans at first the englishmen panicked but standish calmed them urging the settlers not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily the incident took place in presentday eastham massachusetts and came to be known as the first encounter after further exploration the pilgrims chose a location in presentday plymouth bay in late december  as the site for their settlement standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility only one house consisting of a single room had been built when illness struck the settlers of the roughly  who first arrived only  survived the first winter standishs wife rose died in january standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and william bradford soon to be governor of plymouth colony credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered standish tended to bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a decadeslong friendship bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and by necessity worked closely with standish the two men were opposites in terms of character bradford was patient and slow to judgment while standish was well known for his fiery temper despite their differences the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose defense of plymouth colonyedit by february  the colonists had sighted native americans several times but there had been no communication the men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on february   consisting of all ablebodied men electing standish as their commander the leaders of plymouth colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process the men of plymouth colony continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life as captain of the militia standish regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets contact with the native americans came in march  through samoset an englishspeaking abenaki who arranged for the pilgrims to meet with massasoit the sachem of the nearby pokanoket tribe on march  the first governor of plymouth colony john carver signed a treaty with massasoit declaring an alliance between the pokanoket and the englishmen and requiring the two parties to defend each other in times of need governor carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor william bradford bradford and standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the pilgrims and the pokanokets from tribes such as the massachusetts and the narragansetts as threats arose standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals such behavior at times made bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the pokanokets nemasket raidedit an  lithograph depicting the expedition against nemasket led by standish and guided by hobbamock the first challenge to the treaty came in august  when a sachem named corbitant began to undermine massasoits leadership corbitant worked to turn the people of nemasket against massasoit in the pokanoket village of nemasket now the site of middleborough massachusetts about  miles  km west of plymouth bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in nemasket tisquantum known to the english as squanto and hobbamock tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the pilgrims ensuring the survival of the colony hobbamock another influential ally was a pniese—a highranking advisor to massasoit—and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among native americans when tisquantum and hobbamock arrived in nemasket corbitant took tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him hobbamock escaped to warn plymouth bradford and standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the englishpokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly on august   standish led a group of  men to nemasket determined to kill corbitant they were guided by hobbamock who quickly befriended standish and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives in his old age hobbamock became part of standishs household in duxbury reaching nemasket standish planned a night attack on the wigwam in which corbitant was believed to be sleeping that night he and hobbamock burst into the shelter shouting for corbitant as frightened pokanokets attempted to escape englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets wounding a pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to plymouth to be treated standish soon learned that corbitant had already fled the village and tisquantum was unharmed standish had failed to capture corbitant but the raid had the desired effect on september   nine sachems came to plymouth including corbitant to sign a treaty of loyalty to king james palisadeedit plimoth plantation a replica reconstruction of the original pilgrim village in plymouth massachusetts including the palisade surrounding the settlement in november  a narragansett messenger arrived in plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin the pilgrims were told by tisquantum and hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from narragansett sachem canonicus the narragansetts lived west of narragansett bay in presentday rhode island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated taking the threat seriously standish urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs the proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or  km long in addition standish recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall the colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship fortune but there were still only  men to work on the task despite the challenges the settlers constructed the palisade per standishs recommendations in just three months finishing in march  standish divided the militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack wessagussetedit a more serious threat came from the massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of english colonists in april  the vanguard of a new colony arrived in plymouth they had been sent by merchant thomas weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near plymouth the men chose a site on the shore of the fore river in presentday weymouth massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth they called their colony wessagusset the settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness by march  massasoit had learned that a group of influential massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the wessagusset and plymouth colonies massasoit warned the pilgrims to strike first one of the colonists of wessagusset named phineas pratt verified that his settlement was in danger pratt managed to escape to plymouth and reported that the english in wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the massachusetts that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation bradford called a public meeting at which the pilgrims decided to send standish and a small group of eight including hobbamock to wessagusset to kill the leaders of the alleged plot to wipe out the english settlements the mission had a personal aspect for standish one of the warriors threatening wessagusset was wituwamat a neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened standish arriving at wessagusset standish found that many of the englishmen had gone to live with the massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to wessagusset pecksuot was a massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening wessagusset he came to the settlement with wituwamat and other warriors the day after standishs arrival standish claimed simply to be in wessagusset on a trading mission but pecksuot said to hobbamock let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares later in the day pecksuot approached standish looking down on him and said you are a great captain yet you are but a little man though i be no sachem yet i am of great strength and courage the next day standish arranged to meet with pecksuot over a meal in one of wessagussets oneroom houses pecksuot brought with him a third warrior named wituwamat wituwamats adolescent brother and several women standish had three men of plymouth and hobbamock with him in the house on an arranged signal the english shut the door of the house and standish attacked pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with the mans own knife wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed leaving the house standish ordered two more massachusett warriors to be put to death gathering his men standish went outside the walls of wessagusset in search of obtakiest a sachem of the massachusett tribe the englishmen soon encountered obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued during which obtakiest escaped having accomplished his mission standish returned to plymouth with wituwamats head the leaders of the alleged plot to destroy the english settlements had been killed and the threat removed but the action had unexpected consequences the settlement of wessagusset was all but abandoned after the incident which standish had been trying to protect most of the settlers departed for an english fishing post on monhegan island the attack also caused widespread panic among native americans throughout the region villages were abandoned and the pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time pastor john robinson was still in leiden but he criticized standish for his brutality bradford too was uncomfortable with his methods but he defended him in a letter as for capten standish we leave him to answer for him selfe but this we must say he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have and as carefull of the generall good dispersal of merrymount settlersedit from a thcentury dutch manual on the use of the arquebus a type of matchlock used by the pilgrims in  another group of english settlers established an outpost not far from the site of wessagusset located in what is now quincy massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth the settlement was officially known as mount wollaston but soon earned the nickname merrymount their leader thomas morton encouraged behavior that the pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous the men of merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe the sabbath and sold weapons to native americans bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered standish to lead an expedition to arrest morton in  standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building morton eventually decided to attack the men from plymouth but the merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons morton aimed a weapon at standish which the captain purportedly ripped from his hands standish and his men took morton to plymouth and eventually sent him back to england later morton wrote the book new english canaan in which he referred to myles standish as captain shrimp and wrote i have found the massachusetts indians more full of humanity than the christians penobscot expeditionedit standishs last significant expedition was against the french having defended plymouth from native americans and englishmen the french established a trading post in  on the penobscot river in what is now castine maine english forces captured the settlement in  and turned it over to plymouth colony it was a valuable source of furs and timber for the pilgrims for seven years however in  the french mounted a small expedition and easily reclaimed the settlement william bradford ordered captain standish to take action determined that the post be reclaimed in plymouth colonys name this was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which standish had previously led and to accomplish the task he chartered the ship good hope captained by a man named girling standishs plan appears to have been to bring the good hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the french into surrender unfortunately girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board standish gave up the effort by this time the neighboring and more populous massachusetts bay colony had been established bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in boston for help in reclaiming the trading post but the bay colony refused the incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies in  the two colonies merged to become the royal province of massachusetts bay settlement in duxburyedit the alexander standish house still standing built by myles standishs son on the captains farm in duxbury massachusetts in  plymouth colony leaders appointed standish to travel to london to negotiate new terms with the merchant adventurers if a settlement could be reached and the pilgrims could pay off their debt to the adventurers then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to plymouth in april  another effort was successful later in  this time negotiated by isaac allerton and several leading men of plymouth including standish paid off the colonys debt to the adventurers the leaders of plymouth colony were now free of the directives of the merchant adventurers and they exerted their newfound autonomy by organizing a land division in  large farm lots were parceled out to each family in the colony along the shore of the presentday towns of plymouth kingston duxbury and marshfield massachusetts standish received a farm of  acres  ha in what became duxbury he built a house and settled there around  there are indications that standish began to seek a quieter life by  after the penobscot expedition maintaining the livestock and fields of his duxbury farm he was about  years old at that time and he began to relinquish the responsibility of defending the colony to a younger generation a note in the colony records of  indicates that lieutenant william holmes was appointed to train the militia as standishs immediate subordinate when the pequot war loomed in  standish was appointed to a committee to raise a company of  men but it was holmes who led the company in the field the families living in duxbury sometimes duxborough asked to be set off from plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister this request was granted in  historian justin winsor and others have insisted that the name of duxbury was given by standish in honor of duxbury hall near chorley in lancashire which was owned by a branch of the standish family the coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it though no records exist to indicate how the town was named last yearsedit standish grave site in the myles standish cemetery in duxbury during the s standish took on an increasingly administrative role he served as a surveyor of highways as treasurer of the colony from  to  and on various committees to lay out boundaries of new towns and inspect waterways his old friend hobbamock had been part of his household but he died in  and was buried on standishs farm in duxbury standish died on october   of strangullion or strangury a condition often associated with kidney stones or bladder cancer he was buried in duxburys old burying ground now known as the myles standish cemetery  marriages and familyedit myles standish married rose handley – by about  she died on january   she was buried in an unmarked grave at coles hill burial ground in plymouth as were many others who died the first winter she is named on the pilgrim memorial tomb on coles hill as rose first wife of myles standish barbara mullins  by about  per banks she had come to plymouth in  on either the anne or little james and they were married the following spring historians have suggested that she may have been a sister of standishs first wife rose and that he specifically sent for her they had seven children she died after october   and her burial place is unknown  children of myles and barbara standish

after september   charles  was born by about  he was still living on march   no further record legacyedit myles standish monument in duxbury massachusetts standishs truelife role in defending plymouth colony and the sometimes brutal tactics that he employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by henry wadsworth longfellow in his narrative poem the courtship of miles standish historian tudor jenks wrote that longfellows book had no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old plymouth however the book elevated standish to the level of folk hero in victorian america in late th century duxbury the book generated a movement to build monuments in standishs honor a beneficial byproduct of which was increased tourism to the town the first of these monuments was the largest the cornerstone was laid for the myles standish monument in duxbury in  with a crowd of ten thousand people attending the ceremonies it was finished in  the third tallest monument to an individual in the united states it is surpassed only by the first dedicated washington monument  feet in baltimore maryland finished in  and the washington monument  feet in washington dc dedicated in  the top of the monument is  feet  m overall and at the top stands a foot  m statue of standish a second smaller monument was placed over the alleged site of myles standishs grave in  two exhumations of standishs remains were undertaken in  and  to determine the location of the captains resting place a third exhumation took place in  to place standishs remains in a hermetically sealed chamber beneath the gravesite monument his burial site is located in myles standish burial ground in duxbury the site of myles standishs house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of duxbury standish maine is named for the captain as well as the neighborhood of standish minneapolis at least two forts were named after standish an earthen fort on plymouths saquish neck built during the american civil war and a larger cement fort built on lovells island in boston harbor in  both forts are now abandoned camp myles standish in nearby taunton was also named for standish myles standish state forest is located in the

captain commands held plymouth colony militia battleswars eighty years war netherlands wessagusset colony plymouth colony spouses rose standish barbara standish signature myles standish c  – october   was an english military officer hired by the pilgrims as military adviser for plymouth colony he accompanied them on the mayflower journey and played a leading role in the administration and defense of plymouth colony from its inception on february   the plymouth colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life standish served as an agent of plymouth colony in england as assistant governor and as treasurer of the colony he was also one of the first settlers and founders of the town of duxbury massachusetts a defining characteristic of standishs military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes on different groups of native americans—the nemasket raid and the conflict at wessagusset colony during these actions standish exhibited considerable courage and skill as a soldier but also demonstrated a brutality that angered native americans and disturbed more moderate members of the colony one of standishs last military actions on behalf of plymouth colony was the botched penobscot expedition in  by the s he relinquished his role as an active soldier and settled into a quieter life on his duxbury farm he was still nominally the commander of the pilgrim military forces in the growing colony although he seems to have preferred to act in an advisory capacity he died in his home in duxbury in  at age  he supported and defended the pilgrims colony for much of his life though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church several towns and military installations have been named for standish and monuments have been built in his memory one of the best known depictions of him in popular culture was the  poem the courtship of miles standish by henry wadsworth longfellow the highly fictionalized story presents him as a timid romantic it was extremely popular in the th century and played a significant role in

serviceedit coat of arms of myles standish little is definitively known of myles standishs origin and early life his place of birth has been subject to debate among historians for more than  years at the center of the debate is language in his will drafted in plymouth colony in  regarding his rights of inheritance standish wrote i give unto my son  heire apparent alexander standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in ormskirke ormskirk borscouge burscough wrightington maudsley mawdesley newburrow newburgh crowston croston and in the isle of man sic to the west of croston and given to mee as right heire by lawfull decent but surruptuously detained from mee my great grandfather being a cond or younger brother from the house of standish of standish the places named by standish are all in lancashire england with the exception of the isle of man leading some to conclude that he was born in lancashire—possibly in the vicinity of chorley where a branch of the standish family owned a manor known as duxbury hall however efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to the standishes of duxbury hall a competing theory focuses on his mention of the isle of man and argues that he belonged to a manx branch of the standish family no definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace possibly the best source however brief on standishs origin and early life is a short passage recorded by nathaniel morton secretary of plymouth colony who wrote in his new englands memorial published in  that standish was a gentleman born in lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of standish in his younger time he went over into the low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with the church at leyden and came over into new england with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of new plymouth and bare a deep share of their first difficulties and was always very faithful to their interest sir horatio vere was the commander of english troops in holland during the siege of sluis in  under whom standish likely served the circumstances are vague at best concerning standishs early military career in holland the low countries to which morton referred at the time the dutch republic was embroiled in the eighty years war with spain queen elizabeth i of england chose to support the protestant dutch republic and sent troops to fight the spanish in holland historians are divided on his role in the english military nathaniel philbrick refers to standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in holland but justin winsor claims that standish received a lieutenants commission in the english army and was subsequently promoted to captain in holland jeremy bangs a leading scholar of pilgrim history noted that standish likely served under sir horatio vere an english general who had recruited soldiers in both lancashire and the isle of man among other places and who led the english troops in holland at the time when standish was there whether commissioned officer mercenary or both standish apparently came to holland around  and according to historian tudor jenks may have seen service during the siege of sluis in  in which veres english troops were involved the subsequent twelve years truce – between spain and the dutch republic might have ended standishs service standish was certainly still in holland in  and living in leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee puritan dissenters from england to act as their adviser on military matters at that time he was using the title of captain when considering candidates for this important position the puritans had at first hoped to engage captain john smith one of the founders of the english colony at jamestown virginia who had also explored and mapped the north american coast they approached him to return to the new world and he expressed interest his experience made him an attractive candidate but the pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator standish lived in leiden with his wife rose and was apparently already known to them voyage to new plymouthedit the embarkation of the pilgrims  us capitol rotunda myles and rose standish are prominently depicted in the foreground on the right on july   old style date the initial group of english dissenters living in leiden boarded the speedwell which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in england this initial group included the mostly brownist congregation myles and rose standish were aboard along with the bradfords winslows carvers and others the small ton pinnace sailed to southampton with about  passengers to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the new world another  passengers would board the ton mayflower the speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays but both vessels departed southampton august  the leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking which had caused them to return to port twice the standishes and most of the speedwell passengers crowded into the mayflower and the speedwell went on to london to be resold now with only a few passengers she subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to the new world the mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees and finally departed plymouth england on september   bound for the northern part of the virginia colony the passage of the mayflower across the north atlantic lasted more than two months with  passengers crowded onto the cargo ships gun deck and about  crew members the seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but by the second month the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage there were two deaths but this was just a precursor to what happened after their cape cod arrival when almost half the company died in the first winter the mayflower compact a painting by jean leon gerome ferris on november   lookouts spotted land but it was quickly appreciated that their location was about  miles eastnortheast of their planned destination of northern virginia near what is now called cape cod they tried briefly to sail south but strong seas forced them to retreat to cape cod to harbor near the hook of presentday provincetown harbor it became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south so they decided to settle near cape cod shortage of supplies including wood and beer and the roaring atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a virginia landing they anchored at the hook on november  but not before signing a significant document the leaders of the colony wrote the mayflower compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle myles standish was one of the  men who signed the document establishment of plymouth colonyedit when the mayflower was anchored off cape cod standish urged the colonys leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement on november   he led  men in a foot exploration of the northern portion of the cape on december  a group of  settlers including standish made an extended exploration of the shore of cape cod by boat spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches the settlers were attacked one night by a group of about  native americans at first the englishmen panicked but standish calmed them urging the settlers not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily the incident took place in presentday eastham massachusetts and came to be known as the first encounter after further exploration the pilgrims chose a location in presentday plymouth bay in late december  as the site for their settlement standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility only one house consisting of a single room had been built when illness struck the settlers of the roughly  who first arrived only  survived the first winter standishs wife rose died in january standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and william bradford soon to be governor of plymouth colony credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered standish tended to bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a decadeslong friendship bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and by necessity worked closely with standish the two men were opposites in terms of character bradford was patient and slow to judgment while standish was well known for his fiery temper despite their differences the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose defense of plymouth colonyedit by february  the colonists had sighted native americans several times but there had been no communication the men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on february   consisting of all ablebodied men electing standish as their commander the leaders of plymouth colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process the men of plymouth colony continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life as captain of the militia standish regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets contact with the native americans came in march  through samoset an englishspeaking abenaki who arranged for the pilgrims to meet with massasoit the sachem of the nearby pokanoket tribe on march  the first governor of plymouth colony john carver signed a treaty with massasoit declaring an alliance between the pokanoket and the englishmen and requiring the two parties to defend each other in times of need governor carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor william bradford bradford and standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the pilgrims and the pokanokets from tribes such as the massachusetts and the narragansetts as threats arose standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals such behavior at times made bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the pokanokets nemasket raidedit an  lithograph depicting the expedition against nemasket led by standish and guided by hobbamock the first challenge to the treaty came in august  when a sachem named corbitant began to undermine massasoits leadership corbitant worked to turn the people of nemasket against massasoit in the pokanoket village of nemasket now the site of middleborough massachusetts about  miles  km west of plymouth bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in nemasket tisquantum known to the english as squanto and hobbamock tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the pilgrims ensuring the survival of the colony hobbamock another influential ally was a pniese—a highranking advisor to massasoit—and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among native americans when tisquantum and hobbamock arrived in nemasket corbitant took tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him hobbamock escaped to warn plymouth bradford and standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the englishpokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly on august   standish led a group of  men to nemasket determined to kill corbitant they were guided by hobbamock who quickly befriended standish and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives in his old age hobbamock became part of standishs household in duxbury reaching nemasket standish planned a night attack on the wigwam in which corbitant was believed to be sleeping that night he and hobbamock burst into the shelter shouting for corbitant as frightened pokanokets attempted to escape englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets wounding a pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to plymouth to be treated standish soon learned that corbitant had already fled the village and tisquantum was unharmed standish had failed to capture corbitant but the raid had the desired effect on september   nine sachems came to plymouth including corbitant to sign a treaty of loyalty to king james palisadeedit plimoth plantation a replica reconstruction of the original pilgrim village in plymouth massachusetts including the palisade surrounding the settlement in november  a narragansett messenger arrived in plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin the pilgrims were told by tisquantum and hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from narragansett sachem canonicus the narragansetts lived west of narragansett bay in presentday rhode island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated taking the threat seriously standish urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs the proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or  km long in addition standish recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall the colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship fortune but there were still only  men to work on the task despite the challenges the settlers constructed the palisade per standishs recommendations in just three months finishing in march  standish divided the militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack wessagussetedit a more serious threat came from the massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of english colonists in april  the vanguard of a new colony arrived in plymouth they had been sent by merchant thomas weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near plymouth the men chose a site on the shore of the fore river in presentday weymouth massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth they called their colony wessagusset the settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness by march  massasoit had learned that a group of influential massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the wessagusset and plymouth colonies massasoit warned the pilgrims to strike first one of the colonists of wessagusset named phineas pratt verified that his settlement was in danger pratt managed to escape to plymouth and reported that the english in wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the massachusetts that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation bradford called a public meeting at which the pilgrims decided to send standish and a small group of eight including hobbamock to wessagusset to kill the leaders of the alleged plot to wipe out the english settlements the mission had a personal aspect for standish one of the warriors threatening wessagusset was wituwamat a neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened standish arriving at wessagusset standish found that many of the englishmen had gone to live with the massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to wessagusset pecksuot was a massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening wessagusset he came to the settlement with wituwamat and other warriors the day after standishs arrival standish claimed simply to be in wessagusset on a trading mission but pecksuot said to hobbamock let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares later in the day pecksuot approached standish looking down on him and said you are a great captain yet you are but a little man though i be no sachem yet i am of great strength and courage the next day standish arranged to meet with pecksuot over a meal in one of wessagussets oneroom houses pecksuot brought with him a third warrior named wituwamat wituwamats adolescent brother and several women standish had three men of plymouth and hobbamock with him in the house on an arranged signal the english shut the door of the house and standish attacked pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with the mans own knife wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed leaving the house standish ordered two more massachusett warriors to be put to death gathering his men standish went outside the walls of wessagusset in search of obtakiest a sachem of the massachusett tribe the englishmen soon encountered obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued during which obtakiest escaped having accomplished his mission standish returned to plymouth with wituwamats head the leaders of the alleged plot to destroy the english settlements had been killed and the threat removed but the action had unexpected consequences the settlement of wessagusset was all but abandoned after the incident which standish had been trying to protect most of the settlers departed for an english fishing post on monhegan island the attack also caused widespread panic among native americans throughout the region villages were abandoned and the pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time pastor john robinson was still in leiden but he criticized standish for his brutality bradford too was uncomfortable with his methods but he defended him in a letter as for capten standish we leave him to answer for him selfe but this we must say he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have and as carefull of the generall good dispersal of merrymount settlersedit from a thcentury dutch manual on the use of the arquebus a type of matchlock used by the pilgrims in  another group of english settlers established an outpost not far from the site of wessagusset located in what is now quincy massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth the settlement was officially known as mount wollaston but soon earned the nickname merrymount their leader thomas morton encouraged behavior that the pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous the men of merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe the sabbath and sold weapons to native americans bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered standish to lead an expedition to arrest morton in  standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building morton eventually decided to attack the men from plymouth but the merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons morton aimed a weapon at standish which the captain purportedly ripped from his hands standish and his men took morton to plymouth and eventually sent him back to england later morton wrote the book new english canaan in which he referred to myles standish as captain shrimp and wrote i have found the massachusetts indians more full of humanity than the christians penobscot expeditionedit standishs last significant expedition was against the french having defended plymouth from native americans and englishmen the french established a trading post in  on the penobscot river in what is now castine maine english forces captured the settlement in  and turned it over to plymouth colony it was a valuable source of furs and timber for the pilgrims for seven years however in  the french mounted a small expedition and easily reclaimed the settlement william bradford ordered captain standish to take action determined that the post be reclaimed in plymouth colonys name this was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which standish had previously led and to accomplish the task he chartered the ship good hope captained by a man named girling standishs plan appears to have been to bring the good hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the french into surrender unfortunately girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board standish gave up the effort by this time the neighboring and more populous massachusetts bay colony had been established bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in boston for help in reclaiming the trading post but the bay colony refused the incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies in  the two colonies merged to become the royal province of massachusetts bay settlement in duxburyedit the alexander standish house still standing built by myles standishs son on the captains farm in duxbury massachusetts in  plymouth colony leaders appointed standish to travel to london to negotiate new terms with the merchant adventurers if a settlement could be reached and the pilgrims could pay off their debt to the adventurers then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to plymouth in april  another effort was successful later in  this time negotiated by isaac allerton and several leading men of plymouth including standish paid off the colonys debt to the adventurers the leaders of plymouth colony were now free of the directives of the merchant adventurers and they exerted their newfound autonomy by organizing a land division in  large farm lots were parceled out to each family in the colony along the shore of the presentday towns of plymouth kingston duxbury and marshfield massachusetts standish received a farm of  acres  ha in what became duxbury he built a house and settled there around  there are indications that standish began to seek a quieter life by  after the penobscot expedition maintaining the livestock and fields of his duxbury farm he was about  years old at that time and he began to relinquish the responsibility of defending the colony to a younger generation a note in the colony records of  indicates that lieutenant william holmes was appointed to train the militia as standishs immediate subordinate when the pequot war loomed in  standish was appointed to a committee to raise a company of  men but it was holmes who led the company in the field the families living in duxbury sometimes duxborough asked to be set off from plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister this request was granted in  historian justin winsor and others have insisted that the name of duxbury was given by standish in honor of duxbury hall near chorley in lancashire which was owned by a branch of the standish family the coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it though no records exist to indicate how the town was named last yearsedit standish grave site in the myles standish cemetery in duxbury during the s standish took on an increasingly administrative role he served as a surveyor of highways as treasurer of the colony from  to  and on various committees to lay out boundaries of new towns and inspect waterways his old friend hobbamock had been part of his household but he died in  and was buried on standishs farm in duxbury standish died on october   of strangullion or strangury a condition often associated with kidney stones or bladder cancer he was buried in duxburys old burying ground now known as the myles standish cemetery  marriages and familyedit myles standish married rose handley – by about  she died on january   she was buried in an unmarked grave at coles hill burial ground in plymouth as were many others who died the first winter she is named on the pilgrim memorial tomb on coles hill as rose first wife of myles standish barbara mullins  by about  per banks she had come to plymouth in  on either the anne or little james and they were married the following spring historians have suggested that she may have been a

after september   charles  was born by about  he was still living on march   no further record legacyedit myles standish monument in duxbury massachusetts standishs truelife role in defending plymouth colony and the sometimes brutal tactics that he employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by henry wadsworth longfellow in his narrative poem the courtship of miles standish historian tudor jenks wrote that longfellows book had no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old plymouth however the book elevated standish to the level of folk hero in victorian america in late th century duxbury the book generated a movement to build monuments in standishs honor a beneficial byproduct of which was increased tourism to the town the first of these monuments was the largest the cornerstone was laid for the myles standish monument in duxbury in  with a crowd of ten thousand people attending the ceremonies it was finished in  the third tallest monument to an individual in the united states it is surpassed only by the first dedicated washington monument  feet in baltimore maryland finished in  and the washington monument  feet in washington dc dedicated in  the top of the monument is  feet  m overall and at the top stands a foot  m statue of standish a second smaller monument was placed over the alleged site of myles standishs grave in  two exhumations of standishs remains were undertaken in  and  to determine the location of the captains resting place a third exhumation took place in  to place standishs remains in a hermetically sealed chamber beneath the gravesite monument his burial site is located in myles standish burial ground in duxbury the site of myles standishs house reveals only a slight depression in the ground where the cellar hole was but it is now a small park owned and maintained by the town of duxbury standish maine is named for the captain as well as the neighborhood of standish minneapolis at least two forts were named after standish an earthen fort on plymouths saquish neck built during the american civil war and a larger cement fort built on lovells island in boston harbor in  both forts are now abandoned camp myles standish in nearby taunton was also named for standish myles standish state forest is located in the

to be a  likeness of standish although its authenticity has never been proven born c  chorley lancashire england died october   aged  duxbury massachusetts allegiance england plymouth colony rank captain commands held plymouth colony militia battleswars eighty years war netherlands wessagusset colony plymouth colony spouses rose standish barbara standish signature myles standish c  – october   was an english military officer hired by the pilgrims as military adviser for plymouth colony he accompanied them on the mayflower journey and played a leading role in the administration and defense of plymouth colony from its inception on february   the plymouth colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life standish served as an agent of plymouth colony in england as assistant governor and as treasurer of the colony he was also one of the first settlers and founders of the town of duxbury massachusetts a defining characteristic of standishs military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action which resulted in at least two attacks or small skirmishes on different groups of native americans—the nemasket raid and the conflict at wessagusset colony during these actions standish exhibited considerable courage and skill as a soldier but also demonstrated a brutality that angered native americans and disturbed more moderate members of the colony one of standishs last military actions on behalf of plymouth colony was the botched penobscot expedition in  by the s he relinquished his role as an active soldier and settled into a quieter life on his duxbury farm he was still nominally the commander of the pilgrim military forces in the growing colony although he seems to have preferred to act in an advisory capacity he died in his home in duxbury in  at age  he supported and defended the pilgrims colony for much of his life though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church several towns and military installations have been named for standish and monuments have been built in his memory one of the best known depictions of him in popular culture was the  poem the courtship of miles standish by henry wadsworth longfellow the highly fictionalized story presents him as a timid romantic it was extremely popular in the th century and played a significant role in

serviceedit coat of arms of myles standish little is definitively known of myles standishs origin and early life his place of birth has been subject to debate among historians for more than  years at the center of the debate is language in his will drafted in plymouth colony in  regarding his rights of inheritance standish wrote i give unto my son  heire apparent alexander standish all my lands as heire apparent by lawfull decent in ormskirke ormskirk borscouge burscough wrightington maudsley mawdesley newburrow newburgh crowston croston and in the isle of man sic to the west of croston and given to mee as right heire by lawfull decent but surruptuously detained from mee my great grandfather being a cond or younger brother from the house of standish of standish the places named by standish are all in lancashire england with the exception of the isle of man leading some to conclude that he was born in lancashire—possibly in the vicinity of chorley where a branch of the standish family owned a manor known as duxbury hall however efforts have been inconclusive in linking him to the standishes of duxbury hall a competing theory focuses on his mention of the isle of man and argues that he belonged to a manx branch of the standish family no definitive documentation exists in either location to provide clear evidence of his birthplace possibly the best source however brief on standishs origin and early life is a short passage recorded by nathaniel morton secretary of plymouth colony who wrote in his new englands memorial published in  that standish was a gentleman born in lancashire and was heir apparent unto a great estate of lands and livings surreptitiously detained from him his great grandfather being a second or younger brother from the house of standish in his younger time he went over into the low countries and was a soldier there and came acquainted with the church at leyden and came over into new england with such of them as at the first set out for the planting of the plantation of new plymouth and bare a deep share of their first difficulties and was always very faithful to their interest sir horatio vere was the commander of english troops in holland during the siege of sluis in  under whom standish likely served the circumstances are vague at best concerning standishs early military career in holland the low countries to which morton referred at the time the dutch republic was embroiled in the eighty years war with spain queen elizabeth i of england chose to support the protestant dutch republic and sent troops to fight the spanish in holland historians are divided on his role in the english military nathaniel philbrick refers to standish as a mercenary suggesting that he was a hired soldier of fortune seeking opportunity in holland but justin winsor claims that standish received a lieutenants commission in the english army and was subsequently promoted to captain in holland jeremy bangs a leading scholar of pilgrim history noted that standish likely served under sir horatio vere an english general who had recruited soldiers in both lancashire and the isle of man among other places and who led the english troops in holland at the time when standish was there whether commissioned officer mercenary or both standish apparently came to holland around  and according to historian tudor jenks may have seen service during the siege of sluis in  in which veres english troops were involved the subsequent twelve years truce – between spain and the dutch republic might have ended standishs service standish was certainly still in holland in  and living in leiden when he was hired by a group of refugee puritan dissenters from england to act as their adviser on military matters at that time he was using the title of captain when considering candidates for this important position the puritans had at first hoped to engage captain john smith one of the founders of the english colony at jamestown virginia who had also explored and mapped the north american coast they approached him to return to the new world and he expressed interest his experience made him an attractive candidate but the pilgrims ultimately decided against him his price was too high and they feared that his fame and bold character might lead him to become a dictator standish lived in leiden with his wife rose and was apparently already known to them voyage to new plymouthedit the embarkation of the pilgrims  us capitol rotunda myles and rose standish are prominently depicted in the foreground on the right on july   old style date the initial group of english dissenters living in leiden boarded the speedwell which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in england this initial group included the mostly brownist congregation myles and rose standish were aboard along with the bradfords winslows carvers and others the small ton pinnace sailed to southampton with about  passengers to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the new world another  passengers would board the ton mayflower the speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays but both vessels departed southampton august  the leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking which had caused them to return to port twice the standishes and most of the speedwell passengers crowded into the mayflower and the speedwell went on to london to be resold now with only a few passengers she subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners but never sailed to the new world the mayflower passengers meanwhile sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees and finally departed plymouth england on september   bound for the northern part of the virginia colony the passage of the mayflower across the north atlantic lasted more than two months with  passengers crowded onto the cargo ships gun deck and about  crew members the seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but by the second month the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage there were two deaths but this was just a precursor to what happened after their cape cod arrival when almost half the company died in the first winter the mayflower compact a painting by jean leon gerome ferris on november   lookouts spotted land but it was quickly appreciated that their location was about  miles eastnortheast of their planned destination of northern virginia near what is now called cape cod they tried briefly to sail south but strong seas forced them to retreat to cape cod to harbor near the hook of presentday provincetown harbor it became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south so they decided to settle near cape cod shortage of supplies including wood and beer and the roaring atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a virginia landing they anchored at the hook on november  but not before signing a significant document the leaders of the colony wrote the mayflower compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle myles standish was one of the  men who signed the document establishment of plymouth colonyedit when the mayflower was anchored off cape cod standish urged the colonys leaders to allow him to take a party ashore to find a suitable place for settlement on november   he led  men in a foot exploration of the northern portion of the cape on december  a group of  settlers including standish made an extended exploration of the shore of cape cod by boat spending their nights ashore surrounded by makeshift barricades of tree branches the settlers were attacked one night by a group of about  native americans at first the englishmen panicked but standish calmed them urging the settlers not to fire their matchlock muskets unnecessarily the incident took place in presentday eastham massachusetts and came to be known as the first encounter after further exploration the pilgrims chose a location in presentday plymouth bay in late december  as the site for their settlement standish provided important counsel on the placement of a small fort in which cannon were mounted and on the layout of the first houses for maximum defensibility only one house consisting of a single room had been built when illness struck the settlers of the roughly  who first arrived only  survived the first winter standishs wife rose died in january standish was one of the very few who did not fall ill and william bradford soon to be governor of plymouth colony credited him with comforting many and being a source of strength to those who suffered standish tended to bradford during his illness and this was the beginning of a decadeslong friendship bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and by necessity worked closely with standish the two men were opposites in terms of character bradford was patient and slow to judgment while standish was well known for his fiery temper despite their differences the two worked well together in managing the colony and responding to dangers as they arose defense of plymouth colonyedit by february  the colonists had sighted native americans several times but there had been no communication the men of the colony were anxious to prepare themselves in case of hostilities so they formed a militia on february   consisting of all ablebodied men electing standish as their commander the leaders of plymouth colony had already hired him for that role but this vote ratified the decision by democratic process the men of plymouth colony continued to reelect him to that position for the remainder of his life as captain of the militia standish regularly drilled his men in the use of pikes and muskets contact with the native americans came in march  through samoset an englishspeaking abenaki who arranged for the pilgrims to meet with massasoit the sachem of the nearby pokanoket tribe on march  the first governor of plymouth colony john carver signed a treaty with massasoit declaring an alliance between the pokanoket and the englishmen and requiring the two parties to defend each other in times of need governor carver died the same year and the responsibility of upholding the treaty fell to his successor william bradford bradford and standish were frequently preoccupied with the complex task of reacting to threats against both the pilgrims and the pokanokets from tribes such as the massachusetts and the narragansetts as threats arose standish typically advocated intimidation to deter their rivals such behavior at times made bradford uncomfortable but he found it an expedient means of maintaining the treaty with the pokanokets nemasket raidedit an  lithograph depicting the expedition against nemasket led by standish and guided by hobbamock the first challenge to the treaty came in august  when a sachem named corbitant began to undermine massasoits leadership corbitant worked to turn the people of nemasket against massasoit in the pokanoket village of nemasket now the site of middleborough massachusetts about  miles  km west of plymouth bradford sent two trusted interpreters to determine what was happening in nemasket tisquantum known to the english as squanto and hobbamock tisquantum had been pivotal in providing counsel and aid to the pilgrims ensuring the survival of the colony hobbamock another influential ally was a pniese—a highranking advisor to massasoit—and a warrior who commanded particular respect and fear among native americans when tisquantum and hobbamock arrived in nemasket corbitant took tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him hobbamock escaped to warn plymouth bradford and standish agreed that this represented a dangerous threat to the englishpokanoket alliance and decided to act quickly on august   standish led a group of  men to nemasket determined to kill corbitant they were guided by hobbamock who quickly befriended standish and the two men were close for the remainder of their lives in his old age hobbamock became part of standishs household in duxbury reaching nemasket standish planned a night attack on the wigwam in which corbitant was believed to be sleeping that night he and hobbamock burst into the shelter shouting for corbitant as frightened pokanokets attempted to escape englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets wounding a pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to plymouth to be treated standish soon learned that corbitant had already fled the village and tisquantum was unharmed standish had failed to capture corbitant but the raid had the desired effect on september   nine sachems came to plymouth including corbitant to sign a treaty of loyalty to king james palisadeedit plimoth plantation a replica reconstruction of the original pilgrim village in plymouth massachusetts including the palisade surrounding the settlement in november  a narragansett messenger arrived in plymouth and delivered a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin the pilgrims were told by tisquantum and hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from narragansett sachem canonicus the narragansetts lived west of narragansett bay in presentday rhode island and were one of the more powerful tribes in the region bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder and shot in an effort to show that they were not intimidated taking the threat seriously standish urged that the colonists encircle their small village with a palisade made of tall upright logs the proposal would require a wall more than half a mile or  km long in addition standish recommended the construction of strong gates and platforms for shooting over the wall the colony had recently been reinforced by the arrival of new colonists from the ship fortune but there were still only  men to work on the task despite the challenges the settlers constructed the palisade per standishs recommendations in just three months finishing in march  standish divided the militia into four companies one to man each wall and drilled them in defending the village in the event of attack wessagussetedit a more serious threat came from the massachusett tribe to the north and was precipitated by the arrival of a new group of english colonists in april  the vanguard of a new colony arrived in plymouth they had been sent by merchant thomas weston to establish a new settlement somewhere near plymouth the men chose a site on the shore of the fore river in presentday weymouth massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth they called their colony wessagusset the settlers of the poorly managed colony infuriated the massachusett tribe through theft and recklessness by march  massasoit had learned that a group of influential massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the wessagusset and plymouth colonies massasoit warned the pilgrims to strike first one of the colonists of wessagusset named phineas pratt verified that his settlement was in danger pratt managed to escape to plymouth and reported that the english in wessagusset had been repeatedly threatened by the massachusetts that the settlement was in a state of constant watchfulness and that men were dying at their posts from starvation bradford called a public meeting at which the pilgrims decided to send standish and a small group of eight including hobbamock to wessagusset to kill the leaders of the alleged plot to wipe out the english settlements the mission had a personal aspect for standish one of the warriors threatening wessagusset was wituwamat a neponset who had earlier insulted and threatened standish arriving at wessagusset standish found that many of the englishmen had gone to live with the massachusetts and he ordered them to be called back to wessagusset pecksuot was a massachusett warrior and leader of the group threatening wessagusset he came to the settlement with wituwamat and other warriors the day after standishs arrival standish claimed simply to be in wessagusset on a trading mission but pecksuot said to hobbamock let him begin when he dare he shall not take us unawares later in the day pecksuot approached standish looking down on him and said you are a great captain yet you are but a little man though i be no sachem yet i am of great strength and courage the next day standish arranged to meet with pecksuot over a meal in one of wessagussets oneroom houses pecksuot brought with him a third warrior named wituwamat wituwamats adolescent brother and several women standish had three men of plymouth and hobbamock with him in the house on an arranged signal the english shut the door of the house and standish attacked pecksuot stabbing him repeatedly with the mans own knife wituwamat and the third warrior were also killed leaving the house standish ordered two more massachusett warriors to be put to death gathering his men standish went outside the walls of wessagusset in search of obtakiest a sachem of the massachusett tribe the englishmen soon encountered obtakiest with a group of warriors and a skirmish ensued during which obtakiest escaped having accomplished his mission standish returned to plymouth with wituwamats head the leaders of the alleged plot to destroy the english settlements had been killed and the threat removed but the action had unexpected consequences the settlement of wessagusset was all but abandoned after the incident which standish had been trying to protect most of the settlers departed for an english fishing post on monhegan island the attack also caused widespread panic among native americans throughout the region villages were abandoned and the pilgrims had difficulty reviving trade for some time pastor john robinson was still in leiden but he criticized standish for his brutality bradford too was uncomfortable with his methods but he defended him in a letter as for capten standish we leave him to answer for him selfe but this we must say he is as helpfull an instrument as any we have and as carefull of the generall good dispersal of merrymount settlersedit from a thcentury dutch manual on the use of the arquebus a type of matchlock used by the pilgrims in  another group of english settlers established an outpost not far from the site of wessagusset located in what is now quincy massachusetts about  miles  km north of plymouth the settlement was officially known as mount wollaston but soon earned the nickname merrymount their leader thomas morton encouraged behavior that the pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous the men of merrymount built a maypole drank liberally refused to observe the sabbath and sold weapons to native americans bradford found the weapons sales particularly disturbing and ordered standish to lead an expedition to arrest morton in  standish arrived with a group of men to find that the small band at merrymount had barricaded themselves within a small building morton eventually decided to attack the men from plymouth but the merrymount group were too drunk to handle their weapons morton aimed a weapon at standish which the captain purportedly ripped from his hands standish and his men took morton to plymouth and eventually sent him back to england later morton wrote the book new english canaan in which he referred to myles standish as captain shrimp and wrote i have found the massachusetts indians more full of humanity than the christians penobscot expeditionedit standishs last significant expedition was against the french having defended plymouth from native americans and englishmen the french established a trading post in  on the penobscot river in what is now castine maine english forces captured the settlement in  and turned it over to plymouth colony it was a valuable source of furs and timber for the pilgrims for seven years however in  the french mounted a small expedition and easily reclaimed the settlement william bradford ordered captain standish to take action determined that the post be reclaimed in plymouth colonys name this was a significantly larger proposition than the small expeditions which standish had previously led and to accomplish the task he chartered the ship good hope captained by a man named girling standishs plan appears to have been to bring the good hope within cannon range of the trading post and to bombard the french into surrender unfortunately girling ordered the bombardment before the ship was within range and quickly spent all the gunpowder on board standish gave up the effort by this time the neighboring and more populous massachusetts bay colony had been established bradford appealed to leaders of the colony in boston for help in reclaiming the trading post but the bay colony refused the incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies in  the two colonies merged to become the royal province of massachusetts bay settlement in duxburyedit the alexander standish house still standing built by myles standishs son on the captains farm in duxbury massachusetts in  plymouth colony leaders appointed standish to travel to london to negotiate new terms with the merchant adventurers if a settlement could be reached and the pilgrims could pay off their debt to the adventurers then the colonists would have new rights to allot land and settle where they pleased standish was not successful in his negotiations and returned to plymouth in april  another effort was successful later in  this time negotiated by isaac allerton and several leading men of plymouth including standish paid off the colonys debt to the adventurers the leaders of plymouth colony were now free of the directives of the

duxborough asked to be set off from plymouth as a separate town with their own church and minister this request was granted in  historian justin winsor and others have insisted that the name of duxbury was given by standish in honor of duxbury hall near chorley in lancashire which was owned by a branch of the standish family the coincidence would suggest that he had something to do with it

colony and the sometimes brutal tactics that he employed were largely obscured by the fictionalized character created by henry wadsworth longfellow in his narrative poem the courtship of miles standish historian tudor jenks wrote that longfellows book had no claim to be considered other than a pleasant little fairystory and as an entirely misleading sketch of men and matters in old plymouth however the book elevated standish to the level of folk hero in victorian america in late th century duxbury the book generated a movement to build monuments in standishs honor a beneficial byproduct of which was increased tourism to the town the first of these monuments was the largest the cornerstone was laid for the myles standish monument in duxbury in  with a crowd of ten thousand people
