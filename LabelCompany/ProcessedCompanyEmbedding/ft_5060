answers can this be used as a sump pump discharge hose in the winter time can this be used as a sump pump discharge hose in the winter time asked by noodle hello there are considerations that have to be taken into account the thermostat for the kamph thermohose is in the cord if you plug this cord in inside the home the thermostat will never turn on since it will be at room temperature if you do plug the hose in outside to where the thermostat will turn on you will have to connect it to somethingand the connections would not be heated so they will freeze if you are able to address these two considerations it should work just fine answered by kh customer service date published  is this hose ok to use for drinking water for camper hook up asked by jason the thermohose is no approved for potable water and is not recommended for use as an rv water source using the thermohose as a water source for an rv can damage the rv water connections as these connections are not heated and can freeze when water is not moving through the hose answered by kh customer service date published  y m d hcst bvseobulk prodbvqa vnbulkhotfix cp bvpage cohasquestionsanswers tq loc sid prod

change on the missouri river floodplain bioscience   comparative inventories in  and  and in  of vegetation from  forest stands downstream of garrison dam on the missouri river in central north dakota showed a a sharp decline in cottonwood regeneration b a strong compositional shift toward dominance by green ash and c large increases in invasive understory species such as smooth brome reed canary grass and canada thistle these changes and others discovered during remeasurement have been caused by a complex of factors some related to damming altered hydrologic and sediment regimes delta formation and associated wet—dry cycles and some not diseases and expansion of invasive plants dominance of green ash however may be short lived given the likelihood that the emerald ash borer will arrive in the dakotas in – years with potentially devastating effects the prospects for recovery of this valuable ecosystem rich in ecosystem goods and services and in american history are daunting
