first steps in answering the questions above and driving toward the creation of the ultimate place to buy and sell online following searched items ryno makes it easy to follow any item you are eager

youre buying something from a good friend you trust that when you hand over payment that they will give you the item for sale ryno uses this as way for individuals to mark people they trust as trusted the more positive interactions you have will likely result in this score going up you know bob right youve know him for a long time and if some approached you saying they were going to buy something from bob would you say you trust him now this doesnt mean the item hes selling is perfect the trust in this case just means that you personally know bob and trust hes a good person and not someone trying to pull a fast one on someone if someone you knew was selling something would you steer clear not say anything as you arent sure or do you know this person well enough to say you trust this person and feel hes just trying to do an honest deal trust score if you see a member with a trust   this only means that there are  other members of ryno that know and have marked that they trust this member each trust score is clickable where you can see each individual that makes up that number this way if you see someone you know youll have a better connection in knowing youre dealing with
