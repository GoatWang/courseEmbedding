of gran tierra commented  is off to an exciting start for gran tierra we are pleased to report that the acordionero field in the middle magdalena basin continues to exceed our expectations and are encouraged by the discovery of a new and deeper  degree api gravity oil reservoir in the field which we plan to effectively exploit using our existing infrastructure we continue to see encouraging results with the a limestone play in the costayaco field in the putumayo basin with a recent third recompletion in the field in the cyc well producing at an initial rate of  barrel of oil per day bopd in the putumayo block put the confianza explorationappraisal well has encountered potential oil pay in three reservoirs two of which would be new zones for this block we believe that our focused strategy is delivering results on several fronts in colombia with our positive results from development drilling in acordionero our exciting new a limestone play at costayaco and our high potential

injector in the lisama a and c reservoirs as a pilot test for enhanced oil recovery the well was drilled in the lowest structural position to date in the field and crossed the oilwater contact owc in the lisama a at a depth  feet deeper than the previous lowest known oil depth lko petrophysical analysis of the acis well logs indicates that the lisama c reservoirs p owc was likely found at approximately the expected depth the aci was drilled below the lisama c in order to appraise the lower part of the lisama interval and an oilbearing lisama d sand was found a total of  ft of gross pay was perforated in the lisama d sand for testing over a three day period the well flowed naturally and produced  degree api oil at an average rate of  bopd and  water cut from only  feet of perforated pay the test results for the lisama d sand at aci are positive since they indicate the existence of a previously untested reservoir at the deepest position in the reservoir that has been drilled to date the aci will be completed initially as a lisama c injector the initial waterflood pilot for acordionero is forecasted to be onstream in early second quarter the ac development well was spud on february   and reached  ft md and  ft tvd on february   and completion operations began on the same day the lisama a sand was cored and  ft of core was recovered total cost to drill core complete and tiein this well is forecasted to be  million which the lowest cost to date in acordionero based on logging while drilling lwd data the following potential net pays were identified lisama a  ft lisama c  ft and lisama d  ft the completion plan for ac is to start with the lowest productive interval and conduct a short term test of the lisama d before completing the lisama c and equipping with an electric submersible pump espbased on petrophysical analysis of logs the lisamad is also present in the ac well with  ft of net pay and in the ac well with  ft of net pay both of these wells were drilled by the previous operator however they were not testedthe next well ac is designed to target reserves in the lisama a and c reservoirs this will be the first well in the next phase of the

was producing  bopd at a  water cut approximately  barrels of water per day from the caballos and t sands potential pay was identified in the a limestone and m limestone and a packer was set to temporarily isolate the active caballos and t sands a ft interval was perforated in the lower a limestone with no initial pressure or fluid flow response the lower a limestone interval was stimulated with acid and a pump run to clean up the well the well cleaned up and tested  bopd of  degree api oil along with a low water cut of  over a  hour time period on february   over the past  hours the production from the well has averaged  bopd with a water cut of  cyc is now the third well producing from the a limestone formation in the costayaco field production from the lower a limestone interval will continue to be evaluated before making a decision to move uphole to perforate and stimulate an additional  feet of pay in the upper a limestone and  feet of pay in the m limestone intervalscyc was spud on december   and will be the first horizontal well into the a limestone a pilot hole was successfully drilled into the a limestone formation where  feet of core was recovered the core showed extensive fracturing and strong oil shows including visible oil not only from the fractures but also the matrix structure of the rock extensive core analysis is currently underway to better understand the a limestone throughout the costayaco field and the putumayo basin while oil shows were found throughout the cored interval a specific ft interval has been identified as having the best fracture density and will be the targeted zone for the meter horizontal leg the well has been kicked off and was landed  feet below the top of the targeted ft zone within the a limestone as planned casing is currently being set and drilling will continue within the next couple of daysthe two recompleted a limestone wells cyc and cyc continue to perform well and have produced an average

a key focus throughout the second half of  where injection volumes were increased by  several plans are in place to continue to increase injection volumes through  by converting wells to injectors stimulating existing injectors and adding pump capacity injection volumes should increase by another  through the year to provide pressure support and optimize recoveriesmoqueta field development gran tierra  wi and operatorwith the previously reported increase in water injection into moqueta the overall gor in this field has started to decrease and production has started to increase in a number of wells in particular mqt production has increased by about  bopd since september of  and is currently producing record high volumes for that well of around  bopd we anticipate the trend to continue and therefore we are not forecasting any oil production decline at moqueta in  with little capital requirementson february   a total of  ft of pay was perforated across the a and m limestones in the mqt wellbore the final completion string was run in the hole to allow for selective stimulations and testing of each zone an  gallonft concentration of hydrochloric acid was used to stimulate both zones and although injectivity plots demonstrated that the acid was effective the stimulation volumes may not have been large enough to effectively access the fractures within the reservoir a higher volume

particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of  mcf  barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of  mcf  barrel would be misleading as an indication of valuereferences to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of longterm performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or welltest interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
