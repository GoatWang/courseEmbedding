relationship with foreside will allow bam to focus its expertise on growing its differentiated mutual funds and burnhams other offerings including separate account strategies and alternative investments bams assets under management grew materially in  due in part to an increase in net subscriptions into its financial sector mutual funds  for more information about burnham funds please

funds including a free prospectus and performance current to the most recent monthend please call at fund or visit the website at wwwburnhamfundscom the prospectus contains important information about the funds including investment objectives risks management fees sales charges and other expenses which you should consider carefully please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money owning mutual fund shares involves investment risk including possible loss of principal there are special risks associated with sector funds which primarily limit their investments to companies in specific industries these types of fund may be susceptible to factors affecting these industries and each funds value may fluctuate more than a fund that invests in a wider range of industries because this fund concentrates its investments in one sector of the economy financial services fund and it invests in derivative securities financial longshort fund investors should consider these risks because they may experience greater volatility than in a fund that invests across several sectors in particular companies within the financial services sector have recently been subject to unprecedented stock price volatility and depreciation and there is significant uncertainty regarding the viability and prospects of many financial services companies investments in derivatives could magnify any of the funds gains or losses derivatives involve a number of risks including possible default by the other party to the transaction illiquidity and to the extent the managers view of certain market security or interest rate movements is incorrect the risk that the use of derivatives could result in losses greater than if they had not been used the burnham investors trust funds are
