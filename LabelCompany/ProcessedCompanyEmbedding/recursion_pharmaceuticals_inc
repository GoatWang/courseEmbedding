unique platform is what sets us apart poised at the crossroads of biology and computation the recursion approach leverages the most advanced highthroughput biology and artificial intelligence to rapidly discover treatments for thousands of diseases  all for the price of one​  ​rich data from images​our technology takes advantage of advanced imaging to provide rich datasets quickly and cheaply just as patients with certain genetic diseases may have a specific phenotype cells modeling genetic disease often display specific structural signatures for many diseases these phenotypes are accessible via cellular images​ ​proprietary cellular “fingerprints”​​we use the latest biological tools to build hundreds of unique cellular disease models we image tens of thousands of cells per model and extract nearly  structural features from every cell using these features we develop proprietary cellular “fingerprints” branded phenoprint of cells in health and disease with phenoprint in hand we can ask whether any drug rescues diseased cells back to health ​ ​finding new treatments​our proprietary interactive data visualization software enables our biologists to query and understand the results of phenotypic screens drug screens and target discovery screens with immediate access to raw images and underlying data indepth analysis enables interrogation of complex biological interactions for drug repurposing new chemical entity discovery and target discovery​ partnership on validated discoveries​with broad biological expertise in house our insights are always validated
