hour solarplusstorage system enables offgrid building to reduce reliance on diesel fuel through costeffective renewable power austin texas june   globe newswire  ideal power inc nasdaqipwr an inventive power conversion technology company today announced its products will serve in a collaborative hybrid microgrid project that will provide power to a commercial facility on the island of saint croix in the us virgin islands like many buildings in the caribbean this facility is completely disconnected from the central power grid and has relied exclusively on diesel generators for power  hours a day with the deployment of ideal power’s six stabiliti™ c multiport power conversion systems that integrate solar photovoltaic and batteries with the existing diesel generators the facility will be able to reduce fuel and energy costs and cut greenhouse gas emissions by harnessing the power of the sun to power the facility the cost of electricity on the caribbean islands averages about  cents per kilowatthour kwh – about three to five times that of the mainland united states decades of persistently high electricity prices coupled with poor power quality and frequent grid outages have contributed to the region’s high cost of business and undercut growth in many caribbean economies renewable energy technologies hold much promise for the region by bringing a diversification of energy sources and substantial cost reductions “our technology is enabling the deployment of clean costeffective and efficient power generation in areas where there is no reliable grid available” said dan brdar ceo of ideal power “thanks to our multiport technology our six power conversion units will run in parallel to integrate solar storage and diesel into a hybrid microgrid that will support cost effective power generation around the clock” in an effort to transition to costeffective sustainable power solutions the saint croixbased commercial facility has called upon innovative energy partners to lead a nextgeneration solarplusstorage project that encompasses six  kilowatt kw photovoltaic solar arrays three  kw diesel generators and a  kwh battery the integration of the solar and diesel power systems is made possible through six stabiliti units a compact solution that efficiently enables bidirectional power flow between solar storage and diesel all in one box the hybrid microgrid is part of the facility’s environmentally progressive design boasting high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning  led lighting and now solar power generation “this project represents a very smart move by an offgrid business” said john merritt ‎director of applications engineering at ideal power “shifting to clean energy will offset costs and enable the business to focus on providing the best experience for its customers we are optimistic that more island businesses and residences will see the potential of renewable energy systems to boost energy conservation and save on costs” about
