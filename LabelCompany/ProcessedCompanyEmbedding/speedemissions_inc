automotive services speedemissions inc expands to provide basic automotive services company recognizes growing opportunity in automotive aftermarket services speedemissions inc may    tweet share speedemissions inc a vehicle emissions testing and safety inspections company with stores in atlanta ga houston texas st louis mo and salt lake city utah announced a major change in the direction of its business model to the speedemissions car care stores this new concept will allow the company using its emission customer base as the foundation to provide not just emission repair services but an array of basic automotive services and products to its customers and to more rapidly expand its store presence throughout the  states where decentralized vehicle emission testing is mandated by the us environmental protection agency over the past  years speedemissions has helped pioneer the test only model for emission testing andor safety inspections during this time speedemissions primary focus was to perform the vehicle inspection and not upsell customers on other automotive products and services however after reviewing emission industry and automotive aftermarket forecasts over the last several months the company now believes that remaking itself into more of a complete auto service provider will enable it to grow its business and potentially move into new markets and accelerate franchise sales we have been studying this modification of our business model for some time commented rich parlontieri president and ceo of speedemissions in an industry where the american consumer is now holding a car for  years and where nearly  percent of light automotive vehicles are outside the manufacturers warranty we believe offering a number of different automotive services to our customers is a logical move for us to make now and for the long term we believe this transition to emission repair tuneup brake repair airconditioning diagnostics and other automotive services and products will hopefully result in a higher per customer ticket average thereby increasing both revenue and income in addition we expect the decision to remodel four to six of our current stores and build new stores will enhance the growth of the speedemissions car care franchise unit   emissions related home speedemissions inc emissions savvy fleets are cashing in on failed dpfs and docs
