earns an a so why doesn’t everyone support it contributors — h m ago view all   why we need precision medicine—now by jessica m bibliowicz    pm edt  nbsp  thinkstock the launch of president obama’s precision medicine initiative is putting a cuttingedge approach to research and patient care on the map  academic medical centers have been pioneering the development of precision medicine for more than a decade—and now it’s time for the biopharmaceutical industry to get deeper in the gamethe goal of precision medicine is simple to offer individual patients exactly the right medical care at the right time by taking their genes lifestyle and environment into account  however making that vision a reality will require a significant investment of brainpower technology and capitaladvertisementthe federal government thinks it can be done  the president’s precision medicine initiative was created to the tune of  million in fiscal year —a timely vote of confidence that comes on the heels of twelve years of declining government funding for medical research  soon a million or more volunteers will be recruited to join a massive national cohort and share their genetic and health data with researchers at academic medical centers and community health organizations  information gleaned from this unprecedented study has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat conditions ranging from diabetes to schizophreniaat weill cornell medicine where i serve as chairman of the board initial efforts have focused on people with cancer  patients with advanced disease who have often run out of other options come in for dna sequencing at the englander institute for precision medicine  this extra layer of information has prompted doctors to try drugs and combinations that might not have been considered before an individual with bladder cancer receives a breast cancer drug because of her genetic makeup for example  increasingly patients are able to beat the odds and live longer fuller lives but there are still hurdles to be overcome institute director dr mark rubin and dr himisha beltran who leads clinical activities studied a group of  patients and found that more than ninety percent had genetic mutations that could potentially be treated with existing or experimental drugs  however only five percent could actually access the medications that were recommended  the others were unable to enroll in the appropriate clinical trial or to use approved drugs in offlabel waysthat’s where the biopharmaceutical industry can really step in  “universities excel at identifying biological targets for new drugs and at pinpointing the patients who are more likely to respond to specific treatments  industry excels at making drugs and can partner with academia to help implement largescale clinical trials to test them” explained dr beltran  “to get more patients to benefit from precision medicine we need to work together so that promising drugs end up in the right hands and clinical trials are enrolling the right subsets of people”universities and drug companies have a long history of collaborating to develop medicines that have saved and improved the lives of countless individuals  according to dr francis collins head of the national institutes of health—the country’s biggest source of funding for medical research—these alliances are key to introducing new therapies
