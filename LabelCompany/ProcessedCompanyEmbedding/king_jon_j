used from   new from  and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord ephesians a puritan bible primer is a guide for parents to train young children to receive instruction in gods truth this primer includes the disciples prayer books of the bible a primer catechism a general confession of faith poems and selected hymns and psalmsthe disciples prayer also known as the lords prayer is a blessed model for our children to learn how to pray as well as a model for parents to instruct the children in the various facets and graces of prayer in by and through our crucified risen and ascended lordknowing the books in the bible is an essential primer for the young children as well as the young in christ because knowing where to turn in the bible when the preacher mentions a passage of scripture is so very importanta primer catechism is a simpler form of questions and answers than those found in a puritan family devotional or a pilgrim family devotional nevertheless the blessed truths gleaned from this catechism will plant many seeds of biblical truth in the heart of the child as well as prepare the child to join the family in catechism recitation be it mr spurgeons a puritan catechism the westminster shorter catechism or the heidelberg catechismthe generic general confession of faith contained in this little volume allow for the use of this resource by families regardless of the denomination of their reformed and evangelical faith baptist presbyterian congregational reformed lutheran etcpoems paraphrasing the scripture or placing doctrinal experiential or practical truths in meter or rhyme will bring joy to your children as they learn the scriptures and its truth in metrical formthe seven selected hymns and seven selected psalms from the scottish psalter are the very same found in a puritan family devotional and a pilgrim family devotional the primer truly serves as a basic and fundamental resource

in a cold and remote land it would be by his grace alone according to his good pleasure man cannot manufacture revival nor can he manipulate god in any way to bring revival to pass nevertheless our savior and sovereign has ordained means by which he accomplishes his will presenting his ways according to his word that being so ministers of god were responsible by gods grace to employ those means to the fullest extent possible and permissible in order to exalt christ and bestow upon god the greatest glory redeemed souls could offertherefore in scammon bay i began piecing together what would soon become a puritan family devotional for those who were already in the congregation kept by gods grace in his word and on his way it was necessary to encourage daily bible readings in the home expositional and expository preaching and teaching is wonderful but if it causes the congregation to be lulled into finding satisfaction in the study and meditation of gods word only once or twice per week when it is preached from the pulpit we have failed as pastors the weekly exhortation from the pulpit alone will never afford the congregation the opportunities necessary to grow in grace and be strengthened in faith therefore daily bread the bible reading plan of robert murray mcheyne was made available to the congregationas god was saving souls by his grace it was necessary for us to ensure that those christ was saving knew what it was that we believed with regard to gods word editing charles spurgeons a puritan catechism in plain language for our beloved yupik people was the next stepyet as every believer matures at differing rates and that by gods grace it was necessary to identify those whom god had raised or those who he was raising within that local congregation these leaders should certainly have knowledge of orthodox christianity that surpasses a mere familiarity of the bible and essential salvation truth therefore the second london baptist confession of  was edited in plain language for our congregationcircumstances however caused my family and me to have to leave our beloved yupik people earlier than we had expected and we were not able to compile all that we were working on into a singular devotional volume until now now not only do we have a puritan family devotional containing the  london baptist confession but we also have a pilgrim family devotional containing the  philadelphia baptist confession the philadelphia confession is exactly like the nd london confession except that the philadelphia confession has two additions the singing of psalms in worship and the laying on of handsa pilgrim family devotional is now available using scripture translations from five english versions kjv esv nasb and nkjv these elements in the catechism bible reading plan and confession of faith combined with psalms and hymns makes this an excellent volume for use in spiritual growththe little paperback is not flashy it contains nothing groundbreaking nothing new under the sun nevertheless it contains a great deal of devotional encouragement in a size thats easy to carry along with your personal biblecheck out christ and him

raras spesh new gripton included ikon ardent race thunder burts etc these are probably the best tires you can buy in terms of speed grip longevity and flatsidewall protection the downside is that the sidewalls get chewed up after a few rides and look like hell but these tires have been bombproof for me i have used them in every condition wet dry rocky sandy hardback etc they do pretty good in all conditions i always come back to this tire when everything else fails they are not going to hook up as good as something like the rara but they hold there own and feel faster to me regardless they are definitely more robust even than the ss rara and cheaper for the price they cant be beat definitely recommend themchris lcommentpost a commentpost commentwas this helpfulflag inappropriatereview by thomas h on september  great xc tiresthese tire worked flawlessly and got me through my first leadville  ran them tubeless with psi rear and psi front had stable predictable handling good traction and great low rolling resistance most importantly no flats and leadville although not technical has some high speed very rocky sections these replaced a set of ardent race s and these seemed to have quite a bit less rolling resistance i would definitely highly recommend these for fast xc style ridingthomas hcommentpost a commentpost commentwas this helpfulflag inappropriatereview by randy w on july  bombproof performancenot so muchfamiliarity ive used it once or twice and have initial impressionsthese tires are described in part even better this also creates an enhanced level of puncture protection hence the name no way while the sidewalls seem beefier my rear tire blew one out in less than  miles i live in the desert and ride on rocky prickly trails but the only trail this tire saw was a  wide littlemorethangravel road not only did the tire puncture it split enough to spew revosealant all over the trail and cannot be salvaged im hoping i just happened to get a defective tire to cap off the bad taste in my mouth after emailing my complaint to competitive cyclist i got exactly nothing in return no response crickets not even sorry but these things happenrandy wcommentpost a

september  great all around xc tiresfamiliarity ive put it through the wringerthis is one of the best all around xc tires out there i ran mine tubeless at  psi for training and as low as  for races the protection technology makes for a super solid tubeless set up and these tires have excellent flat protection especially when compared to some ultrathin xc tires its a fastrolling tread that also holds amazing grip on rocks and in corners i have yet to run them in really wet or muddy conditions an ideal xc quiver for one season would be  sets of these and a pair of xkings for the mud henry
