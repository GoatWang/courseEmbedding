external links business overviewedit onsite generationedit the onsite generation business segment is based on water electrolysis technology which involves the decomposition of water into oxygen o and hydrogen gas h by passing an electric current through a liquid electrolyte the resultant hydrogen gas is then captured and used for industrial gas applications hydrogen fueling applications and is used to store renewable and surplus energy in the form of hydrogen gas hydrogenics hystat electrolyzer products can be used both indoors and outdoors power systemsedit the power systems business segment is based on pem fuel cell technology which transforms chemical energy resulting from the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy edgar its hypm products can handle electrical power outputs ranging from  kilowatt to  megawatt the company also develops and delivers hydrogen generation products based on pem water electrolysis power to gasedit main article power to gas powertogas is an energy process and storage technology which takes the excess power generated by wind turbines solar power or biomass power plants and converts carbon dioxide and water
