plastc important notice we regret to inform you for the past  years our mission here at plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet after making enormous leaps in development product innovation and progress towards our goal plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue plastc inc is exploring options to file chapter  bankruptcy and will cease operations on april   while we have fallen short of our goal we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working plastc card however without the necessary capital to continue all employees have been let go which means that customer care and social media channels are unmanned or have been shut down how we got here we were expecting to close a  million series a funding round on february   there are functioning plastc cards which were demonstrated to our investors and our backers and the capital was to be allocated for the mass production and shipping of plastc cards to preorder customers at first the principal investment group postponed their investment and a couple of weeks later the round fell apart after the initial funding was unavailable plastc made progress with another investor who offered  million this deal was scheduled to close last week and would propel development across the finish line as well as allow for plastc card preorders to be shipped and for production to continue into a retail phase however once again at the very last minute our investor gave us notice that they have decided rescind their investment offer the round was a signature away from closing and we were extremely caught off guard when they notified us yesterday they were backing out our existing investors kept us alive and functioning as long as they could during this fundraising process but in the end we needed new outside capital to get into production what this means for backers it’s been a long road with a lot of obstacles the support of our amazing backers has been incredible which makes this announcement even harder we were so incredibly ready for production in order to hit our deadlines but without capital it is impossible for us to move forward and we will not be able to fulfill any preorders we are disappointed and emotionally distraught and while we know this is extremely disappointing for you we want our backers to know that we did everything we could to make plastc card a reality  plastc inc img height width alt styledisplaynone srchttpswwwfacebookcomtrevampcdvalueampcdcurrencyusdampnoscript img

interested in getting parts to their customers quick  the basis for their company philosophy needs to improve they cannot hold tight tolerances on the parts they do have a limit on the overall size for their parts  at the time it was less then  in length that may have changed as i have not used them within the last year or so again they cannot get second operations or sourcing done comment

ordered from them more than once and will continue if i need oneoff or low quantity parts great for manufacturing fixtures strengths the whole process is quick and seamless the quoting process is quick and accurate costs are competitive and you get charged what the quoting system says the orders can be made online and parts ship when made needs to improve biggest weakness is that they offer no inspection services that i am aware of the tolerances are a bit generous as well so its not good for precision parts other weaknesses are that they dont have a mac version of the part visualization
