registered market maker and register to be a clp for the etp liquidity providers may be a clp in multiple listings view this page as a pdf how the program works the bats clp program attracts traders and institutions in two ways first the program encourages initial involvement by allowing multiple registered clps to participate in the launch of the etp this makes it easier for liquidity providers to participate by allowing each of them to put up a smaller amount of seed capital which may limit their individual risk this arrangement also promotes more liquidity from the beginning because multiple clps have a stake in the etp secondly the program encourages participation postipo with an incentive for clps to provide liquidity and create tighter spreads which may result in enhanced liquidity and market quality in clp securities this is done with an issuersponsored monetary reward in which clps compete against each other it is possible that upon withdrawal from the clp program a clp security may experience lower levels of liquidity and a negative price impact as compared to the period during which the security was participating in the clp program clp reward each day clps compete for a reward ranging from – the reward is split between the top two clps on the bid side and the offer side the top two clps on each side receive  and  of their sides split respectively for

also available to other vendors to create the proposed bats one feed the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed the exchanges have represented that they will continue to make these individual underlying feeds available and that as a result the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed would be the same as the source available to other vendors as described more fully below the bats one feed would be a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” of all displayed orders for securities traded on the exchanges and for which the exchanges report quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also contain the individual last sale information for each of the exchanges in addition the bats one feed would include messages from the exchanges about trading on their markets finally the bats one feed would contain an optional functionality that would enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated twosided quotations from the exchanges for up to five  price levels description of the bats one feed the bats one feed would contain the aggregate bbo of the exchanges for all securities that are traded on the exchanges and for which the exchanges report quotes under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the aggregate bbo would include the total size of all orders at the bbo available on all exchanges the bats one feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual exchanges the last sale information would include the price size time of execution and the individual exchange on which the trade was executed the last sale message would also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all exchanges for that trading day the exchanges have represented that they would disseminate the aggregate bbo of the exchanges and last sale information through the bats one feed no earlier than each individual exchange provides its bbo and last sale information to the processors under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also include symbol summary market status retail liquidity identifier on behalf of byx trading status and trade break messages the symbol summary message would include the total executed volume across all of the exchanges the market status message would be disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the exchanges for example the market status message would indicate whether one of the exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the bats one feed as part of the aggregated bbo the market status message would also indicate when an exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated bbo the retail liquidity identifier indicator message would be disseminated via the bats one feed on behalf of the byx only pursuant to byxs retail price improvement “rpi” program the retail liquidity identifier indicates when rpi interest priced at least  better than byxs protected bid or protected offer for a particular security is available in the system the exchanges propose to disseminate the retail liquidity indicator via the bats one feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams ie pursuant to the consolidated tape association planconsolidated quotation plan or ctacq for tape a and tape b securities and the nasdaq utp plan for tape c securities as well as through proprietary byx data feeds the retail liquidity identifier reflects the symbol and the side buy or sell of the rpi interest but does not include the price or size of the rpi interest in particular like cq and utp quoting outputs the bats one feed would include a field for codes related to the retail price improvement identifier the codes indicate rpi interest that is priced better than byxs protected bid or protected offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the program the trade break message would indicate when an execution on one of the exchanges has been broken in accordance with the individual exchanges rules the trading status message would indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual exchange for example a trading status message would be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to rule  of regulation sho “short sale circuit breaker” or the security is subject to a trading halt suspension or pause declared by the listing market a trading status message would be sent whenever a securitys trading status changes optional functionality for aggregate depth of book the bats one feed would also offer an additional optional functionality that would enable recipients to receive twosided quotations from the exchanges for five  price levels for all securities that are traded on the exchanges the option for start printed page receiving the bats one feed with this depth of book functionality is referred to as the “bats one premium feed” the option for receiving the bats one feed without this functionality is referred to as the “bats one summary feed” for each price level on one of the exchanges the bats one premium feed option of the bats one feed would include a twosided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level distribution of the bats one feed the exchanges represent that they have taken into consideration their affiliated relationships in the design of the bats one feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchanges both from the perspective of latency and cost the exchanges have stated that they propose to offer the bats one feed voluntarily in response to demand from vendors and subscribers that are interested in receiving the aggregate bbo and last sale information from the exchanges as part of a single data feed the exchanges assert that the bats one feed can be used by industry professionals and retail investors looking for a cost effective easytoadminister high quality market data product with the characteristics of the bats one feed the exchanges also assert that the bats one feed would help protect a free and open market by providing vendors and subscribers additional choices in receiving this type of market data thus promoting competition and innovation with respect to latency the exchanges have represented that the path for distribution by the exchanges of bats one feed would not be faster than the path for distribution that would be used by a vendor to distribute an independently created a bats onelike product accordingly the exchanges have stated the proposed bats one data feed is a data product that a competing vendor could create and sell without being in a disadvantaged position relative to the exchange in recognition that the exchanges are the source of their own market data and affiliated with one another the exchanges have represented that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is available to other vendors specifically the exchanges have represented that they would use the following data feeds to create the proposed bats one feed each of which is available to other vendors the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed the exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available these individual underlying feeds and that as a result the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors the exchanges have also made the following representations regarding the latency of the bats one feed and any consolidated feed to be offered by a competing vendor in order to create the bats one feed the system creating and supporting the bats one feed would need to receive the individual data feeds from each exchange and in turn aggregate and summarize that data to create the bats one feed and then distribute it to end users this is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the bats one feed to distribute to its end users in addition a competing vendor could locate its servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed and could therefore receive the individual data feeds from each exchange at the same time as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed thus the exchanges have stated that they would not have any unfair advantage over competing vendors with respect to obtaining data from the individual exchanges because the technology supporting the bats one feed would similarly need to obtain the underlying data feeds and because this connection would be on a level playing field with a competing vendor located at the same facility as the exchanges likewise the bats one data feed would not have a speed advantage visàvis competing vendors with respect to access to end user customers whether those end users are also located in the same data center or not with regard to cost the exchanges have represented that they will file a separate rule filing with the commission to establish fees for bats one feed and that these fees would be designed to ensure that vendors could compete with the exchanges by creating a similar product to ensure a vendor can compete with the exchanges by creating the same product as the bats one feed and selling it to their clients the exchanges have also represented that they would charge their clients for the bats one feed an amount that is no less than the cost to a market data vendor to obtain all the underlying feeds plus an amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function thus the pricing for the bats one feed would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no pricing disadvantage relative to the exchanges implementation date the exchanges have represented that they anticipate making the bats one feed available as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule changes by the commission and the effectiveness of rule filings to establish the fees for the bats one feed iii summary of comments as noted above the commission received three comment letters on previous versions of the proposed changes filed by some of the exchanges in their current proposals the exchanges have responded to the points raised by these commenters the three commenters generally oppose the proposed bats one feed the shatto letter expressed general concerns about the transparency of order flow information to regulators the themis letter expressed objections to the proposed bats one feed on the grounds that it would introduce a new proprietary data feed and expressed concerns generally about the complexity arising from the proliferation of new data technologies in their response to the commenters the exchanges argued that the themis letter and shatto letter are not responsive to the issues raised in the proposal or are aimed at existing elements of us market structure that have been previously approved by the commission the sifma letter primarily argues that the fees for the proposed bats one feed do not meet the requirements of the act including the requirement that such fees be “fair and reasonable” under section acc of the act sifma also contends that bats has circumvented the requirement to receive commission approval for this product by offering and marketing the bats one feed since august   in their response to the sifma letter the exchanges noted that the thrust of the sifma letter is aimed at the initially proposed fees which have now been removed from the proposed rule changes and are to be filed with the commission via separate rule filings start printed page the exchanges also noted that while the sifma letter correctly states that bats has marketed the bats one feed since august   the sifma letter incorrectly asserts that bats has offered the bats one feed since that same date the exchanges have represented that all of their marketing materials have included statements that the bats one feeds implementation was pending to commission approval and at no point have the exchanges offered the bats one product for any use other than for testing and certification iv discussion and commission findings after carefully considering the proposals and the comments submitted the commission finds that the proposed rule changes as modified by amendments nos  and  are consistent with the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges in particular the commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section acc of the act  and with rule a of regulation nms thereunder which requires that any national securities exchange national securities association broker or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock to a securities information processor broker dealer or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory the commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the commission notes that to create the bats one feed the exchanges would use underlying data feeds that belong to the exchanges the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed accordingly the commissions review of the exchanges proposals has focused in particular on whether the proposals would result in affiliated exchanges—which are separate selfregulatory organizations under the act—making their data products or services available to one another at terms eg content pricing or latency that are more favorable than those available to unaffiliated market participants the exchanges have represented that the bats one feed would be created using underlying data feeds that are available for subscription by vendors in recognition that the exchanges are the source of their own market data and that they are affiliated with one another the exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available all of the individual underlying feeds and that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors with respect to latency the exchanges have represented that competing vendors could locate their servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed and therefore could receive the underlying data feeds at the same time as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed therefore the exchanges have contended that a competing vendor could obtain the underlying data feeds from the exchanges on the same latency basis as the system that would be performing the aggregation and consolidation of the proposed bats one feed and could provide the same kind of product to its customers with the same latency they could achieve by purchasing the bats one feed from the exchanges the exchanges have also represented that they have designed the bats one feed so that they would have no advantages over a competing vendor with respect to the speed of access to the underlying feeds with respect to pricing although specific fees to be charged for the bats one feed are not part of the proposed rule changes the exchanges have represented that they will assess a fee that is at least equal to the aggregate cost of the underlying feeds ie at least as much as the cost to a vendor of subscribing to each of the underlying data feeds plus an additional amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function performed to create the bats one feed based on the exchanges representations with respect to the content latency and pricing of the bats one feed—which are central to the commissions analysis of the proposal—the commission finds that the exchanges proposals are consistent with the act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges the commission believes that these representations are designed to ensure that bats byx edga and edgx which are separate selfregulatory organizations do not because of their relationship as affiliates offer one another products or services on a more favorable basis than that available to other competing market participants for the foregoing reasons the commission finds that the proposed rule changes as amended are consistent with section acc of the act and rule a of regulation nms start printed page thereunder and sections b and b of the act v accelerated approval of proposed rule changes as modified by amendments no  the amendments no  revised the proposed rule changes to i clarify how the bats one feed would be created ii make additional clarifying statements with respect to the latency and cost of the bats one feed and iii bring together the discussion of key aspects of the description of the proposal in the same section accordingly the commission does not believe that the amendments no  raises any novel regulatory issues and therefore finds that good cause exists to approve the proposals as modified by amendments nos  and  on an accelerated basis vi solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to submit written data views and arguments concerning the foregoing including whether amendments no  to the proposed rule changes are consistent with the act comments may be submitted by any of the following methods electronic comments use the commissions internet

securities exchange act of  “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on july   bats exchange inc the “exchange” or “bats” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the selfregulatory organization the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange proposes to establish a new market data product called the bats one feed as well as to establish related market data fees the text of the proposed bats one feed is attached as exhibit a the proposed changes to the fee schedule are attached as exhibit b exhibits a and b are available on the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the exchanges principal office and at the public reference room of the commission ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the selfregulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the selfregulatory organization has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant aspects of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to establish a new market data product called the bats one feed as described more fully below the bats one feed is a data feed that will disseminate on a realtime basis the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” of all displayed orders for securities traded on bats and its affiliated exchanges  collectively the “bats exchanges” and for which the bats exchanges report quotes under the consolidated start printed page tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed will also contain the individual last sale information for bats and each of its affiliated exchanges in addition the bats one feed will contain optional functionality which will enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated twosided quotations from the bats exchanges for up to five  price levels the bats one feed is designed to meet the needs of prospective members that do not need or are unwilling to pay for the individual book feeds offered by each of the individual bats exchanges in addition the bats one feed offers market data vendors and purchasers a suitable alternative to the use of consolidated data where consolidated data are not required to be purchased or displayed finally the proposed new data feed provides investors with new options for receiving market data and competes with similar market data products offered by nyse technologies an affiliate of the new york stock exchange inc “nyse” and the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” the provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by regulation nms description of the bats one feed the bats one feed will contain the aggregate bbo of the bats exchanges for all securities that are traded on the bats exchanges and for which the bats exchanges report quotes under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the aggregate bbo would include the total size of all orders at the bbo available on all bats exchanges the bats one feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual bats exchanges collectively with the aggregate bbo the “bats one summary feed” the last sale information will include the price size time of execution and individual bats exchange on which the trade was executed the last sale message will also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all bats exchanges for that trading day the exchange will disseminate the aggregate bbo of the bats exchanges and last sale information through the bats one feed no earlier than each individual bats exchange provides its bbo and last sale information to the processors under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also consist of symbol summary market status retail liquidity identifier on behalf of byx trading status and trade break messages the symbol summary message will include the total executed volume across all bats exchanges the market status message is disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the bats exchanges for example the market status message will indicate whether one of the bats exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the bats one feed as part of the aggregated bbo the market status message will also indicate where bats exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated bbo the retail liquidity identifier indicator message will be disseminated via the bats one feed on behalf of byx only pursuant to byxs retail price improvement “rpi” program the retail liquidity identifier indicates when rpi interest priced at least  better than byxs protected bid or protected offer for a particular security is available in the system the exchange proposes to disseminate the retail liquidity indicator via the bats one feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams ie pursuant to the consolidated tape association planconsolidated quotation plan or ctacq for tape a and tape b securities and the nasdaq utp plan for tape c securities as well as through proprietary bats data feeds the retail liquidity identifier will reflect the symbol and the side buy or sell of the rpi interest but does not include the price or size of the rpi interest in particular like cq and utp quoting outputs the bats one feed will include a field for codes related to the retail price improvement identifier the codes indicate rpi interest that is priced better than byxs protected bid or protected offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the program the trade break message will indicate when an execution on a bats exchange is broken in accordance with the individual bats exchanges rules the trading status message will indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual bats exchange for example a trading status message will be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to rule  of regulation sho “short sale circuit breaker” or the security is subject to a trading halt suspension or pause declared by the listing market a trading status message will be sent whenever a securitys trading status changes optional aggregate depth of book the bats one feed will also contain optional functionality which will enable recipients to receive twosided quotations from the bats exchanges for five  price levels for all securities that are traded on the bats exchanges in addition to the bats one summary feed “bats one premium feed” for each price level on one of the bats exchanges the bats one premium feed option of the bats one feed will include a twosided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level bats one feed fees the exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to incorporate fees related to the bats one feed the exchange start printed page proposes to charge different fees to vendors depending on whether the vendor elects to receive i bats one summary feed or ii the optional bats one premium feed these fees include the following each of which are described in detail below i distributor fees  ii usage fees for both professional and nonprofessional users  and iii enterprise fees the amount of each fee may differ depending on whether they use the bats one feed data for internal or external distribution vendors that distribute the bats one feed data both internally and externally will be subject to the higher of the two distribution fees definitions the exchange also proposes to include in its fee schedule the following defined terms that relate to the bats one feed fees “distributor” will be defined as “any entity that receives the bats one feed directly from bats or indirectly through another entity and then distributes it internally or externally to a third party”  “internal distributor” will be defined as a “distributor that receives the bats one feed and then distributes that data to one or more users within the distributors own entity”  “external distributor” will be defined as a “distributor that receives the bats one feed and then distributes that data to one or more users outside the distributors own entity”  “user” will be defined as a “natural person a proprietorship corporation partnership or entity or device computer or other automated service that is entitled to receive exchange data” “nonprofessional user” will be defined as “a natural person who is not i registered or qualified in any capacity with the commission the commodity futures trading commission any state securities agency any securities exchange or association any commodities or futures contract market or association ii engaged as an “investment adviser” as that term is defined in section  of the investment advisers act of  whether or not registered or qualified under that act or iii employed by a bank or other organization exempt from registration under federal or state securities laws to perform functions that will require registration or qualification if such functions were performed for an organization not so exempt”  “professional user” will be defined as “any user other than a nonprofessional user”  internal distribution fees each internal distributor that receives only the bats one summary feed shall pay an internal distributor fee of  per month each internal distributor shall pay an internal distributor fee of  per month where they elect to also receive the bats one premium feed the exchange will charge no usage fees for bats one feed where the data is received and subsequently internally distributed to professional or nonprofessional users external distribution fees the exchange proposes to charge those firms that distribute the bats one feed externally an external distributor fee of  per month for the bats one summary feed each external distributor shall pay an external distributor fee of  per month where they elect to also receive the bats one premium feed the exchange also proposes to establish a new external distributor credit under which new external distributors will not be charged a distributor fee for their first three  months in order to allow them to enlist new users to receive the bats one feed in addition to internal and external distribution fees the exchange also proposes to charge recipient firms who receive the bats one feed from external distributors different fees for both their professional users and nonprofessional users the exchange will assess a monthly fee for professional users of  per user for receipt of the bats one summary feed or  per user who elect to also receive the bats one premium feed nonprofessional users will be assessed a monthly fee of  per user for the bats one summary feed or  per user where they elects to also receive the bats one premium feed external distributors must count every professional user and nonprofessional user to which they provide bats one feed data thus the distributors count will include every person and device that accesses the data regardless of the purpose for which the individual or device uses the data distributors must report all professional and nonprofessional users in accordance with the following in connection with an external distributors distribution of the bats one feed the distributor should count as one user each unique user that the distributor has entitled to have access to the bats one feed however where a device is dedicated specifically to a single individual the distributor should count only the individual and need not count the device the external distributor should identify and report each unique user if a user uses the same unique method to gain access to the bats one feed the distributor should count that as one user however if a unique user uses multiple methods to gain access to the bats one feed eg a single user has multiple passwords and user identifications the external distributor should report all of those methods as an individual user external distributors should report each unique individual person who receives access through multiple devices as one user so long as each device is dedicated specifically to that individual if an external distributor entitles one or more individuals to use the same device the external distributor should start printed page include only the individuals and not the device in the count each external distributor will receive a credit against its monthly distributor fee for the bats one feed equal to the amount of its monthly usage fees up to a maximum of the distributor fee for the bats one feed for example an external distributor will be subject to a  monthly distributor fee where they elect to receive the bats one premium feed if that external distributor reports user quantities totaling  or more of monthly usage of the bats one premium feed it will pay no net distributor fee whereas if that same external distributor were to report user quantities totaling  of monthly usage it will pay a net of  for the distributor fee enterprise fee the exchange also proposes to establish a  per month enterprise fee that will permit a recipient firm who receives the bats summary feed portion of the bats one feed from an external distributor to receive the data for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users and  per month for recipient firms who elect to also receive the bats one premium feed for example if a recipient firm had  professional subscribers who each receive the bats one summary feed portion of the bats one feed at  per month then that recipient firm will pay  per month in professional subscriber fees under the proposed enterprise fee the recipient firm will pay a flat fee of  for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users for the bats summary feed portion of the bats one feed a recipient firm must pay a separate enterprise fee for each external distributor that controls display of the bats one feed if it wishes such subscriber to be covered by an enterprise fee rather than by persubscriber fees a subscriber that pays the enterprise fee will not have to report the number of such subscribers on a monthly basis however every six months a subscriber must provide the exchange with a count of the total number of natural person users of each product including both professional and nonprofessional users implementation date the exchange will announce the effective date of the proposed rule change in a trading notice to be published as soon as practicable following approval of the proposed rule change by the commission the exchange anticipates making available the bats one feed for evaluation as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule change by the commission  statutory basis the bats one feed the exchange believes that the proposed bats one feed is consistent with section b of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and to protect investors and the public interest and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers this proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of the bats one feed the exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section b of the act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with new options for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchangeonly data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed the proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to realtime last sale information and bestbidandoffer information contained in the bats one feed the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability to brokers dealers and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms the commission concluded that regulation nms—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the acts goals of facilitating efficiency and competition efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data the commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data x by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history if the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to brokerdealers at all it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well the bats one feed is precisely the sort of market data product that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms the bats one feed would be distributed and purchased on a voluntary basis in that neither the bats exchanges nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available accordingly distributors and users can discontinue use at any time and for any reason including due to an assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged bats one feed fees the exchange also believes that the proposed fees for the bats one feed are consistent with section b of the act in general and section b of the act in particular in that it sic they provide for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among users and recipients of the data and are not start printed page designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the exchange also notes that products described herein are entirely optional firms are not required to purchase the bats one feed firms have a wide variety of alternative market data products from which to choose moreover the exchange is not required to make these proprietary data products available or to offer any specific pricing alternatives to any customers the decision of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in netcoalition v sec  fd  dc cir  upheld reliance by the securities and exchange commission “commission” upon the existence of market forces to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for proprietary market data in fact the legislative history indicates that the congress intended that the market system evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed and that the sec wield its regulatory power in those situations where competition may not be sufficient such as in the creation of a consolidated transactional reporting system  the court agreed with the commissions conclusion that “congress intended that competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the us national market system for trading equity securities ”  the  doddfrank amendments to the exchange act reinforce the courts conclusions about congressional intent on july   president barack obama signed into law hr  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “doddfrank act” which amended section  of the act among other things section  of the doddfrank act amended paragraph a of section b of the act by inserting the phrase “on any person whether or not the person is a member of the selfregulatory organization” after “due fee or other charge imposed by the selfregulatory organization” as a result all sro rule proposals establishing or changing dues fees or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues fees or other charges are imposed on members of the sro nonmembers or both section  further amended paragraph c of section b of the exchange act to read in pertinent part “at any time within the day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph  of section b the commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the selfregulatory organization made thereby if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title if the commission takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph b of section b to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved” the courts conclusions about congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the doddfrank act amendments which create a presumption that exchange fees including market data fees may take effect immediately without prior commission approval and that the commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the act as explained below in the exchanges statement on burden on competition the exchange believes that there is substantial evidence of competition in the marketplace for data and that the commission can rely upon such evidence in concluding that the fees established in this filing are the product of competition and therefore satisfy the relevant statutory standards in addition the existence of alternatives to these data products such as proprietary last sale data from other sources as described below further ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory when vendors and subscribers can elect such alternatives as the netcoalition decision noted the commission is not required to undertake a costofservice or ratemaking approach user fees the exchange believes that implementing the professional and nonprofessional user fees for the bats one feed is reasonable because it will make the product more affordable and result in their greater availability to professional and nonprofessional users moreover introducing a nonprofessional user fee for the bats one feed is reasonable because it provides an additional method for retail investors to access the bats one feed data and provides the same data that is available to professional users in addition the proposed fees are reasonable when compared to fees for comparable products offered by the nyse nasdaq and under the cta and cq plans specifically nasdaq offers nasdaq basic which includes best bid and offer and last sale data for nasdaq and the finranasdaq trf for a monthly fee of  per professional subscriber and  per nonprofessional subscriber alternatively a brokerdealer may purchase an enterprise license at a rate of  per month for distribution to an unlimited number of nonprofessional users or  per month for up to  professional users plus  for each additional professional user over  the exchange notes that nasdaq basic also offers data for nasdaq omx bx and nasdaq omx psx as described below the nyse offers bqt which provides bbo and last sale information for the nyse nyse arca and nyse mkt for a monthly fee of  per professional subscriber and  per nonprofessional subscriber alternatively a brokerdealer may purchase an enterprise license at a rate of  per month for an unlimited number of professional users the nyse does not offer an enterprise license for nonprofessional users batss proposed peruser fees are lower than the nyses and nasdaqs fees in addition the exchange is proposing professional and nonprofessional user fees and enterprise fees that are less than the fees currently charged by the cta and cq plans under the cta and cq plans tape a consolidated last sale and bidask data are offered together for a monthly fee of  per device depending on the number of professional subscribers and  per nonprofessional subscriber depending on the number of nonprofessional subscribers a monthly enterprise fee of  is available under which a start printed page us registered brokerdealer may distribute data to an unlimited number of its own employees and its nonprofessional subscriber brokerage account customers finally in contrast to nasdaq utp and the cta and cq plans the exchange also will permit enterprise distribution by a nonbrokerdealer enterprise fee the proposed enterprise fee for the bats one feed is reasonable as the fee proposed is less than the enterprise fees currently charged for nyse bqt nasdaq basic and consolidated data distributed under the nasdaq utp and the cta and cq plans in addition the enterprise fee could result in a fee reduction for recipient firms with a large number of professional and nonprofessional users if a recipient firm has a smaller number of professional users of the bats one feed then it may continue using the per user structure and benefit from the per user fee reductions by reducing prices for recipient firms with a large number of professional and nonprofessional users the exchange believes that more firms may choose to receive and to distribute the bats one feed thereby expanding the distribution of this market data for the benefit of investors the exchange further believes that the proposed enterprise fee is reasonable because it will simplify reporting for certain recipients that have large numbers of professional and nonprofessional users firms that pay the proposed enterprise fee will not have to report the number of users on a monthly basis as they currently do but rather will only have to count natural person users every six months which is a significant reduction in administrative burden the exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they will be charged uniformly to recipient firms and users that select these products the fee structure of differentiated professional and nonprofessional fees has long been used by other exchanges for their proprietary data products and by the nasdaq utp and the cta and cq plans in order to reduce the price of data to retail investors and make it more broadly available offering the bats one feed to nonprofessional users with the same data available to professional users results in greater equity among data recipients finally the exchange believes that it is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to establish an enterprise fee because it reduces the exchanges costs and the distributors administrative burdens in tracking and auditing large numbers of users distribution fee the exchange believes that the proposed distribution fees are also reasonable equitably allocated and not unreasonably discriminatory the fees for members and nonmembers are uniform except with respect to reasonable distinctions with respect to internal and external distribution the exchange believes that the distribution fees for the bats one feed are reasonable and fair in light of alternatives offered by other market centers first although the internal distribution fee is higher than those of competitor products there are no usage fees assessed for users that receive the bats one feed data through internal distribution which results in a net cost that is lower than competitor products for many data recipients and will be easier to administer in addition for external distribution the distribution fees are similar to or lower than similar products for example under the nasdaq utp and cta and cq plans consolidated last sale and bidask data are offered for a combined monthly fee of  for redistribution the exchange is proposing distribution fees that are less than the fees currently charged by the nasdaq utp and cta and cq plans b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act as amended an exchanges ability to price its proprietary data feed products is constrained by actual competition for the sale of proprietary market data products the joint product nature of exchange platforms and the existence of alternatives to the exchanges proprietary last sale data because other exchanges already offer similar products the exchanges proposed bats one feed will enhance competition specifically the bats one feed was developed to compete with similar market data products offered by nasdaq and nyse technologies an affiliate of the nyse the bats one feed will foster competition by providing an alternative market data product to those offered by nasdaq and the nyse for less cost as described in more detail in section b above this proposed new data feed provides investors with new options for receiving market data which was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by regulation nms the proposed bats one feed would enhance competition by offering a market data product that is designed to compete directly with similar products offered by the nyse and nasdaq nasdaq basic is a product that includes two feeds qbbo which provides bbo information for all us exchangelisted securities on nasdaq and nls plus which provides last sale data as well as consolidated volume from the following nasdaq omx markets for us exchangelisted securities nasdaq finranasdaq trf nasdaq omx bx and nasdaq omx psx likewise nyse bqt includes bbo and last sale information for the nyse nyse arca and nyse mkt as a result nasdaq basic and nyse bqt comprise a significant view of the market on any given day and both include data from multiple trading venues as the bats exchanges are consistently one of the top exchange operators by market share for us equities trading excluding opening and closing auction volume the data included within the bats one feed start printed page will provide investors with an alternative to nasdaq basic and nyse bqt and a new option for obtaining a broad market view consistent with the primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by regulation nms the bats one feed will not only provide content that is competitive with the similar products offered by other exchanges but will provide pricing that is competitive as well as previously stated the fees for the bats one feed are significantly lower than alternative exchange products the bats one feed is  less expensive per professional user and more than  less expensive for an enterprise license for professional users  less for nonprofessional users when compared to a similar competitor exchange product offering firms a lower cost alternative for similar content as the exchange considers the integration of the bats one feed into external distributor products an important ingredient to the products success the exchange has designed pricing that enables external distributors to spend three months integrating bats one feed data into their products and to enlist new users to receive the bats one feed data for free with no external distribution charges in addition the exchange is providing external distributors a credit against their monthly external distribution fee equal to the amount of its monthly usage fees up to the amount of the external distribution fee which could result in the external distributor paying a discounted or no external distribution fee once the free three months period has ended with the fee incentives in place external distributors may freely choose to include the bats one feed data into their product thereby increasing competition with external distributors offering similar products replace alternative data provided by nasdaq basic or nyse bqt with the bats one feed data or enhance their product to include bats one feed data along with data offered by competitors to create a distributor product that may be more valuable than the bats one feed or any competitor product alone as with any product the recipients of the data will determine the value of the data provided by the exchange directly or through an external distributor potential subscribers may opt to disfavor the bats one feed based on the content provided or the pricing and may believe that alternatives offer them better value accordingly the exchange does not believe that the proposed bats one feed will impair the ability of external distributors or competing venues to maintain their competitive standing in the financial markets the exchange believes the bats one feed will further enhance competition by providing external distributors with a data feed that allows them to more quickly and efficiently integrate into their existing products today distributors subscribe to various market data products offered by single exchanges and resell that data either separately or in the aggregate to their subscribers as part of the their own market data offerings distributors may incur administrative costs when consolidating and augmenting the data to meet their subscribers need consequently many external distributors will simply choose to not take the data because of the effort and cost required to aggregate data from separate feeds into their existing products those same distributors have expressed interest in the bats one feed so that they may easily incorporate aggregated or summarized bats exchange data into their own products without themselves incurring the costs of the repackaging and aggregating the data it would receive by subscribing to each market data product offered by the individual bats exchanges the exchange therefore believes that by providing market data that encompasses combined data from affiliated exchanges the exchange enables certain external distributors with the ability to compete in the provision of similar content with other external distributors where they may not have done so previously if they were required to subscribe to the depthofbook feeds from each individual bats exchange although the exchange considers the acceptance of the bats one feed by external distributors as important to the success of the product depending on their needs external distributors may choose not to subscribe to the bats one feed and may rather receive the bats exchange individual market data products and incorporate them into their specific market data products for example the bats premium feed provides depthofbook information for up to five price levels while each of the bats exchanges individual data feeds offer complete depthofbook and are not limited to five price levels those subscribers who wish to view the complete depthofbook from each individual bats exchange may prefer to subscribe to one or all of individual bats exchange depthofbook data feeds instead of the bats one feed the bats one feed simply provides another option for distributors to choose from when selecting a product that meets their market data needs subscribers who seek a broader market view but do not need complete depthofbook may select the bats one feed while subscribers that seek the complete depthofbook information may subscribe to the depthofbook feeds of each individual bats exchanges latency the bats one feed is not intended to compete with similar products offered by external distributors rather it is intended to assist external distributors in incorporating aggregated and summarized data from the bats exchanges into their own market data products that are provided to the end user therefore distributors will receive the data who will in turn make available bats one feed to their end users either separately or as incorporated into the various market data products they provide as stated above distributors have expressed a desire for a product like the bats one feed so that they may easily incorporate aggregated or summarized bats exchange data into their own products without themselves incurring the administrative costs of repackaging and aggregating the data it would receive by subscribing to each market data product offered by the individual bats exchanges notwithstanding the above the exchange believes that external distributors may create a product similar to bats one feed based on the market data products offered by the individual bats exchanges with minimal latency difference in order to create the bats one feed the exchange will receive the individual data feeds from each bats exchange and in turn aggregate and summarize that data to create the bats one feed this is the same process an external distributor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the bats one feed to distribute to its end users in addition the servers of most external distributors are likely located in the same facilities as the exchange and therefore should receive the individual data feed from each bats exchange on or about the same time the exchange would for it to create the bats one feed therefore the exchange believes that it will not incur any potential latency advantage that start printed page will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the existence of actual competition the market for proprietary data products is currently competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings and order flow and sales of market data itself providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to compete in any or all of those areas including by producing and distributing their own market data proprietary data products are produced and distributed by each individual exchange as well as other entities in a vigorously competitive market competitive markets for listings order flow executions and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products and therefore constrain markets from overpricing proprietary market data the us department of justice also has acknowledged the aggressive competition among exchanges including for the sale of proprietary market data itself in announcing that the bid for nyse euronext by nasdaq omx group inc and intercontinental exchange inc had been abandoned assistant attorney general christine varney stated that exchanges “compete head to head to offer realtime equity data products these data products include the best bid and offer of every exchange and information on each equity trade including the last sale”  it is common for brokerdealers to further exploit this recognized competitive constraint by sending their order flow and transaction reports to multiple markets rather than providing them all to a single market as a  commission concept release noted the “current market structure can be described as dispersed and complex” with “trading volume    dispersed among many highly automated trading centers that compete for order flow in the same stocks” and “trading centers offering a wide range of services that are designed to attract different types of market participants with varying trading needs”  in addition in the case of products that are distributed through market data vendors the vendors themselves provide additional price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to certain end users these vendors impose price discipline based upon their business models for example vendors that assess a surcharge on data they sell are able to refuse to offer proprietary products that their end users do not or will not purchase in sufficient numbers internet portals such as google impose price discipline by providing only data that they believe will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue similarly vendors will not elect to make available the products described herein unless their customers request them and customers will not elect to purchase them unless they can be used for profitgenerating purposes all of these operate as constraints on pricing proprietary data products joint product nature of exchange platform transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service in fact market data and trade executions are a paradigmatic example of joint products with joint costs the decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platforms where the order can be posted including the execution fees data quality and price and distribution of their data products the more trade executions a platform does the more valuable its market data products become the costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure but also the costs of designing maintaining and operating the exchanges transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence the total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs moreover an exchanges brokerdealer customers view the costs of transaction executions and market data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange other market participants have noted that the liquidity provided by the order book trade execution core market data and noncore market data are joint products of a joint platform and have common costs the exchange agrees with and adopts those discussions and the arguments therein the exchange also notes that the economics literature confirms that there is no way to allocate common costs between joint products that would shed any light on competitive or efficient pricing analyzing the cost of market data product production and distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data and market data products will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data and data products thus because it is impossible to obtain the data inputs to create market data products without a fast technologically robust and wellregulated execution system system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of both obtaining the market data start printed page itself and creating and distributing market data products it would be equally misleading however to attribute all of an exchanges costs to the market data portion of an exchanges joint products rather all of an exchanges costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow executing andor routing orders and generating and selling data about market activity the total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products the level of competition and contestability in the market is evident in the numerous alternative venues that compete for order flow including eleven equities selfregulatory organization “sro” markets as well as internalizing brokerdealers “bds” and various forms of alternative trading systems “atss” including dark pools and electronic communication networks “ecns” competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return that each platform earns from the sale of its joint products but different platforms may choose from a range of possible and equally reasonable pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs for example some platforms may choose to pay rebates to attract orders charge relatively low prices for market data products or provide market data products free of charge and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates or no rebates to attract orders setting relatively high prices for market data products and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity in this environment there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering existence of alternatives as stated above brokerdealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow including eleven sro markets as well as internalizing bds and various forms of atss including dark pools and ecns each sro market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions and two finraregulated trade reporting facilities “trfs” compete to attract internalized transaction reports competitive markets for order flow executions and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products the large number of sros trfs bds and atss that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products each sro trf ats and bd is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products and many currently do so or have announced plans to do so including nasdaq nyse nyse amex and nysearca any ats or bd can combine with any other ats bd or multiple atss or bds to produce joint proprietary data products additionally order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple brokerdealers production of proprietary data products the potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless the fact that proprietary data from atss bds and vendors can bypass sros is significant in two respects first nonsros can compete directly with sros for the production and sale of proprietary data products as bats and arca did before registering as exchanges by publishing proprietary book data on the internet second because a single order or transaction report can appear in an sro proprietary product a nonsro proprietary product or both the data available in proprietary products is exponentially greater than the actual number of orders and transaction reports that exist in the marketplace retail brokerdealers such as schwab and fidelity offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue although the business models may differ these vendors pricing discipline is the same they can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value the exchange and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully in addition to the competition and price discipline described above the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid and inexpensive the history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers archipelago bloomberg tradebook island redibook attain and tracecn a proliferation of dark pools and other atss operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume regulation nms by deregulating the market for proprietary data has increased the contestability of that market while brokerdealers have previously published their proprietary data individually regulation nms encourages market data vendors and brokerdealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale including bloomberg and thomsonreuters competitive forces constrain the prices that platforms can charge for noncore market information a trading platform cannot generate market information unless it receives trade orders for this reason a platform can be expected to use its market data product as a tool for attracting liquidity and trading to its exchange while by definition information that is proprietary to an exchange cannot be obtained elsewhere this does not enable the owner of such information to exercise monopoly power over that information visàvis firms with the need for such information even though market information from one platform may not be a perfect substitute for market information from one or more other platforms the existence of alternative sources of information can be expected to constrain the prices platforms charge for market data besides the fact that similar information can be obtained elsewhere the feasibility of supracompetitive pricing is constrained by the traders ability to shift their trades elsewhere which lowers the activity on the exchange and thus in the long run reduces the quality of the information generated by the exchange competition among platforms has driven the exchange to improve its platform data offerings and to cater to customers data needs by proposing the bats one feed the vigor of competition for noncore data information is significant and the exchange believes that this proposal clearly evidences such competition the exchange proposes the bats one feed and pricing model in order to keep pace with changes in the industry and evolving customer needs it is entirely optional and is geared towards attracting new customers as well as retaining existing customers the exchange has witnessed competitors creating new products and innovative pricing in this space over the course of the past year in all cases firms make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume on the basis of the total cost of interacting with the exchange or other exchanges the explicit data fees are but one factor in a total platform analysis some competitors have lower transactions fees and higher data fees and others are vice versa the market for this noncore data start printed page information is highly competitive and continually evolves as products develop and change in establishing the proposed fees the exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition the exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors and has not considered irrelevant factors in order to establish fair reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all users the existence of numerous alternatives to the exchanges products including proprietary data from other sources ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory because vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost is not justified by the returns that any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase c selfregulatory organizations statement on
