really appreciate any help with this topic thanks i have the same question show  likes this content has been marked as final  show  replies re urgent  can hb visa holder start llc as passive owner seeker may    am in response to fresh that is what i knew from old days maybe rules changedllc  need to have at least green cardc corp  need to have at least green cards corp  need to be us citizen  not sure with green cardmake sure you have a legal profit agreement with your partner your being passive partner or hb restricted should not make him ringing bells in his mind re urgent  can hb visa holder start llc as passive owner lalithabrahma jul    pm in response to fresh congrats your best bet would be to consult a lawyer with your specific case you may need to consult with an immigration lawyer and corporate lawyer you have two options one is locate attorneys in your local area and get the consultation and then proceed accordingly second one is to pre pay for a membership for an experienced legal services plan and have access to various lawyers in any area of law for unlimited consultation lalithafor educational series on how to protect your family and grow your business peacefully visit to wwwlalithabrahmacom re urgent  can hb visa holder start llc as passive owner sstefanov jan    pm in response to fresh hi fresh  my question is the same as yours can you inform me how did it developed could you become a passive partner as hb in llc together with an us citizen re urgent  can hb visa holder start llc as passive owner evoglobe nov    am in response to fresh guys does nobody search the internet all your answers are wronghere is the right answer source greencardbaseforming a us corporationhttpwwwgreencardbasecomimagesspacegifmany foreign nationals have asked us questions about forming a corporation therefore we would like to answer some of these questions however please remember that individual cases usually require specifically tailored answers forming a us corporation can foreign nationals start a corporation in the united states yes typically a foreign national can form a us corporation the corporation will be formed by an incorporator which is often a company or a lawyer who will then resign in favor of the shareholders owners of the corporation the corporation will be registered with the secretary of state division of corporations the name of the proposed corporation should be checked with the secretary of state for availability no two corporations may have the same name or closely similar names the corporate name must include the word corporation incorporation company or such other word or abbreviation such as inc or corp to indicate that it is a corporation the shareholders owners need not be identified or registered the shareholders can be individuals or other corporations including foreign corporations at least one director must be shown in the articles of incorporation one person or a number of people can hold all corporate positions and titles director president secretary and treasurer that person or persons need not be residents of the united states and can conduct business from outside of the united states it is required that the corporation always identify a registered office in the us and a registered agent who must be a resident of that state  how much capital is required in certain circumstances it can be done with as little as  capital although typically a larger investment is required this would work out for example  value per share for  shares therefore a large capital investment is not always necessary in the united stateswhat are the types of corporation that can be formed there are three types of corporations a c corporation is responsible for the debts of the corporation but not the individual shareholders the net profits are taxed and the dividends are paid to the shareholders who may have to report the dividends as income s corporations have the same functions and benefits as c corporations except that they can have no more than  shareholders and that the shareholders must be us residents for tax purposes holders of an e investor visa l visa and even b tourist visa if they pay taxes in the us can qualify to be shareholders of an s corporation the main advantage of the s corporation is that the corporations net profits are passed on to the shareholders and are not taxable to the corporation a limited liability company llc is a corporation with limited liability similar to a s corporation yet with several significant differences one major difference is that it requires at least two persons to form an llc the owners need not be us citizens or us taxpayers there are a number of other differences that cannot be fully addressed in this article whether or not an llc qualifies to be taxed like an s corporation should be discussed with a tax advisor  must i live in the united states no a person can ask an incorporator to form the corporation without being in the us the incorporator can sign the articles of incorporation the president and secretary must sign the shares giving ownership to the shareholders later the shareholder can sign documents at the required annual meeting  social security or tax numberhow do i get one social security numbers are available only to us citizens green card holders or people holding a us visa which allows them to legally work in the us others may apply for a taxpayer number from the internal revenue service if they must file a us tax return corporations must apply for a taxpayer identification number with the internal revenue service the application must be signed by an official of the new corporation if that person does not have a social security number then a copy of his foreign passport must be attached to the application if the corporation will sell products to the general public it must also apply for a sales tax number from the state department of revenue and collect sales tax businesses are also required to hold a business license available from the city where the business is located  must i open a business in the united states no it is not required that corporations operate a business you can incorporate yourself which may be used for the sole purpose of owning real estate however an active business must be established to qualify for an e investor or l intra company transfer although this business could be a real estate investment or activity corporation  can a foreign national invest money in any venture a person on an hb or other temporary work visa in the united states can legally invest in any venture or company you can start to undertake volunteer work on behalf of the venture or company at any time however you are not allowed to work on a fulltime basis for that company and earn a salary until obtaining prior approval from the ins or dol to work for that venture or company in order for the person on an hb to work for another company or employer the person is required to obtain a concurrent hb approval to work for the new entity in addition to the present employerhope this helps re urgent  can hb visa holder start llc as passive owner vince nov    am in

floatingpartnering in companies any person can open a business if they have an ssn in reality only us citizens or permanent residents can own a business this is often misunderstood and people land in trouble especially when they receive an interview call for a green card if they request a tax return they will clearly understand that you have violated laws by operating a business an hb holder can only work for the employer who provided sponsorshiphb is a temporary visa and there are no provisions to make extra money outside the hb employment which is not legal do not follow guidelines of states or tax agencies hb holders must follow guidelines of uscis and no where immigration laws mention that hb holders can ownpartner in businesses andor buy property uscis provides guidelines when
