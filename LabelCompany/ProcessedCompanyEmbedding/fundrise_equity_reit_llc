world of internetbased real estate crowdfunding it may be time to start paying attention the training wheels have been removed and now online real estate equity fundraising is about to put on a pair of bigboy pants source  fundrise sec filing nov   crowdfunded real estate in the us has been almost exclusively offered on a project by project basis to accredited investors because of how the rules have evolved since the passage of the jobs act in  crowdfunded real estate investments can have projected returns of  to  or higher typical projected holding periods can be from  months to over  years but they generally range from  to  months one issue holding back some accredited investors was the inherent difficulty of creating a diversified portfolio within the real estate crowdfunded portion of their portfolio minimum investment amounts typically have been  to  which makes creating a diversified portfolio of crowdfunded investments difficult for investors with less than  to  to allocate to just crowdfunded real estate source finraorg in attempt to help with diversification fundrise has recently offered a few portfolio investments for accredited investors allowing them to invest in more than one project the big news the  million fundrise ereit will be structured as a blind pool which will investment in a diversified portfolio of both debt and equity real estate investments which are more fully described in the preliminary offering circular form a filed with the sec this gives investors looking for higher yields the option of investing  in a diverse pool of professionally managed assets may appear to be a far more appealing option this certainly will attract interest from existing accredited customers as well as help to attract new investors to the fundrise platform who now can qualify under the regulation a rules according to the release the  fundrise real estate investment trust intends to invest in a diverse portfolio of us commercial real estate properties such as apartments shopping centers and office buildings that generate cash flow paid out to investors in regular dividends the fundrise ereit sponsor has facilitated or originated  real estate programs previously on its platform with an aggregate purchase price of  billion as of august   of the  billion aggregate real estate purchase prices our sponsor offered through its programs approximately  million consisting of approximately  million of commercial real estate loan assets  million of investments in commercial real estate through majorityowned subsidiaries with rights to receive preferred economic returns and  million of other commercial real estate investments notably the  billion value includes a  financing participation for  world trade center in manhattan which skews the aggregate number higher real estate crowdfunding  background the rate of growth for the largest and most successful real estate crowdfunding platforms has been exponential during the past two years in some ways real estate crowdfunding is like the wild west with new platforms popping up each month many crowdfunding sites have a similar look and feel and it can be daunting to try and sort out the serious players from the potential flybynight outfits based upon my research the one characteristic the top platforms all have in common is the ability to prefund and close on a real estate investment before turning around and offering it to the public platforms which prefund have all been evaluated by financial institutions private equity andor venture capital firms and have typically received  million or more in funding these investors are often attracted to the scalable nature of these online investing platforms fundrise investors include renren inc nasdaq renn as well as wellknown private real estate firms three distinct examples of successful real estate crowdfunding platforms are prodigy network equity  large nyc residential and mixed use patch of land senior debt  residential valueadd and fundrise preferred equity  existing and new commercial each of these platforms offer an assortment of debt and equity investments but i chose to emphasize the predominant asset class which differentiates them i have interviewed ceos from all three platforms during the past year and written a brief overview of each platform which can be found here here and here will crowdsourcing disrupt other models one asset class that might be at risk over time from crowdsourced reit investment alternatives would be the nontraded reits which are typically sold by investment advisors the nontraded reit space has recently attracted quite a bit of scrutiny and negative press bad behavior by some players including high frontloaded fees has come home to roost these fees typically ranged from  and were not always fully disclosed by advisors regulatory agencies including the department of labor and the sec have stepped in and new rules are being put into place including finra rn  for  source cnlsecuritiescom here is a link to an sec investor bulletin from aug   which includes this bold print warning for investors these fees can represent up to  percent of the offering price which lowers the value and return of your investment and leaves less money for the reit to invest many accredited investors have been sold these nontraded reit products by financial advisors in the past only to discover that it is difficult to create alpha when only  of the investment is actually used to buy real estate there are also high quality nontraded reit alternatives such as wp carey inc nyse wpc with a  year history of delivering  or better returns for loyal fund investors there have been  wpc funds that have gone fullcycle and no longterm investor has ever lost money since us crowdfunded real estate is a new asset class industry pioneers can only have a four year track record this severely limits the number of projects which have come fullcycle with a return of capital and the ability to calculate an irr or roic more netproceeds to invest underwriting costs and discounts associated with a typical ipo distributed by wall street investment banks can eat up  or more of an offering by utilizing the fundrise online platform to distribute the  authorized shares the organizational fees described in the form a offering appear to be   there were zero fees included for underwriting discounts and commissions notably organizational and offering costs estimated to be  will also be reimbursed to the fund manager over time investors will not pay upfront selling commissions in connection with the purchase of our common shares we will reimburse our manager for organization and offering costs which are expected to be approximately  reimbursement payments will be made in monthly installments but the aggregate monthly amount reimbursed can never exceed  of the aggregate gross offering proceeds from this offering the fundrise reit entity organizational chart below is difficult to read which is unfortunate but was taken directly from the nov   sec filing source  fundrise sec filing nov   there is no such thing as a free lunch there will be fee payments to sponsor affiliates for ongoing services performed which include a  annual fee and a  to  affiliate management fee as usual interested investors should do their own due diligence to understand these and other fees which are charged depending upon the circumstances for instance there is a fee that can be charged to deal with nonperforming assets and fees to compensate for underwriting costs putting the crowd back into funding recently there has been a trend in real estate crowdfunding platforms to turn to institutions for a large percentage of an individual project funding the  to  returns projected for a typical crowdfunded deal are attracting institutions with access to low cost funds retail investors may not realize that they are often investing side by side with institutions if you think about it these crowdfunding firms have built underwriting and distribution platforms to handle a high volume of transactions once a platform has been vetted it can be more efficient for an institution to utilize a crowdfunding site to originate deals the platform gains more visibility regarding its fund raising and therefore is able to grow at a faster rate fundrise cofounder dan miller discussed this growing trend of crowdfunding without the crowd in a july  interview with therealdealcom the fundrise ereit initiative clearly helps to combat this trend it also represents a huge leap forward for the original vision for fundrise…a goal to democratize commercial real estate investment which ben miller shared with me last summer my understanding is that fundrise would be able to offer a  million ereit every  months under the current rules investor takeaway like any other investment the fundrise reit contains risks as you would expect there are plenty of them discussed in the preliminary offering document the document follows the s disclosure format so it is similar in many respects to what you would expect to find in any ipo prospectus initially the fundrise reit shares are valued at  apiece after july  the reit nav will be calculated at the end of each quarter and will be used to value the shares the reit intends to pay quarterly distributions the major attraction but of course there are no guarantees there is a modicum of liquidity on a quarterly basis which is discussed in the offering this is another plus for the fundrise reit vs most crowdfunding options however this reit is essentially an illiquid investment and only suitable for investors who dont need the funds to pay the rent buy groceries or cover next semesters tuition many seeking alpha readers are aware that i regularly write about publicly traded reits and similar publicly traded investments they have the advantage of liquidity more stringent reporting requirements and in most cases a longer track record for investors to evaluate a simple method for investors to include real estate as an alternative investment for their portfolio would be to invest in reit funds or etfs the vanguard reit index etf nysearca vnq currently pays a distribution yielding just under  here is a link to an article which i wrote about reit etfs and portfolio diversification for investors who arent familiar with this asset class meanwhile investors with a longer time horizon looking for higher yield will soon have the fundrise reit to consider disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in wpc vnq over the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking

classes for investors who would like to diversify their portfolio or simply do not enjoy the volatile nature of the stock market contrary to popular belief one does not need to be extremely wealthy to have interests in property in the past investing in real estate especially large commercial properties was something that was only reserved for high net worth individuals hnwi however the rise of online real estate crowdfunding platforms and publicly traded real estate investment trusts reits have made it a lot easier for the average investor to get access to real estate investments fundrise for example is one of the many online crowdfunding marketplaces out there that have pooled relatively small sums of money from everyday people and used those funds to assist property developers to finance their projects to date developers on the website have raised more than  million founded in  by two brothers named benjamin and dan miller fundrise recently made headlines when it announced the launch of the worlds first online reit or as they call it ereit earlier this month fundrise began processing subscriptions for their  million initial public offering ipo but they were quickly forced to temporarily discontinue selling shares of the ereit due to high demand on the first day of the offering fundrise received an average of  in subscription requests every minute investors were required to purchase a minimum of  shares at a rate of  per share although the fundrise ereit looks like it will be a very promising investment it certainly is not for everyone here are three important things to ask yourself when determining whether or not an equity stake in fundrises ereit would make sense in your investment portfolio do you mind investing in an illiquid asset one of the main differences between fundrises ereit and traditional reits is the level of liquidity traditional reits are traded on a stock exchange and are given a mark to market mtm valuation every minute of a trading day this gives investors the ability to sell a portion or all of their reits within a couple of minutes if needed the fundrise ereit is not listed on an exchange and as a result units can only be redeemed at the end of each quarter this can help to force an investor to take a longterm horizon but it can also be a problem if an investor needs immediate access to cash for an emergency see also fundrise ceo ben miller on why prefunding matters do you need the income federal law requires that all reits distribute no less than  of their annual income to their unit holders fundrise’s ereit is not excluded from this requirement as a result the company intends to make a high yield cash distribution at the end of every quarter this can be great for those investors who are looking to create an additional revenue stream however the ereit might not be ideal for investors who do not immediately need investment income it is important to remember that unlike corporate dividends that are taxed at a low rate reit distributions are taxed at the normal income tax rate this is why reits are often called taxinefficient investments investors who own reits tend to hold them in retirement accounts that have favorable tax treatments like a roth ira but it is not possible to do this with the fundrise ereit in some cases an investor may end up realizing higher net returns and a lower tax bill by investing in a stock that reinvests the majority of earnings instead of distributing it to shareholders how risk tolerant are you fundrise’s ereit is probably not suitable for your investment portfolio if you consider your tolerance for risk to be low or fairly moderate as a new investment fund the ereit has no previous operating history to look at in order to determine how good the management team is this also makes it hard to make calculated predictions on how well the ereit will perform in the future when compared to the management teams of publicly traded reits the management of fundrise’s ereit lacks many years of experience in the company’s offering circular that was filed with the security and exchange commission sec it was disclosed that the ereits initial management team consists of four members the oldest of whom is only yearsold furthermore the ereit had no nonexecutive board members at the time of writing depending on your age and overall goals an investment in the ereit might be worth the speculation on the other hand other investors might not feel comfortable with the risk associated with the startup nature of the ereit publicly traded reits might be a much more suitable alternative for conservative investors like retirees who want a reliable flow of income while protecting their principal see also  ways millennials can invest in rental properties the bottom line reits and property crowdfunding platforms have made it extremely easy for the average investor to include real estate investments in his or her portfolio just this month fundrise a crowdfunding website launched the world’s first internet reit like traditional reits fundrise’s ereit will give its unitholders the opportunity to benefit from incomeproducing property while ereits are similar to traditional reits in that respect there are a number of differences between the two for instance shares in fundrise’s ereit can only be redeemed at the end of each quarter and as such may not be a suitable investment for many retail investors additionally the ereit might be taxinefficient for young investors who could benefit much more by realizing capital gains rather than investment income conservatives investors should also note that fundrise is a new player in the reit business and as such may be riskier than other reits because of its unproven track record trending

to offer novel product for real estate investorsfundrise the crowdfunding platform for commercial real estate investors last week filed plans with the securities and exchange commission to launch an offering under regulation a for a real estate investment trust reit regulation a a modification of an earlier rule results from title iv of the jumpstart our business startups jobs act of  it allows nonaccredited investors to purchase certain securities that previously were available only to accredited investors the filing a preliminary offering circular seeks permission to launch a  million ipo for the fundrise real estate investment trust llc the reit shares will be available for sale only on fundrises website not through brokers or exchanges by eliminating broker fees and distributing shares online fundrise will reduce the offerings costs and the savings of  to  percent of upfront expenses will be passed down to investors according to the filing by invoking regulation a fundrise avoids having to register the reit shares with the sec and allows nonaccredited investors access to the reit shares an accredited investor has either  million in net wealth excluding a primary residence or income of at least   for joint tax filers in each of the previous two years regulation a provides a safe harbor for companies to raise up to  million through the public issuance of nonregistered securities up to now real estate crowdfunding platforms could market to the general public but could only sell securities to accredited investors regulation a which went live in may  stems from title iv of the jobs act and should not be confused with title iii equity crowdfunding rules now in final review and slated to become operational in the second quarter of nonaccredited investors will be able to invest in the fundrise reit to the extent of  percent of their net worth or annual income whichever is greater fundrise will price the reit shares at  each meaning that folks with net worth or annual income as low as  will be able to invest reits are basically mutual funds for real estate properties when you buy reit shares you own a proportional amount of the underlying portfolio of real estate investments controlled by the reit manager reits are a way for investors to achieve instant diversification within the real estate sector reit investors are completely passive in that they have no managerial responsibilities related to the portfolio properties in its filing fundrise explicitly points out a number of risks to investors includingrequiring investors to hold their shares for up to three months as share redemption will be available on a quarterly basisthe reit shares may turn out not be safe and viablethe disclosures required of a regulation a reit are substantially less than those of registered listed reits simply put investors will have less information with which to make decisionsfundrise has no experience as a reit operatorthere is no secondary

traditional reit free course youtube videos blog podcast forum subscribe advertise ask sal a question home • free intro crowdfunding course review of fundrise’s ereit vs traditional reit published by salvador briggman find him on twitter i’ve been talking a lot about real estate crowdfunding in the last year i’ve even gone so far as to write an amazon ebook on the topic the reason that i want to put recf on everyone’s radar along with fundrise’s new income and growth ereit is because i believe that technology is fundamentally changing a historically archaic industry whenever an industry is being disrupted by a tech startup my ears perk up you can smell opportunity in the air i love it however just because these new investment options exist doesn’t mean that they are right for you that’s why i want to delve indepth into some of the differences between an ereit and a traditional reit along with whether or not you should add a fundrise ereit to your real estate investment portfolio a traditional reit reits or real estate investment trusts came about in the s to give investors a way to invest in real estate the way they invest in stocks basically the reit owns incomeproducing real estate and you as the investor own shares of the reit these shares pay out dividends and naturally have market value as of  “the global index included  stock exchange listed real estate companies from  countries representing an equity market capitalization of about  trillion with approximately  of that total from reits” the majority of reits out there are publicly traded on the stock market giving them a high degree of liquidity if you want to get out of an investment you just have to sell your shares when you’re investing there are two types of reits to choose from equity reits and mortgage reits as you’d guess equity reits focus on delivering dividends to their investors from incomeproducing properties the mangers of these properties will be collecting rents from residential and commercial real estate you’ll also benefit from their efforts spent buying and selling assets that are a part of the portfolio on the other hand mortgage reits invest in real estate mortgages and mortgagedbacked securities think of these as simple debt or fixedincome investments you’ll be collecting dividends when the mortgages pay out interest or when the portfolio managers sell off mortgages mortgage reits are also publicly traded if you’d like to learn more about reits i’d recommend checking out this simple guide which provides a good overview of the investment class the biggest takeaway from traditional reits is that they’re liquid publicly traded bought through a broker fundrise’s ereit fundrise announced the launch of their ereit at the end of  and it’s been growing like wildfire with over  million already invested in  their ereit falls under the newly created regulation a rules which allows offers to solicit investment from the general public for up to  million over a continuous period this means that both accredited and nonaccredited investors can invest in their income or growth ereit with investment minimums as low a  fundrise’s ereit is similar to a traditional reit but there are a few key exceptions liquidity the ereit is not publicly traded this is both a pro and a con on the positive side the price of your shares is not subject to the volatility of the stock market on the downside it’s not as easy for you to instantly sell your shares and get out of the investment think of it as more of a longterm investment fees and investment model when you’re purchasing a traditional reit you’re going through a broker you make the order and they make the purchase you’re naturally going to incur fees from the middle man with fundrise you’re purchasing the securities directly through the platform you’re directly interacting with the offerer that’s why the fees will differ with fundrise “assuming a fully subscribed offering each ereit anticipates having a reimbursement of organizational expenses of approximately  marketing and distribution expenses of each offering up to  and annual ongoing asset management fees and operational expenses of approximately  ongoing asset management fees of between  is significantly lower than the fees that are associated with a traditional reit which also doesn’t take into account broker costs remember how we divided traditional reits into the equity or mortgage category you can adopt a similar mindset when looking through the fundrise growth ereit and income ereit the website reads “the income ereit intends to acquire assets that pay returns on a more current basis which is anticipated to produce more predictable and reliable cash flows however the growth ereit intends to acquire assets that it expects to have greater appreciation over time which may produce larger returns but less frequent distributions” basically the growth ereit focuses on equity assets that appreciate over time and produce cashflows and the income ereit focuses on debt or fixedincome assets that produce cashflows from interest payments the biggest takeaway is that you can use fundrise to invest in real estate with lower fees but the reits won’t be publicly traded which should you choose it comes down to your investment goals time horizon and comfort when it comes to risk keep in mind that all investments are inherently risky real estate crowdfunding is no different al if you’re interested in learning more about real estate crowdfunding go and check out my other website with all of my best content on
