investment objectives risks charges and expenses of a fund before investing prospectuses for the funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling tollfree at  or visiting wwwftportfolioscom a prospectus should be read carefully before investingpast performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original costprincipal risk factors a funds shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a funds investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filingsan index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index funds shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index funds return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fundinvestors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the shares net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creationredemption units if the funds authorized participants are unable to proceed with creationredemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the funds net asset value and possibly face delistingone of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in valuean actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a funds investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or subadvisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired resulta fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographicallycertain funds may invest in smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companiesan investment in a fund containing securities of nonus issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting nonus issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading marketread moreinvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal andor interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligationsa fund that invests in the european region is subject to certain risks because member states in the european union no longer control their own monetary policies money supply and official interest rates for the euro rather such control is exercised by the european central bankcertain securities held by certain of the funds are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and zero coupon risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floatingrate loans and highyield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higheryielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a funds fixedincome investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixedincome securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a funds income zero coupon risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fallsenior floatingrate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of highyield fixed income instruments highyield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations andor other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for highyield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securitiesincome from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer income from municipal bonds held by a fund may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income taxconvertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivativesexchangetraded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factorsreal estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recessionmaster limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that an mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlpthe use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a funds portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a funds return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fundthe stocks of companies that have recently conducted an initial public offering have exhibited aboveaverage price appreciation in connection with the initial public offering prior to inclusion in a fund which may not continue and these investments may be subject to additional risks price volatility and speculative tradinga fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than inkind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less taxefficient than an investment in an exchangetraded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for inkind securitiescommodity futures contracts traded on nonus exchanges or with
