the football player walk into a bar to support gay marriage featured money  power this just in mayo a shattuck iii still rich despite everyone else being not so rich  written by robert obrien  tuesday oct   am tweet former constellation energy ceo now exelon executive chairman mayo a shattuck iii makes a lot of money probably more than you i’m not saying he’s the richest person in baltimore but among the area’s public company ceos he was the highest paid last year — by far — with a gross income of  million if you figure in retirement benefits and stock awards according to a sun investigative report it’s easy to hate on this figure especially when you discover that constellation recorded  million in losses last year and when you divide it by  and realize the guy essentially makes  an hour that’s about  times the living wage in baltimore city and about  times minimum wage and this is right about where the occupy movement’s consensus on what’s wrong with the country ends — absurd income inequality so what do we do about it that’s where opinions really diverge certainly an easy — but maybe not very effective — option is to simply call out the most perversely wealthy among us and make some calculations with their salary to indulge in righteous anger and to some extent awe at the fantastic wealth a few individuals happen to command if you want to tinker around with some disturbing numbers while you figure out how to make capitalism work backwards visit the sun‘s interactive chart “executive compensation in maryland – ” and compare it to mit’s living wage calculator for
