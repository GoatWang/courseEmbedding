tens units from lgmedsupply lgmedsupply has a large selection of portable tens units for pain relief whether you�re looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body you will find that we offer the best tens machines and warranties tens units are often used as a noninvasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief a substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a tens unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers thus creating a pain relieving sensation ems units from lgmedsupply we also carry many ems units an ems unit also known as an electrical muscle stimulator electronic muscle stimulator electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator can be used as a therapy tool for patients a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction ems units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract electrical impulses generated by the ems machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions a large selection of tens ems combo units tens units and ems units work the same way an ems unit will stimulate muscles whereas a tens unit will stimulate nerve endings many pain sufferers use a combination of both tens and ems to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation we carry a large selection of portable combo tens  ems units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation portable ultrasound machines for the home from lgmedsupply we also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home these home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow they can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons andor ligaments without adding any stress all while softening scar tissue having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers longterm pain relief cost savings portable therapy and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation

traumatic brain injury mtbi has increased considerably during the last decade the majority of the research into mtbi has been directed toward the neuropsychological aspect of the injury and not until recently has focus been placed on the pathophysiology of mtbi in the sport arena systemic physiological effects of mtbi include altered hr variability and decreased baroreflex sensitivity cellular

identified faims technical overview breathtec biomedical aims to assist the development of novel instrumentation and methodologies for highfield asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry faims faims can be performed on a standalone device or more prominently coupled to a mass spectrometer ms faims is a separation technique which allows continuous sample introduction enabling direct realtime analysis faims or differential mobility spectrometry dms involves separation based on the inherent differences in an ion’s mobility in high and low electric fields and can be performed at atmospheric pressure and room temperature unlike its chromatographic counterparts in conventional ion mobility spectrometry ims ions are pulsed through a drift tube by an applied electric field in the presence of a buffer gas which opposes the ion’s motion as the field is held constant the velocity and therefore the mobility of an ion is dependent upon its mass charge size and shape as it traverses the drift tube and collides with the buffer gas molecules this is demonstrated by the following equation where ν is the velocity of the ion κ is the mobility of the ion and ε is the electric field strength therefore the migration time through the tube is characteristic of each ion however in faims the applied rf voltage is alternated between a high and low field as the ions are swept through the cell by a carrier gas as the electric field increases in intensity the velocity does not increase proportionally with the field strength thus mobility becomes fielddependent at higher electric fields at such higher fields above  vcm as opposed to the  vcm considered lowfield the mobility may now be expressed by the following equation where κh is the highfield mobility κ is the lowfield mobility α and ß are compound specific values which account for highfield mobility effect n is the gas number density of carrier gas and ε is the electric field strength this distinct difference in mobility between high and low fields κhκ is the basic operational principle of faims faims is typically performed by utilizing one of two cell geometries curved or planar to best illustrate the separation principles of faims a planar geometry cell is discussed however both geometries are fundamentally similar separation is achieved by maintaining one electrode at or near ground while applying a waveform to the other electrode as described by the application of a dispersion voltage to create a highfield environment for a short amount of time before applying the opposite polarity voltage to create a lowfield environment for a greater amount of time a while subjected to a high field an ion has a greater mobility causing it to drift faster toward the lower plate when the field is switched the ion’s mobility decreases and it drifts toward the upper plate due to the asymmetry of the waveform there will be a net displacement of the ion after one period of the waveform as the ion will not cover the same vertical distance when in lowfield as it did in highfield with each continuous period the ion will move closer and closer to one of the electrodes until it makes contact and is annihilated to compensate for this drift specific ions of interest can be made to reach the detector by applying a secondary dc voltage to the electrodes called the compensation voltage as seen in b figure a figure

propel innovative research in the area of breath analysis as a medical screening tool our efforts are aimed at leading the development of commercially viable methods for the early screening of diseases such as lung  breast cancers neurodegenerative diseases eg alzheimer’s  parkinson’s tuberculosis diabetes liver disease and more our primary avenue of investigation is focused on innovation and advances in the field of specialized mass spectrometry the principal market opportunity arises from the potential of lowcost nonintrusive diagnostic screening in general medical practice which could lead to notable advances in early detection of major cancers and other lifealtering diseases regular screening using a simple breath test could lead to significant advancements in remedial
