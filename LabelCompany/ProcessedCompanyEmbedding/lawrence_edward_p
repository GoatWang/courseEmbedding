follow any formal religion his father carl victor page sr earned a phd in computer science from the university of michigan in  when the field was being established and has been described by bbc reporter will smale as a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence he was a computer science professor at michigan state university and pages mother gloria was an instructor in computer programming at lyman briggs college and at michigan state university during an interview page recalled his childhood noting that his house was usually a mess with computers science and technology magazines and popular science magazines all over the place an environment in which he immersed himself page was an avid reader during his youth writing in his  google founders letter that i remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines according to writer nicholas carlson the combined influence of pages home atmosphere and his attentive parents fostered creativity and invention page also played saxophone and studied music composition while growing up page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing in some sense i feel like music training led to the highspeed legacy of google for me in an interview page said that in music you’re very cognizant of time time is like the primary thing and that if you think about it from a music point of view if you’re a percussionist you hit something it’s got to happen in milliseconds fractions of a second page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old as he was able to play with the stuff lying around—firstgeneration personal computers—that had been left by his parents he became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked he said that from a very early age i also realized i wanted to invent things so i became really interested in technology and business probably from when i was  i knew i was going to start a company eventually page attended the okemos montessori school now called montessori radmoor in okemos michigan from  to  and graduated from east lansing high school in  he attended interlochen center for the arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school page holds a bachelor of science in computer engineering from the university of michigan with honors and a master of science in computer science from stanford university while at the university of michigan page created an inkjet printer made of lego bricks literally a line plotter after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—page reverseengineered the ink cartridge and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it page served as the president of the beta epsilon chapter of the eta kappa nu fraternity and was a member of the  maize  blue university of michigan solar car team as an undergrad at the university of michigan he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a prt system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger he also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time phd studies and researchedit after enrolling in a computer science phd program at stanford university page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the world wide web understanding its link structure as a huge graph—his supervisor terry winograd encouraged him to pursue the idea and page recalled in  that it was the best advice he had ever received he also considered doing research on telepresence and autonomous cars during this time page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research sergey brin a fellow stanford phd student would soon join pages research project nicknamed backrub together the pair authored a research paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time john battelle cofounder of wired magazine wrote that page had reasoned that the  entire web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all what is a link but a citation if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web as page puts it the web would become a more valuable place battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project at the time page conceived of backrub the web comprised an estimated  million documents with an untold number of links between them the computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project unaware of exactly what he was getting into page began building out his crawler the ideas complexity and scale lured brin to the job a polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic he found the premise behind backrub fascinating i talked to lots of research groups around the school brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the web which represents human knowledge and because i liked larry search engine developmentedit to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users page and sergey brin by graziano origa by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august   total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information googleedit page in the early days of google –edit foundingedit mark malseed wrote in a  feature story soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park  soon after sun microsystems cofounder andy bechtolsheim wrote a  check to google inc the only problem was google inc did not yet exist—the company hadnt yet been incorporated for two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money in  brin and page incorporated google inc with the initial domain name of googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore following inception page appointed himself as ceo while brin named googles cofounder served as googles president writer nicholas carlson wrote in  while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—sergey and larry larry and sergey—the truth is that google is a creation of larry page helped along by sergey brin the pairs mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful with a usmillion loan from friends and family the inaugural team eventually moved into a mountain view office by the start of  in  page experimented with smaller sized server units so that google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses that the company rented to store their servers which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than googles competitors at the time by june  google had indexed one billion internet urls or uniform resource locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time the company cited nec research institute data in its june  press release stating that there are more than  billion web pages online today with google providing access to  million fulltext indexed web pages and  million partially indexed urls early management styleedit during his first tenure as ceo page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of googles project managers in  pages plan involved all of google’s engineers reporting to a vp of engineering who would then report directly to him—page explained that he didn’t like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference dont delegate do everything you can yourself to make things go faster dont get in the way if youre not adding value let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else dont be a bureaucrat ideas are more important than age just because someone is junior doesnt mean they dont deserve respect and cooperation the worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying no period if you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done even though pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction more broadly eventually the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley page also believed that the faster google’s search engine returned answers the more it would be used he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times he also pushed for keeping google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster –edit changes in management and expansionedit before silicon valleys two most prominent investors kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital agreed to invest a combined total of  million into google they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos including steve jobs and intel’s andrew grove eric schmidt who had been hired as chairman of google in march  left his fulltime position as the ceo of novell to take on the same role at google in august of the same year and page moved aside to assume the president of products role under schmidts leadership google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering ipo on august   however he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system furthermore page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty page led the acquisition of android for  million in  to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google from anywhere the purchase was made without schmidts knowledge but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition page became passionate about android and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin by september  tmobile launched the g the first phone using android software and by   percent of the handset market consisted of android sales overtaking apple for the first time android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward assumption of ceo position at googleedit following a january  announcement page officially became the chief executive of google on april   while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman by this time google had over  billion market capitalization and more than  employees after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january   he jokingly tweeted on twitter adultsupervision no longer needed quartz organizational management reporter max nisen described the decade prior to pages second appointment as googles ceo as his lost decade while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time overseeing product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time –edit as googles new ceo pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams page also formed what the media called the lteam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week additionally he reorganized the company’s senior management placing a ceolike manager at the top of googles most important product divisions including youtube adwords and google search in accordance with a more cohesive team environment page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic as part of pages collaborative rejuvenation process googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul changes and consolidation processedit at least  of googles products features and services were eventually shut down by march  while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified jon wiley lead designer of google search at the time codenamed pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on april   project kennedy based on pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a january  wired interview an initiative named kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change matias duarte senior director of the android user experience at the time that kennedy started explained in  that google passionately cares about design page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team based in new york city to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of google might look like the eventual results of kennedy which were progressively rolled out from june  until january  were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity the final products were aligned with pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and kennedy was called a design revolution by duarte pages uxa usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users unspoken of in public the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that kennedy became an institution acquisition strategy and new productsedit when acquiring products and companies for google page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better this approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes with facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with googles own social network google in mid after several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra googles then senior vice president of social in august  page announced that google would spend  billion to acquire motorola mobility the purchase was primarily motivated by googles need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc page wrote on googles official blog on august   that companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on android the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google’s patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect android from anticompetitive threats from microsoft apple and other companies page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may  the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system chrome os –edit in january  page participated in a rare interview with wired in which writer steven levy discussed pages x mentality—google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least  times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb astro teller the head of google x explained to levy that x is just core to who he page is while pages focus is on where the next x will come from in his interview with levy page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying if you’re not doing some things that are crazy then you’re doing the wrong things page also stated that he was very happy with the status of google and discussed concerns over the internet in relation to the sopa bill and an international telecommunication union proposal that had been recently introduced  i do think the internet’s under much greater attack than it has been in the past governments are now afraid of the internet because of the middle east stuff and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what i see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms but they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction like the backlash against sopa i think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril at the may  io developers conference in san francisco page delivered a keynote address and said that were at maybe  of what is possible despite the faster change were still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have i think a lot of that is because of the negativity every story i read is google vs someone else thats boring we should be focusing on building the things that dont exist and that he was sad the web isnt advancing as fast as it should be citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that in response to an audience question page noted an issue that google had been experiencing with microsoft whereby the latter made its outlook program interoperable with google but did not allow for backward compatibility—he referred to microsofts practice as milking off during the questionandanswer section of his keynote page expressed interest in burning man which brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during schmidts hiring process as brin liked that schmidt had attended the weeklong annual event in september  page launched the independent calico initiative a rd project in the field of biotechnology google announced that calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health and appointed art levinson chairman of apples board and former ceo of genentech to be the new divisions ceo pages official statement read illness and aging affect all our families with some longer term moonshot

pages chief pr executive rachel whetstone and google’s cmo lorraine twohill and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen page responded to a question about corporations noting that corporations largely get a bad rap which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing  or  years ago he went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate page mentioned elon musk and spacex he musk wants to go to mars to back up humanity that’s a worthy goal we have a lot of employees at google who’ve become pretty wealthy you’re working because you want to change the world and make it better  i’d like for us to help out more than we are page also mentioned nikola tesla with regard to invention and commercialization invention is not enough tesla invented the electric power we use but he struggled to get it out to people you have to combine both things invention and innovation focus plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people page announced a major management restructure in october  so that he would no longer need to be responsible for daytoday productrelated decision making in a memo page said that googles core businesses would be able to progress in a

pushing people ahead alphabetedit on august   page announced on googles official blog that google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as alphabet inc with page becoming ceo of alphabet inc and sundar pichai assuming the position of ceo of google inc in his announcement page described the planned holding company as follows “ alphabet is mostly a collection of companies the largest of which of course is google this newer google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in alphabet instead  fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that aren’t very related ” as well as explaining the origin of the companys name “ we liked the name alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanitys most important innovations and is the core of how we index with google search we also like that it means alpha‑bet alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for ” page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make google cleaner and more accountable he also

mother was jewish and his grandfather later made aliyah to israel although page does not follow any formal religion his father carl victor page sr earned a phd in computer science from the university of michigan in  when the field was being established and has been described by bbc reporter will smale as a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence he was a computer science professor at michigan state university and pages mother gloria was an instructor in computer programming at lyman briggs college and at michigan state university during an interview page recalled his childhood noting that his house was usually a mess with computers science and technology magazines and popular science magazines all over the place an environment in which he immersed himself page was an avid reader during his youth writing in his  google founders letter that i remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines according to writer nicholas carlson the combined influence of pages home atmosphere and his attentive parents fostered creativity and invention page also played saxophone and studied music composition while growing up page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing in some sense i feel like music training led to the highspeed legacy of google for me in an interview page said that in music you’re very cognizant of time time is like the primary thing and that if you think about it from a music point of view if you’re a percussionist you hit something it’s got to happen in milliseconds fractions of a second page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old as he was able to play with the stuff lying around—firstgeneration personal computers—that had been left by his parents he became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked he said that from a very early age i also realized i wanted to invent things so i became really interested in technology and business probably from when i was  i knew i was going to start a company eventually page attended the okemos montessori school now called montessori radmoor in okemos michigan from  to  and graduated from east lansing high school in  he attended interlochen center for the arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school page holds a bachelor of science in computer engineering from the university of michigan with honors and a master of science in computer science from stanford university while at the university of michigan page created an inkjet printer made of lego bricks literally a line plotter after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—page reverseengineered the ink cartridge and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it page served as the president of the beta epsilon chapter of the eta kappa nu fraternity and was a member of the  maize  blue university of michigan solar car team as an undergrad at the university of michigan he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a prt system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger he also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time phd studies and researchedit after enrolling in a computer science phd program at stanford university page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the world wide web understanding its link structure as a huge graph—his supervisor terry winograd encouraged him to pursue the idea and page recalled in  that it was the best advice he had ever received he also considered doing research on telepresence and autonomous cars during this time page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research sergey brin a fellow stanford phd student would soon join pages research project nicknamed backrub together the pair authored a research paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time john battelle cofounder of wired magazine wrote that page had reasoned that the  entire web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all what is a link but a citation if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web as page puts it the web would become a more valuable place battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project at the time page conceived of backrub the web comprised an estimated  million documents with an untold number of links between them the computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project unaware of exactly what he was getting into page began building out his crawler the ideas complexity and scale lured brin to the job a polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic he found the premise behind backrub fascinating i talked to lots of research groups around the school brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the web which represents human knowledge and because i liked larry search engine developmentedit to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users page and sergey brin by graziano origa by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august   total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information googleedit page in the early days of google –edit foundingedit mark malseed wrote in a  feature story soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park  soon after sun microsystems cofounder andy bechtolsheim wrote a  check to google inc the only problem was google inc did not yet exist—the company hadnt yet been incorporated for two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money in  brin and page incorporated google inc with the initial domain name of googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore following inception page appointed himself as ceo while brin named googles cofounder served as googles president writer nicholas carlson wrote in  while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—sergey and larry larry and sergey—the truth is that google is a creation of larry page helped along by sergey brin the pairs mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful with a usmillion loan from friends and family the inaugural team eventually moved into a mountain view office by the start of  in  page experimented with smaller sized server units so that google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses that the company rented to store their servers which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than googles competitors at the time by june  google had indexed one billion internet urls or uniform resource locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time the company cited nec research institute data in its june  press release stating that there are more than  billion web pages online today with google providing access to  million fulltext indexed web pages and  million partially indexed urls early management styleedit during his first tenure as ceo page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of googles project managers in  pages plan involved all of google’s engineers reporting to a vp of engineering who would then report directly to him—page explained that he didn’t like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference dont delegate do everything you can yourself to make things go faster dont get in the way if youre not adding value let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else dont be a bureaucrat ideas are more important than age just because someone is junior doesnt mean they dont deserve respect and cooperation the worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying no period if you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done even though pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction more broadly eventually the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley page also believed that the faster google’s search engine returned answers the more it would be used he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times he also pushed for keeping google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster –edit changes in management and expansionedit before silicon valleys two most prominent investors kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital agreed to invest a combined total of  million into google they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos including steve jobs and intel’s andrew grove eric schmidt who had been hired as chairman of google in march  left his fulltime position as the ceo of novell to take on the same role at google in august of the same year and page moved aside to assume the president of products role under schmidts leadership google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering ipo on august   however he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system furthermore page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty page led the acquisition of android for  million in  to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google from anywhere the purchase was made without schmidts knowledge but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition page became passionate about android and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin by september  tmobile launched the g the first phone using android software and by   percent of the handset market consisted of android sales overtaking apple for the first time android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward assumption of ceo position at googleedit following a january  announcement page officially became the chief executive of google on april   while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman by this time google had over  billion market capitalization and more than  employees after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january   he jokingly tweeted on twitter adultsupervision no longer needed quartz organizational management reporter max nisen described the decade prior to pages second appointment as googles ceo as his lost decade while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time overseeing product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time –edit as googles new ceo pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams page also formed what the media called the lteam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week additionally he reorganized the company’s senior management placing a ceolike manager at the top of googles most important product divisions including youtube adwords and google search in accordance with a more cohesive team environment page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic as part of pages collaborative rejuvenation process googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul changes and consolidation processedit at least  of googles products features and services were eventually shut down by march  while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified jon wiley lead designer of google search at the time codenamed pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on april   project kennedy based on pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a january  wired interview an initiative named kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change matias duarte senior director of the android user experience at the time that kennedy started explained in  that google passionately cares about design page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team based in new york city to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of google might look like the eventual results of kennedy which were progressively rolled out from june  until january  were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity the final products were aligned with pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and kennedy was called a design revolution by duarte pages uxa usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users unspoken of in public the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that kennedy became an institution acquisition strategy and new productsedit when acquiring products and companies for google page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better this approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes with facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with googles own social network google in mid after several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra googles then senior vice president of social in august  page announced that google would spend  billion to acquire motorola mobility the purchase was primarily motivated by googles need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc page wrote on googles official blog on august   that companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on android the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google’s patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect android from anticompetitive threats from microsoft apple and other companies page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may  the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system chrome os –edit in january  page participated in a rare interview with wired in which writer steven levy discussed pages x mentality—google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least  times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb astro teller the head of google x explained to levy that x is just core to who he page is while pages focus is on where the next x will come from in his interview with levy page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying if you’re not doing some things that are crazy then you’re doing the wrong things page also stated that he was very happy with the status of google and discussed concerns over the internet in relation to the sopa bill and an international telecommunication union proposal that had been recently introduced  i do think the internet’s under much greater attack than it has been in the past governments are now afraid of the internet because of the middle east stuff and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what i see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms but they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction like the

at michigan state university and pages mother gloria was an instructor in computer programming at lyman briggs college and at michigan state university during an interview page recalled his childhood noting that his house was usually a mess with computers science and technology magazines and popular science magazines all over the place an environment in which he immersed himself page was an avid reader during his youth writing in his  google founders letter that i remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines according to writer nicholas carlson the combined influence of pages home atmosphere and his attentive parents fostered creativity and invention page also played saxophone and studied music composition while growing up page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing in some sense i feel like music training led to the highspeed legacy of google for me in an interview page said that in music you’re very cognizant of time time is like the primary thing and that if you think about it from a music point of view if you’re a percussionist you hit something it’s got to happen in milliseconds fractions of a second page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old as he was able to play with the stuff lying around—firstgeneration personal computers—that had been left by his parents he became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked he said that from a very early age i also realized i wanted to invent things so i became really interested in technology and business probably from when i was  i knew i was going to start a company eventually page attended the okemos montessori school now called montessori radmoor in okemos michigan from  to  and graduated from east lansing high school in  he attended interlochen center for the arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school page holds a bachelor of science in computer engineering from the university of michigan with honors and a master of science in computer science from stanford university while at the university of michigan page created an inkjet printer made of lego bricks literally a line plotter after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—page reverseengineered the ink cartridge and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it page served as the president of the beta epsilon chapter of the eta kappa nu fraternity and was a member of the  maize  blue university of michigan solar car team as an undergrad at the university of michigan he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a prt system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger he also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time phd studies and researchedit after enrolling in a computer science phd program at stanford university page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the world wide web understanding its link structure as a huge graph—his supervisor terry winograd encouraged him to pursue the idea and page recalled in  that it was the best advice he had ever received he also considered doing research on telepresence and autonomous cars during this time page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research sergey brin a fellow stanford phd student would soon join pages research project nicknamed backrub together the pair authored a research paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time john battelle cofounder of wired magazine wrote that page had reasoned that the  entire web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all what is a link but a citation if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web as page puts it the web would become a more valuable place battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project at the time page conceived of backrub the web comprised an estimated  million documents with an untold number of links between them the computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project unaware of exactly what he was getting into page began building out his crawler the ideas complexity and scale lured brin to the job a polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic he found the premise behind backrub fascinating i talked to lots of research groups around the school brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the web which represents human knowledge and because i liked larry search engine developmentedit to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users page and sergey brin by graziano origa

several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information googleedit page in the early days of google –edit foundingedit mark malseed wrote in a  feature story soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park  soon after sun microsystems cofounder andy bechtolsheim wrote a  check to google inc the only problem was google inc did not yet exist—the company hadnt yet been incorporated for two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money in  brin and page incorporated google inc with the initial domain name of googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore following inception page appointed himself as ceo while brin named googles cofounder served as googles president writer nicholas carlson wrote in  while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—sergey and larry larry and sergey—the truth is that google is a creation of larry page helped along by sergey brin the pairs mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful with a usmillion loan from friends and family the inaugural team eventually moved into a mountain view office by the start of  in  page experimented with smaller sized server units so that google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses that the company rented to store their servers which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than googles competitors at the time by june  google had indexed one billion internet urls or uniform resource locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time the company cited nec research institute data in its june  press release stating that there are more than  billion web pages online today with google providing access to  million fulltext indexed web pages and  million partially indexed urls early management styleedit during his first tenure as ceo page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of googles project managers in  pages plan involved all of google’s engineers reporting to a vp of engineering who would then report directly to him—page explained that he didn’t like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference dont delegate do everything you can yourself to make things go faster dont get in the way if youre not adding value let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else dont be a bureaucrat ideas are more important than age just because someone is junior doesnt mean they dont deserve respect and cooperation the worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying no period if you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done even though pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction more broadly eventually the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley page also believed that the faster google’s search engine returned answers the more it would be used he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times he also pushed for keeping google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster –edit changes in management and expansionedit before silicon valleys two most prominent investors kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital agreed to invest a combined total of  million into google they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos including steve jobs and intel’s andrew grove eric schmidt who had been hired as chairman of google in march  left his fulltime position as the ceo of novell to take on the same role at google in august of the same year and page moved aside to assume the president of products role under schmidts leadership google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering ipo on august   however he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system furthermore page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty page led the acquisition of android for  million in  to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google from anywhere the purchase was made without schmidts knowledge but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition page became passionate about android and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin by september  tmobile launched the g the first phone using android software and by   percent of the handset market consisted of android sales overtaking apple for the first time android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward assumption of ceo position at googleedit following a january  announcement page officially became the chief executive of google on april   while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman by this time google had over  billion market capitalization and more than  employees after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january   he jokingly tweeted on twitter adultsupervision no longer needed quartz organizational management reporter max nisen described the decade prior to pages second appointment as googles ceo as his lost decade while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time overseeing product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time –edit as googles new ceo pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams page also formed what the media called the lteam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week additionally he reorganized the company’s senior management placing a ceolike manager at the top of googles most important product divisions including youtube adwords and google search in accordance with a more cohesive team environment page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic as part of pages collaborative rejuvenation process googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul changes and consolidation processedit at least  of googles products features and services were eventually shut down by march  while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified jon wiley lead designer of google search at the time codenamed pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on april   project kennedy based on pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a january  wired interview an initiative named kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change matias duarte senior director of the android user experience at the time that kennedy started explained in  that google passionately cares about design page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team based in new york city to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of google might look like the eventual results of kennedy which were progressively rolled out from june  until january  were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity the final products were aligned with pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and kennedy was called a design revolution by duarte pages uxa usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users unspoken of in public the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that kennedy became an institution acquisition strategy and new productsedit when acquiring products and companies for google page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better this approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes with facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with googles own social network google in mid after several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra googles then senior vice president of social in august  page announced that google would spend  billion to acquire motorola mobility the purchase was primarily motivated by googles need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc page wrote on googles official blog on august   that companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on android the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google’s patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect android from anticompetitive threats from microsoft apple and other companies page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may  the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system chrome os –edit in january  page participated in a rare interview with wired in which writer steven levy discussed pages x mentality—google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least  times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb astro teller the head of google x explained to levy that x is just core to who he page is while pages focus is on where the next x will come from in his interview with levy page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying if you’re not doing some things that are crazy then you’re doing the wrong things page also stated that he was very happy with the status of google and discussed concerns over the internet in relation to the sopa bill and an international telecommunication union proposal that had been recently introduced  i do think the internet’s under much greater attack than it has been in the past governments are now afraid of the internet because of the middle east stuff and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what i see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms but they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction like the backlash against sopa i think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril at the may  io developers conference in san francisco page delivered a keynote address and said that were at maybe  of what is possible despite the faster change were still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have i think a lot of that is because of the negativity every story i read is google vs someone else thats boring we should be focusing on building the things that dont exist and that he was sad the web isnt advancing as fast as it should be citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that in response to an audience question page noted an issue that google had been experiencing with microsoft whereby the latter made its outlook program interoperable with google but did not allow for backward compatibility—he referred to microsofts practice as milking off during the questionandanswer section of his keynote page expressed interest in burning man which brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during schmidts hiring process as brin liked that schmidt had attended the weeklong annual event in september  page launched the independent calico initiative a rd project in the field of biotechnology google announced that calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health and appointed art levinson chairman of apples board and former ceo of genentech to be the new divisions ceo pages official statement read illness and aging affect all our families with some longer term moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology i believe we can improve millions of lives page participated in a march  tedx conference that was held in vancouver canada the presentation was scripted by pages chief pr executive rachel whetstone and google’s cmo lorraine twohill and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen page responded to a question about corporations noting that corporations largely get a bad rap which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing  or  years ago he went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate page mentioned elon musk and spacex he musk wants to go to mars to back up humanity that’s a worthy goal we have a lot of employees at google who’ve become pretty wealthy you’re working because you want to change the world and make it better  i’d like for us to help out more than we are page also mentioned nikola tesla with regard to invention and commercialization invention is not enough tesla invented the electric power we use but he struggled to get it out to people you have to combine both things invention and innovation focus plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people page announced a major management restructure in october  so that he would no longer need to be responsible for daytoday productrelated decision making in a memo page said that googles core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects including google x initiatives access and energy including google fiber smarthome automation through nest labs and biotechnology innovations under calico page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial chief product officer subsequent to the announcement the executives in charge of googles core products reported to then google senior vice president sundar pichai who reported directly to page in a november  interview page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his deep knowledge of googles products and breadth of projects as it had been a key motivating factor for team members in relation to his then role as the companys ceo page said i think my job as ceo—i feel like it’s always to be pushing people ahead alphabetedit on august   page announced on googles official blog that google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as alphabet inc with page becoming ceo of alphabet inc and sundar pichai assuming the position of ceo of google inc in his announcement page described the planned holding company as follows “ alphabet is mostly a collection of companies the largest of which of course is google this newer google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in alphabet instead  fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that aren’t very related ” as well as explaining the origin of the companys name “ we liked the name alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanitys most important innovations and is the core of how we index with google search we also like that it means alpha‑bet alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for ” page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make google cleaner and more accountable he also wrote that there was a desire to improve the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within

mother was jewish and his grandfather later made aliyah to israel although page does not follow any formal religion his father carl victor page sr earned a phd in computer science from the university of michigan in  when the field was being established and has been described by bbc reporter will smale as a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence he was a computer science professor at michigan state university and pages mother gloria was an instructor in computer programming at lyman briggs college and at michigan state university during an interview page recalled his childhood noting that his house was usually a mess with computers science and technology magazines and popular science magazines all over the place an environment in which he immersed himself page was an avid reader during his youth writing in his  google founders letter that i remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines according to writer nicholas carlson the combined influence of pages home atmosphere and his attentive parents fostered creativity and invention page also played saxophone and studied music composition while growing up page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing in some sense i feel like music training led to the highspeed legacy of google for me in an interview page said that in music you’re very cognizant of time time is like the primary thing and that if you think about it from a music point of view if you’re a percussionist you hit something it’s got to happen in milliseconds fractions of a second page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old as he was able to play with the stuff lying around—firstgeneration personal computers—that had been left by his parents he became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked he said that from a very early age i also realized i wanted to invent things so i became really interested in technology and business probably from when i was  i knew i was going to start a company eventually page attended the okemos montessori school now called montessori radmoor in okemos michigan from  to  and graduated from east lansing high school in  he attended interlochen center for the arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school page holds a bachelor of science in computer engineering from the university of michigan with honors and a master of science in computer science from stanford university while at the university of michigan page created an inkjet printer made of lego bricks literally a line plotter after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—page reverseengineered the ink cartridge and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it page served as the president of the beta epsilon chapter of the eta kappa nu fraternity and was a member of the  maize  blue university of michigan solar car team as an undergrad at the university of michigan he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a prt system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger he also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time phd studies and researchedit after enrolling in a computer science phd program at stanford university page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the world wide web understanding its link structure as a huge graph—his supervisor terry winograd encouraged him to pursue the idea and page recalled in  that it was the best advice he had ever received he also considered doing research on telepresence and autonomous cars during this time page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research sergey brin a fellow stanford phd student would soon join pages research project nicknamed backrub together the pair authored a research paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time john battelle cofounder of wired magazine wrote that page had reasoned that the  entire web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all what is a link but a citation if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web as page puts it the web would become a more valuable place battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project at the time page conceived of backrub the web comprised an estimated  million documents with an untold number of links between them the computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project unaware of exactly what he was getting into page began building out his crawler the ideas complexity and scale lured brin to the job a polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic he found the premise behind backrub fascinating i talked to lots of research groups around the school brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the web which represents human knowledge and because i liked larry search engine developmentedit to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users page and sergey brin by graziano origa by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august   total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information googleedit page in the early days of google –edit foundingedit mark malseed wrote in a  feature story soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park  soon after sun microsystems cofounder andy bechtolsheim wrote a  check to google inc the only problem was google inc did not yet exist—the company hadnt yet been incorporated for two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money in  brin and page incorporated google inc with the initial domain name of googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore following inception page appointed himself as ceo while brin named googles cofounder served as googles president writer nicholas carlson wrote in  while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—sergey and larry larry and sergey—the truth is that google is a creation of larry page helped along by sergey brin the pairs mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful with a usmillion loan from friends and family the inaugural team eventually moved into a mountain view office by the start of  in  page experimented with smaller sized server units so that google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses that the company rented to store their servers which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than googles competitors at the time by june  google had indexed one billion internet urls or uniform resource locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time the company cited nec research institute data in its june  press release stating that there are more than  billion web pages online today with google providing access to  million fulltext indexed web pages and  million partially indexed urls early management styleedit during his first tenure as ceo page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of googles project managers in  pages plan involved all of google’s engineers reporting to a vp of engineering who would then report directly to him—page explained that he didn’t like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference dont delegate do everything you can yourself to make things go faster dont get in the way if youre not adding value let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else dont be a bureaucrat ideas are more important than age just because someone is junior doesnt mean they dont deserve respect and cooperation the worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying no period if you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done even though pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction more broadly eventually the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley page also believed that the faster google’s search engine returned answers the more it would be used he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times he also pushed for keeping google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster –edit changes in management and expansionedit before silicon valleys two most prominent investors kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital agreed to invest a combined total of  million into google they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos including steve jobs and intel’s andrew grove eric schmidt who had been hired as chairman of google in march  left his fulltime position as the ceo of novell to take on the same role at google in august of the same year and page moved aside to assume the president of products role under schmidts leadership google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering ipo on august   however he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system furthermore page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty page led the acquisition of android for  million in  to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google from anywhere the purchase was made without schmidts knowledge but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition page became passionate about android and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin by september  tmobile launched the g the first phone using android software and by   percent of the handset market consisted of android sales overtaking apple for the first time android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward assumption of ceo position at googleedit following a january  announcement page officially became the chief executive of google on april   while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman by this time google had over  billion market capitalization and more than  employees after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january   he jokingly tweeted on twitter adultsupervision no longer needed quartz organizational management reporter max nisen described the decade prior to pages second appointment as googles ceo as his lost decade while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time overseeing product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time –edit as googles new ceo pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams page also formed what the media called the lteam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week additionally he reorganized the company’s senior management placing a ceolike manager at the top of googles most important product divisions including youtube adwords and google search in accordance with a more cohesive team environment page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic as part of pages collaborative rejuvenation process googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul changes and consolidation processedit at least  of googles products features and services were eventually shut down by march  while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified jon wiley lead designer of google search at the time codenamed pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on april   project kennedy based on pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a january  wired interview an initiative named kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change matias duarte senior director of the android user experience at the time that kennedy started explained in  that google passionately cares about design page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team based in new york city to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of google might look like the eventual results of kennedy which were progressively rolled out from june  until january  were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity the final products were aligned with pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and kennedy was called a design revolution by duarte pages uxa usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users unspoken of in public the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that kennedy became an institution acquisition strategy and new productsedit when acquiring products and companies for google page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better this approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes with facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with googles own social network google in mid after several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra googles then senior vice president of social in august  page announced that google would spend  billion to acquire motorola mobility the purchase was primarily motivated by googles need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc page wrote on googles official blog on august   that companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on android the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google’s patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect android from anticompetitive threats from microsoft apple and other companies page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may  the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system chrome os –edit in january  page participated in a rare interview with wired in which writer steven levy discussed pages x mentality—google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least  times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb astro teller the head of google x explained to levy that x is just core to who he page is while pages focus is on where the next x will come from in his interview with levy page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying if you’re not doing some things that are crazy then you’re doing the wrong things page also stated that he was very happy with the status of google and discussed concerns over the internet in relation to the sopa bill and an international telecommunication union proposal that had been recently introduced  i do think the internet’s under much greater attack than it has been in the past governments are now afraid of the internet because of the middle east stuff and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what i see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms but they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction like the backlash against sopa i think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril at the may  io developers conference in san francisco page delivered a keynote address and said that were at maybe  of what is possible despite the faster change were still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have i think a lot of that is because of the negativity every story i read is google vs someone else thats boring we should be focusing on building the things that dont exist and that he was sad the web isnt advancing as fast as it should be citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that in response to an audience question page noted an issue that google had been experiencing with microsoft whereby the latter made its outlook program interoperable with google but did not allow for backward compatibility—he referred to microsofts practice as milking off during the questionandanswer section of his keynote page expressed interest in burning man which brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during schmidts hiring process as brin liked that schmidt had attended the weeklong annual event in september  page launched the independent calico initiative a rd project in the field of biotechnology google announced that calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health and appointed art levinson chairman of apples board and former ceo of genentech to be the new divisions ceo pages official statement read illness and aging affect all our families with some longer term moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology i believe we can improve millions of lives page participated in a march  tedx conference that was held in vancouver canada the presentation was scripted by pages chief pr executive rachel whetstone and google’s cmo lorraine twohill and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen page responded to a question about corporations noting that corporations largely get a bad rap which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing  or  years ago he went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate page mentioned elon musk and spacex he musk wants to go to mars to back up humanity that’s a worthy goal we have a lot of employees at google who’ve become pretty wealthy you’re working because you want to change the world and make it better  i’d like for us to help out more than we are page also mentioned nikola tesla with regard to invention and commercialization invention is not enough tesla invented the electric power we use but he struggled to get it out to people you have to combine both things invention and innovation focus plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people page announced a major management restructure in october  so that he would no longer need to be responsible for daytoday productrelated decision making in a memo page said that googles core businesses

ceo—i feel like it’s always to be pushing people ahead alphabetedit on august   page announced on googles official blog that google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as alphabet inc with page becoming ceo of alphabet inc and sundar pichai assuming the position of ceo of google inc in his announcement page described the planned holding company as follows “ alphabet is mostly a collection of companies the largest of which of course is google this newer google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in alphabet instead  fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that aren’t very related ” as well as explaining the origin of the companys name “ we liked the name alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanitys most important innovations and is the core of how we index with google search we also like that it means alpha‑bet alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for ” page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make google cleaner and more accountable he also wrote that there was a desire to improve the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within

mother was jewish and his grandfather later made aliyah to israel although page does not follow any formal religion his father carl victor page sr earned a phd in computer science from the university of michigan in  when the field was being established and has been described by bbc reporter will smale as a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence he was a computer science professor at michigan state university and pages mother gloria was an instructor in computer programming at lyman briggs college and at michigan state university during an interview page recalled his childhood noting that his house was usually a mess with computers science and technology magazines and popular science magazines all over the place an environment in which he immersed himself page was an avid reader during his youth writing in his  google founders letter that i remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines according to writer nicholas carlson the combined influence of pages home atmosphere and his attentive parents fostered creativity and invention page also played saxophone and studied music composition while growing up page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing in some sense i feel like music training led to the highspeed legacy of google for me in an interview page said that in music you’re very cognizant of time time is like the primary thing and that if you think about it from a music point of view if you’re a percussionist you hit something it’s got to happen in milliseconds fractions of a second page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old as he was able to play with the stuff lying around—firstgeneration personal computers—that had been left by his parents he became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked he said that from a very early age i also realized i wanted to invent things so i became really interested in technology and business probably from when i was  i knew i was going to start a company eventually page attended the okemos montessori school now called montessori radmoor in okemos michigan from  to  and graduated from east lansing high school in  he attended interlochen center for the arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school page holds a bachelor of science in computer engineering from the university of michigan with honors and a master of science in computer science from stanford university while at the university of michigan page created an inkjet printer made of lego bricks literally a line plotter after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges—page reverseengineered the ink cartridge and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it page served as the president of the beta epsilon chapter of the eta kappa nu fraternity and was a member of the  maize  blue university of michigan solar car team as an undergrad at the university of michigan he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a prt system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger he also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time phd studies and researchedit after enrolling in a computer science phd program at stanford university page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the world wide web understanding its link structure as a huge graph—his supervisor terry winograd encouraged him to pursue the idea and page recalled in  that it was the best advice he had ever received he also considered doing research on telepresence and autonomous cars during this time page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research sergey brin a fellow stanford phd student would soon join pages research project nicknamed backrub together the pair authored a research paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time john battelle cofounder of wired magazine wrote that page had reasoned that the  entire web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all what is a link but a citation if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web as page puts it the web would become a more valuable place battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project at the time page conceived of backrub the web comprised an estimated  million documents with an untold number of links between them the computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project unaware of exactly what he was getting into page began building out his crawler the ideas complexity and scale lured brin to the job a polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic he found the premise behind backrub fascinating i talked to lots of research groups around the school brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the web which represents human knowledge and because i liked larry search engine developmentedit to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users page and sergey brin by graziano origa by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august   total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information googleedit page in the early days of google –edit foundingedit mark malseed wrote in a  feature story soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park  soon after sun microsystems cofounder andy bechtolsheim wrote a  check to google inc the only problem was google inc did not yet exist—the company hadnt yet been incorporated for two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money in  brin and page incorporated google inc with the initial domain name of googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore following inception page appointed himself as ceo while brin named googles cofounder served as googles president writer nicholas carlson wrote in  while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—sergey and larry larry and sergey—the truth is that google is a creation of larry page helped along by sergey brin the pairs mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful with a usmillion loan from friends and family the inaugural team eventually moved into a mountain view office by the start of  in  page experimented with smaller sized server units so that google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses that the company rented to store their servers which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than googles competitors at the time by june  google had indexed one billion internet urls or uniform resource locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time the company cited nec research institute data in its june  press release stating that there are more than  billion web pages online today with google providing access to  million fulltext indexed web pages and  million partially indexed urls early management styleedit during his first tenure as ceo page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of googles project managers in  pages plan involved all of google’s engineers reporting to a vp of engineering who would then report directly to him—page explained that he didn’t like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference dont delegate do everything you can yourself to make things go faster dont get in the way if youre not adding value let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else dont be a bureaucrat ideas are more important than age just because someone is junior doesnt mean they dont deserve respect and cooperation the worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying no period if you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done even though pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction more broadly eventually the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley page also believed that the faster google’s search engine returned answers the more it would be used he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times he also pushed for keeping google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster –edit changes in management and expansionedit before silicon valleys two most prominent investors kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital agreed to invest a combined total of  million into google they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos including steve jobs and intel’s andrew grove eric schmidt who had been hired as chairman of google in march  left his fulltime position as the ceo of novell to take on the same role at google in august of the same year and page moved aside to assume the president of products role under schmidts leadership google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering ipo on august   however he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system furthermore page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty page led the acquisition of android for  million in  to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google from anywhere the purchase was made without schmidts knowledge but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition page became passionate about android and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin by september  tmobile launched the g the first phone using android software and by   percent of the handset market consisted of android sales overtaking apple for the first time android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward assumption of ceo position at googleedit following a january  announcement page officially became the chief executive of google on april   while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman by this time google had over  billion market capitalization and more than  employees after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january   he jokingly tweeted on twitter adultsupervision no longer needed quartz organizational management reporter max nisen described the decade prior to pages second appointment as googles ceo as his lost decade while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time overseeing product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time –edit as googles new ceo pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams page also formed what the media called the lteam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week additionally he reorganized the company’s senior management placing a ceolike manager at the top of googles most important product divisions including youtube adwords and google search in accordance with a more cohesive team environment page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic as part of pages collaborative rejuvenation process googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul changes and consolidation processedit at least  of googles products features and services were eventually shut down by march  while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified jon wiley lead designer of google search at the time codenamed pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on april   project kennedy based on pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a january  wired interview an initiative named kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change matias duarte senior director of the android user experience at the time that kennedy started explained in  that google passionately cares about design page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team based in new york city to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of google might look like the eventual results of kennedy which were progressively rolled out from june  until january  were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity the final products were aligned with pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and kennedy was called a design revolution by duarte pages uxa usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users unspoken of in public the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that kennedy became an institution acquisition strategy and new productsedit when acquiring products and companies for google page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better this approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes with facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with googles own social network google in mid after several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra googles then senior vice president of social in august  page announced that google would spend  billion to acquire motorola mobility the purchase was primarily motivated by googles need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc page wrote on googles official blog on august   that companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on android the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google’s patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect android from anticompetitive threats from microsoft apple and other companies page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may  the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system chrome os –edit in january  page participated in a rare interview with wired in which writer steven levy discussed pages x mentality—google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least  times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb astro teller the head of google x explained to levy that x is just core to who he page is while pages focus is on where the next x will come from in his interview with levy page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying if you’re not doing some things that are crazy then you’re doing the wrong things page

left by his parents he became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked he said that from a very early age i also realized i wanted to invent things so i became really interested in technology and business probably from

finding out which web pages link to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research sergey brin a fellow stanford phd student would soon join pages research project nicknamed backrub together the pair authored a research paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time john battelle cofounder of wired magazine wrote that page had reasoned that the  entire web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all what is a link but a citation if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web as page puts it the web would become a more valuable place battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project at the time page conceived of backrub the web comprised an estimated  million documents with an untold number of links between them the computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project unaware of

topic he found the premise behind backrub fascinating i talked to lots of research groups around the school brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the web which represents human knowledge and because i liked larry search engine developmentedit to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august  the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users page and sergey brin by graziano origa by early  the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august   total indexable html urls  million total content downloaded  gigabytes  backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks  larry page pagecsstanfordedu backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages page said that in mid they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had  searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in  johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information googleedit page in the early days of google –edit foundingedit mark malseed wrote in a  feature story soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park  soon after sun microsystems cofounder andy bechtolsheim wrote a  check to google inc the only problem was google inc did not yet exist—the company hadnt yet been incorporated for two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money in  brin and page incorporated google inc with the initial domain name of googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore following inception page appointed himself as ceo while brin named googles cofounder served as googles president writer nicholas carlson wrote in  while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—sergey and larry larry and sergey—the truth is that google is a creation of larry page helped along by sergey brin the pairs mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful with a usmillion loan from friends and family the inaugural team eventually moved into a mountain view office by the start of  in  page experimented with smaller sized server units so that google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses that the company rented to store their servers which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than googles competitors at the time by june  google had indexed one billion internet urls or uniform resource locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time the company cited nec research institute data in its june  press release stating that there are more than  billion web pages online today with google providing access to  million fulltext indexed web pages and  million partially indexed urls early management styleedit during his first tenure as ceo page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of googles project managers in  pages plan involved all of google’s engineers reporting to a vp of engineering who would then report directly to him—page explained that he didn’t like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference dont delegate do everything you can yourself to make things go faster dont get in the way if youre not adding value let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else dont be a bureaucrat ideas are more important than age just because someone is junior doesnt mean they dont deserve respect and cooperation the worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying no period if you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done even though pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction more broadly eventually the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley page also believed that the faster google’s search engine returned answers the more it would be used he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers—from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers—to think about lag times he also pushed for keeping google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster –edit changes in management and expansionedit before silicon valleys two most prominent investors kleiner perkins caufield  byers and sequoia capital agreed to invest a combined total of  million into google they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos including steve jobs and intel’s andrew grove eric schmidt who had been hired as chairman of google in march  left his fulltime position as the ceo of novell to take on the same role at google in august of the same year and page moved aside to assume the president of products role under schmidts leadership google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering ipo on august   however he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system furthermore page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty page led the acquisition of android for  million in  to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google from anywhere the purchase was made without schmidts knowledge but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition page became passionate about android and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin by september  tmobile launched the g the first phone using android software and by   percent of the handset market consisted of android sales overtaking apple for the first time android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward assumption of ceo position at googleedit following a january  announcement page officially became the chief executive of google on april   while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman by this time google had over  billion market capitalization and more than  employees after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january   he jokingly tweeted on twitter adultsupervision no longer needed quartz organizational management reporter max nisen described the decade prior to pages second appointment as googles ceo as his lost decade while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time overseeing product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time –edit as googles new ceo pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams page also formed what the media called the lteam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week additionally he reorganized the company’s senior management placing a ceolike manager at the top of googles most important product divisions including youtube adwords and google search in accordance with a more cohesive team environment page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic as part of pages collaborative rejuvenation process googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul changes and consolidation processedit at least  of googles products features and services were eventually shut down by march  while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified jon wiley lead designer of google search at the time codenamed pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on april   project kennedy based on pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a january  wired interview an initiative named kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change matias duarte senior director of the android user experience at the time that kennedy started explained in  that google passionately cares about design page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team based in new york city to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of google might look like the eventual results of kennedy which were progressively rolled out from june  until january  were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity the final products were aligned with pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and kennedy was called a design revolution by duarte pages uxa usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users unspoken of in public the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that kennedy became an institution acquisition strategy and new productsedit when acquiring products and companies for google page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better this approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes with facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with googles own social network google in mid after several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra googles then senior vice president of social in august  page announced that google would spend  billion to acquire motorola mobility the purchase was primarily motivated by googles need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc page wrote on googles official blog on august   that companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on android the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google’s patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect android from anticompetitive threats from microsoft apple and other companies page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may  the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system chrome os –edit in january  page participated in a rare interview with wired in which writer steven levy discussed pages x mentality—google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least  times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory blurb astro teller the head of google x explained to levy that x is just core to who he page is while pages focus is on where the next x will come from in his interview with levy page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying if you’re not doing some things that are crazy then you’re doing the wrong things page also stated that he was very happy with the status of google and discussed concerns over the internet in relation to the sopa bill and an international telecommunication union proposal that had been recently introduced  i do think the internet’s under much greater attack than it has been in the past governments are now afraid of the internet because of the middle east stuff and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what i see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms but they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction like the backlash against sopa i think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril at the may  io developers conference in san francisco page delivered a keynote address and said that were at maybe  of what is possible despite the faster change were still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have i think a lot of that is because of the negativity every story i read is google vs someone else thats boring we should be focusing on building the things that dont exist and that he was sad the web isnt advancing as fast as it should be citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that in response to an audience question page noted an issue that google had been experiencing with microsoft whereby the latter made its outlook program interoperable with google but did not allow for backward compatibility—he referred to microsofts practice as milking off during the questionandanswer section of his keynote page expressed interest in burning man which brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during schmidts hiring process as brin liked that schmidt had attended the weeklong annual event in september  page launched the independent calico initiative a rd project in the field of biotechnology google announced that calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health and appointed art levinson chairman of apples board and former ceo of genentech to be the new divisions ceo pages official statement read illness and aging affect all our families with some longer term moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology i believe we can improve millions of lives page participated in a march  tedx conference that was held in vancouver canada the presentation was scripted by pages chief pr executive rachel whetstone and google’s cmo lorraine twohill and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen page responded to a question about corporations noting that corporations largely get a bad rap which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing  or  years ago he went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate page mentioned elon musk and spacex he musk wants to go to mars to back up humanity that’s a worthy goal we have a lot of employees at google who’ve become pretty wealthy you’re working because you want to change the world and make it better  i’d like for us to help out more than we are page also mentioned nikola tesla with regard to invention and commercialization invention is not enough tesla invented the electric power we use but he struggled to get it out to people you have to combine both things invention and innovation focus plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people page announced a major management restructure in october  so that he would no longer need to be responsible for daytoday productrelated decision making in a memo page said that googles core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects including google x initiatives access and energy including google fiber smarthome automation through nest labs and biotechnology innovations under calico page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial chief product officer subsequent to the announcement the executives in charge of googles core products reported to then google senior vice president sundar pichai who reported directly to page in a november  interview page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his deep knowledge of googles products and breadth of projects as it had been a key motivating factor for team members in relation to his then role as the companys ceo page said i think my job as ceo—i feel like it’s always to be pushing people ahead alphabetedit on august   page announced on googles official blog that google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as alphabet inc with page becoming ceo of alphabet inc and sundar pichai assuming the position of ceo of google inc in his announcement page described the planned holding company as follows “ alphabet is mostly a collection of companies the largest of which of course is google this newer google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in alphabet instead  fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that aren’t very related ” as well as explaining the origin of the companys name “ we liked the name alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanitys most important innovations and is the core of how we index with google search we also like that it means alpha‑bet alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive for ” page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make google cleaner and more accountable he also wrote that there was a desire to improve the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within
