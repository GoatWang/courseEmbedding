 centsthe board had no interest in meeting with cove street capital principals in person or via telephoneaugust   westell technologies inc  north common drive aurora illinois  to the shareholders and board of directors of westell technologies inc nasdaqwstl cove street capital llc is a los angeles based investment management firm with  billion in assets under management an amount that sadly includes roughly  million shares of westell technologies inc westell or the company which represents  of the common stock class a shares outstanding lets get to it the board of westell is for all intents and purposes held captive by a family trust led by one robert buzz c penny iii specifically the trust owns  of the class a shares but more importantly owns the bvoting stock providing it a  control interest in the company the company was founded in  by mr pennys father clint penny and as far as we can tell buzz has never had anything to do with operating the company he has merely sat on the board of directors for almost  years as a controlling shareholder during that period buzz has presided over one of the worst shareholder records i have witnessed in my  years in the investment business it is difficult to add anything to this table of woe we are writing to call for an end to the charade before any more new growth ideas or second chance opportunities burn more cash and further destroy value just about any unbiased observer would conclude that the company should immediately hire a credible thirdparty investment banker and put the company up for sale in order to salvage what lemonade can be salvaged our extensive research suggests there are legitimate willing buyers who can provide scale to westells minute product line while the companys management team is an honorable group and has been forthright regarding the difficulties of the industry it has been proven by the experience of the last four ceos that telecommunications equipment supply is at best a low margin low return miserable industry when you have some scale what has become patently clear is that it is an exercise in futility to try and operate profitably at the size and scale of westell the announced restructuring plan is another exercise in futility and there is no line of sight for the company to end a near olympian record of burning cash for  out of the past twenty quarters the board of directors of westell led by their controlling shareholder have operated westell as a nearhobby for almost two decades burning cash through operations as well as poor acquisitions surely someone in the extended penny family cares about his or her inheritance and wants to receive some kind of final cash dividend instead of a used das conditioner in the mail another sad chart free cash flow nysefcf down the drain as a point of reference in  westell had  of cash per share in addition to some remainder assets that could have been sold for cash instead shareholders are looking at a current quote of  cents while we can go through several inches of paper that provides background on any number of these issues i find it difficult to imagine there is a shareholder alive including those with the penny surname who thinks that this is an acceptable state of affairs as the second largest shareholder in westell we have tried for several years to meet privately with robert penny iii who controls the trust which controls the majority of westells sharesand have consistently received a complete heisman from mr penny iii we were informed as recently as august th  via voicemail from counsel no less that once again he had no interest in meeting with cove street capital principals in person or via telephone we are always a proponent of intelligent and private discourse with our partners in public company investing histrionics and debating strategic direction in a public forum is rarely a process that best delivers value in an acceptable manner but every good idea has an inflection point where it stops being a good idea and we are at that juncture with westell since mr penny iii has definitively shut off options for intelligent and private discourse we are going very public in an attempt to frankly shame what is at best disinterested corporate governance unfortunately at this point we have zero confidence in their collective incentives and motivation to do the right thing for shareholders given their disastrous record of destroying their own wealth like a california voter who is not a registered democrat our vote may not mean much but we have the motivation and tools to be active … and loud we would be remiss if we did not add the following very timely issue the company has been notified by nasdaq that it is in violation of its  rule and our reading of nasdaq regulations suggests the company has until yearend to be above  or it will be delisted may i have a show of hands of who wants to own westell controlled by the penny family and its track record as basically a private company come to think of it maybe that is exactly what the controlling members of the trust are trying to achieve in closing we urge the penny trust and its advisors to do what is obvious and coincidentally in their best interest since the latter is apparently all that has ever mattered to them the choice to sell the company should be an easy one sincerely jeffrey bronchick cfa principal portfolio manager disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours business relationship disclosure i do not have business relationship with cove street capital llc and i am not being paid by any other party i think this letter is very relevant for the westell shareholders since it perfectly shows the current situation of the company seeking alpha investors should not invest in this stock until until the current board of directors acts according to its fiduciary duties editors note this article covers one

plan to vote against the board of directors of westell technologies inc after repeated rejection of request for discourse news provided by cove street capital llc aug    et share this article el segundo calif aug   prnewswire  as a follow up to an august  d filing with the sec and a letter to the board of directors of westell technologies inc nasdaq wstl westell or the company cove street capital llc cove street announces their intention to vote against the board of directors of westell cove streets attempts to establish a constructive dialog with westell have been rejected most recently in the form of a letter from ceo tom gruenwald—the public face of the company who is unfortunately tasked with answering for the companys past mistakes—professing that cove streets suggestions are being considered by the board we believe that the stocks performance over the last  years and the current share price speak for themselves states cove street principal and portfolio manager jeffrey bronchick cfa as such it is not clear to us what is left for the board to consider cove street presently owns  of the common stock class a shares outstanding making it the second largest shareholder after the penny family trust cove streets research suggests the following the last five years of operating results clearly indicate that the company does not have enough scale to consistently operate profitably produce positive free cash flow or generate returns above its cost of capital the lack of scale combined with end market cyclicality and customer concentration—the top  customers accounted for  of revenue in fy —create considerable risk of further negative free cash flow and shareholder value destruction given the current share price unless the board acts quickly the company is at risk of being delisted from the nasdaq there are numerous buyers for the companys assets and waiting to sell after more cash has been burned will likely only diminish the companys bargaining position the current board has shown no ability to facilitate a turnaround of the companys fortunes despite having brought in a number of ceos and supported numerous failed growth initiatives mr bronchick continues we fully understand that as aclass shareholders we can be outvoted by the penny familys bclass shares despite that shareholders still have the opportunity to voice their displeasure for the current state of affairs at the upcoming annual meeting to borrow an apt quote from carl icahn a lot of people died fighting tyranny the least i can do is vote against it

shareholders meeting of westell technologies inc on september th   of shareholders notaffiliated with the penny family trust withheld support for both robert c penny iii and his nephew robert foskett this is a clear repudiation of business as usual at westell states jeffrey bronchick cfa the lead principal of cove street capital llc which on behalf of its advisory clients is the largest noninsider shareholder of westell with  percent of the class a shares we once again call upon the penny family to take the obvious steps to preserve the value of the common shares obvious being the immediate hiring of an investment banker to sell the company robert c penny iii who leads the penny trust that controls the voting b shares of westell and has been a member of the board of directors since  continued to show his multidecade disdain of shareholder interests by managing not to attend the annual meeting as if to add color to a caricature of poor governance the company deemed it appropriate to release the results of the vote in a classic friday afternoon press release added bronchick eugene robin cfa a partner in cove street capital llc attended the annual meeting and gave the following speech to the board members who deemed it relevant and part of their fiduciary responsibilities as a board member of a public company to attend their annual meeting ladies and gentlemen my name is eugene robin and im a principal at cove street capital were the largest shareholders of this company not named penny while buzz and his family have been here from day one i doubt anyone else on this board or in this room truly knows the full history of this company since buzz joined the board westells history of value destruction goes all the way back to december of  when they spent approximately m to acquire teltrend a move that was supposed to refresh westell which was at the time a floundering company that was dedicated to losing money in the loop access business it may or may not be a coincidence that buzz joined the board officially only a year before but whatever the case the board with buzz representing the familys interests voted to acquire the company in order to restructure the business mix into a higher growth area namely hdsl modems a new ceo marc zionts was also installed in order to provide new growth leadership at the time of the teltrend deal shares were at  this was the first instance of a turnaround or new ceo story at westell with marc zionts lasting two years and getting bounced in  after buying teltrend and then promising a new westell driven by new products – after two years that narrative no longer held up as the westell continued to bleed operating cash and looked to be entering an industry downturn with incredibly high operating cost levels turnaround story number two comes by way of van cullens who came in to clean up the mess zionts created he immediately started laying off people and ran the company profitably for the next five years thanks primarily to growth in dsl modems across the country – as far as we can tell that was the last successful ceo that westell had although that success didnt translate into a stock price that moved very much from the time cullens took over to the day he retired by the time cullens stepped away westell was once again facing a core market that was in secular decline dsl and was staring at a bleak future that secular decline is reminiscent of the current state of cellular specialties after van cullens came thomas mader who arrived in january  to a company in a spiral downward competing against chinese manufacturers in a shrinking market and losing money hand over fist doing so mader attempted to enact the third iteration of a turnaround but within a year realized what few in this room seem to understand the business isnt capable of being saved from the forces affecting it with an absentee family controlling the companys strategic direction mader left unexpectedly nearly a year after joining we congratulate mader as being smarter than the rest of us in between mader and rick gilbert was a former board member named bernard sergesketter who stepped in to be a caretaker for the company while the company shed personnel and shrunk its footprint the board ushered in rick gilbert in  to enact the fourth iteration of a turnaround at westell gilbert came in realized what a mess the company was sold cns and then reinvested the proceeds into kentrox and cellular specialties – both have been disasters that are materially lower than when westell bought it since the day gilbert sold cns this company has bled about share in cash so why are we doing this why am i here im here because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result this is nothing against tom gruenwald and his team this is just us worrying for the wellbeing of shareholders who have seen their assets shrink with every iteration of a westell turnaround why would the fifth iteration be any different havent  years of mediocrity been enough to prove that this company is nothing more than a subscale failure that has no business being neither public nor a standalone company we are worried that there may not be a sixth turnaround to fall back upon if the board continues to try to get from under this rock on their own again this has nothing to do with management capability managements plan is sound on its face but leaves out an important fact the industry westell sells into is merciless consolidated on a customer level and structurally disadvantages subscale firms selling into it there is no place for westell at the table weve wanted to engage the board because this just feels like groundhog day to us same strategy a different management team and board and almost surely the same end result at this point we feel its necessary for us to stand up and say something and hope to intervene before all value is destroyed to paraphrase edmund burke all that it takes for assets to be squandered and shareholder value wasted is for good men to do nothing we call upon the board to immediately hire an investment banker and sell the company no more consultants new management teams turnaround hype or other useless alternatives that end up burning ever more cash selling this set of assets is the only way to recoup some value for shareholders and resolve a multidecade mess important information cove street capital llc a delaware limited liability company is a california based sec registered investment advisor that
