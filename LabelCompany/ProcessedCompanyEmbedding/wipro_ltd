consumer care healthcare lighting and infrastructure technology we are driven by our passion for quality and our commitment to customers this drive has catapulted us among the ten most admired companies in india through constant innovation and a peoplefirst attitude we strive to assume leadership positions in all our businesses in the new millennium history of wipro limited the thirdlargest company in india bangalorebased wipro limited is an evergrowing and everdiversifying global company that manufactures and sells products and services ranging from cooking oil and soaps to healthcare instruments and information technology it consulting although wipros chairman and managing director azim hasham premji is committed to the companys diversified business model its future clearly lies in its continued successes in software and it services which make up nearly half of the companys sales and has consistently outpaced the growth of wipros other businesses wipros worldclass technologies division provides a range of hightech services such as global it consulting ebusiness integration and legacy systems maintenance to clients such as cisco systems thomas cooke and nec wipros it efforts are so reliable that in  the company became the first in the world to have been awarded the software engineering institutes sei coveted level  certification for quality after an impressive debut on the new york stock exchange in  premji who owns  percent of wipro became one of the top billionaires in the world humble beginnings mids to earlys western india vegetable products ltd wipro limited was founded in  by mh premji the company sold vanaspati solidified sunflower oil to retailers who sold it in bulk scooping  and  grams for customers who brought along their own containers in  the same year that india gained independence from british rule yearold premji laid the foundations of a vegetable oil mill at amalner in maharashtra when pakistans prime minister offered him a position as finance minister premji turned it down citing his loyalty to india and his fledgling cooking oil business little did either man know that later in the new millennium wipros value would dwarf pakistans gross domestic product wipro went public in  for roughly  premji continued his political career along with his business in india he became the first indian chairman of bombay electricity board and a board member of the reserve bank of india the state bank of india and the life insurance corporation of india but premjis untimely demise occurred in  due to a heart attack soon after his yearold son azim left his unfinished studies in engineering at stanford university in the united states and returned home to india to take over the business what used to be a sleepy business run by various members of the family now became a highly professional one leaving azim premji as the only one in the family working at wipro—a characteristic that still would hold true decades later premji planned to professionalize diversify and expand his fathers business which was already valued at about  million he immediately recruited topnotch managers from the renowned indian institute of management iim where top graduates are also courted by bluechip firms in the west we were the pioneers in packaging for the mass market explains premji we went from bulk packs of vanaspati to singleuse consumer packs the packaging innovation took off and the marketing and distribution network expanded into rural areas at this point the company had no plans to go global by  business nearly doubled from when azim premji took over going hightech mids to lates the companys first departure from its main cooking oil business came about in  drawing azim premjis his engineering background and at the suggestion of one of the new iim recruits m seethapathy rao premji launched wipro fluid power an operation that manufactured hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders and under the direction of ps pai wipros consumer care division expanded beyond oil in  establishing operations in soaps toiletries and baby care products along with major expansions in distribution wipros consumer care division gained so much financial strength for the company that the company was able to further diversify into it and healthcare instruments wipro would diversify into computers almost as soon as indias computer industry began to develop in the mids at the time the indian government was the largest purchaser of computers sold in india and was standardized on the unixbased platform which helped indian companies build a solid reputation in unixbased software development the growing it industry in india attracted multinationals such as ibm motorola and texas instruments who took advantage of indias wealth of lowcost engineering labor but in  the indian government decided to throw out us computer giant ibm over a dispute about investment and intellectual property creating what premji saw as a golden business opportunity he quickly set up an electronics unit but instead of luring exibm employees into his business premji hired managers from a truck maker and a refrigeration company in  wipro launched information technology services for the domestic market setting up in bangalore a crackteam of rd and marketing managers headed by ashok narasimhan their professionalism innovation and insistence on quality were to make wipro the no  listed information technology company in the country within the next  years by  the company diversified into software which it would discontinue by  but it led to wipros foray into its growth business software services wipro began manufacturing pcs and workstations in  quickly building brand recognition and securing the enviable position of commanding a premium price over the competitions cheap clones wipro assembled and redistributed hardware for us companies like nortel sun microsystems and cisco systems indias million market in medical equipment attracted general electric co ge which in  chose wipro for a joint venture to develop and distribute ultrasound devices and other medical instruments especially throughout india and south asia in addition to creating a new business segment for wipro the joint venture instantly secured wipros reputation as a software integrator and led to scores of rd contracts with major companies including cisco systems hitachi and alcatel wipro ge came to be the largest exporter of medical systems rapid growth and expansion in the s indias software industry continued to take off throughout the nineties at a compounded annual rate of nearly  percent for most of the decade india quickly became the thirdlargest supplier of it labor and its communications infrastructure rapidly improved part of this growth was driven by a growing number of us corporations that began to tap into the cheap it labor market in india often for  percent to  percent less than the cost of us labor as a result wipro typically contracted out teams of engineers to work at usbased companies as successful as this model was it could not be counted on to last due to mounting competition and wipros growing need to offer more sophisticated technology solutions wipro began to shift its it business away from costly onsite development projects in the united states to more profitable offshore development closer to home to help keep its competitive edge the company replicated the development labs of some of its major clients including att ibm and intel corporation and while wipro continued to offer a range of programming services including hardware design networking and communications and operating system support—it continued to diversify into other lines of business in  the company established a new lighting business offering a range of lighting solutions for domestic commercial industrial and pharmaceutical lab environments wipro discarded its pc brand in  when it formed a joint venture with acer a taiwanbased computer and peripherals manufacturer and distributor by  bangalore became one of the many it centers in india with about  hightech firms plus about  just outside the citys limits and wipro became the center of this indian silicon valley as indias secondbiggest software exporter both software and hardware businesses generated  percent of the companys sales and  percent of its profits with software employees numbering over  of the companys  total still premji saw continued value in keeping wipros nonit businesses which he was always quick to point out were the best in their niche markets the company invested about  percent of its advertising budget into branding for its consumer care and lighting division the santoor brand for example grew by  percent in  wipros power cylinder business grew at a similar rate as its hardware business and kept the company well poised to benefit from any boom in future infrastructure expenditures in  wipro started exporting hydraulic cylinders throughout southeast asia also a lot of synergies existed between the medical systems and it businesses within wipro wipro ge emerged as the largest healthcare systems company in south asia in  and in that same year became the top exporter of such systems in india wipro proved to be a nimble and formidable competitor throughout the nineties from  to  for example wipro went through six corporate restructurings keeping the company ready to adapt to the constantly changing technological landscape by september of  wipros technologies division completed what may have been the most significant restructuring effort reengineering the divisions operations toward four major market sectors content housing platforms computers and web servers content transportation networking media content access devices mobile phones pcs etc and service providers and even its six sigma quality initiative which aimed to reduce the defect rate to virtually nothing already led to an eightfold gain over the investments in its first  months which began in  wipro projected that it would apply the six sigma concept allowing a maximum of  mistakes for every one million opportunities for error to every key process by  going global in the st century wipro seemed to have survived the effects of the us economic slowdown of  with massive layoffs and profit warnings and raced ahead in  amid its own soaring growth rates and a huge expansion in its operating margins given that  percent of indias itrelated services and software exports were tied to the us wipros unscathed emergence was remarkable by the end of march  the companys net income hit a record  million up  percent from the previous year and operating margins grew from  to  percent that same year while revenues from us clients declined to  percent from  percent revenues from europe climbed from  percent to  percent and revenues from japan did the same from  to  percent with a fleet of  japanesespeaking engineers and some  engineers dedicated to japanese customers including fujitsu nec daiwa sony toshiba and ntt docomo wipros japanese business promised to grow along with other continued investments in a diversified customer base wipro decided to set up an asiapacific regional base in singapore in  by this time wipro had a total of  active clients the top five of whom were fiberoptic network equipment major nortel networks british gas transport firm transco us conglomerate ge telecom equipment manufacturer lucent technologies and french telecom equipment maker alcatel along with diversifying its customer base wipro set out to expand and deepen its it service offerings and become a global tech powerhouse that directly competes with giants such as ibm global consulting accenture and electronic data service even though wipro came out of  quite well indias it industry quickly became flanked with growing competition from countries such as ireland china vietnam and the philippines and even though  percent of indian software exports were absorbed by businesses in the us in  that accounted for only  percent of the global total wipro decided to go beyond the unglamorous backoffice codewriting on contract and pursue even more highprofile highpaying projects that involved ebusiness development new software products and endtoend businesssystem consulting instead of doing small portions of large it software solutions wipro would set out to develop comprehensive endtoend solutions which included both software services and hardware and often involved outsourcing the simpler code work to other countries for example in august of  wipro launched a portalinabox which was a fixedprice endtoend solution to help businesses create a sales presence on the web wipros new upstream strategy would not only help stave off the growing competition but also enable wipro to continue its growth and keep its staff immune from the temptation to go west and start up their own software companies wipro also continued to aggressively refocus on offshore projects and expand its efforts in the domestic market wipro has come a long way from its simple sunflower oil business at the start of the new millennium wipro continued to prove itself a pioneer in three main businesses—consumer care and lighting healthcare technology services and information technology—altogether encompassing a broad range of highquality products and services with its solid reputation in these businesses deep ties with major world companies and newly opened offices
