options patients from all over the us have seen relief from their painwwwnationalpaincenterscompsoriashieldpsoriasis eczema vitiligo and alopecia areata are skin disorders that can tremendously negatively impact patients quality of lifeuntil recently this impact on quality of life was severely underestimated in fact today very little exists in the way of tracking the number of individuals with these diseases both in the united states and worldwide while far lesser diseases are actively tracked in recent years psoriasis awareness has experienced a sharp and welcome boost from a variety of organizations with that increase in public awareness has come increased funding driving clinical study of various technological and pharmaceutical products indeed pharmaceutical markets for drugs treating psoriasis have grown massively and are projected to continue growing eczema has very recently begun to experience an increase in awareness though funding and treatment inertia have yet to be on pace with that of psoriasispsoriashield promotes awareness of these diseases of their impact on quality of life and on the least toxic and most effective treatmentspsoriashield advocates the use of targeted uv phototherapy to address those aspects of patients disease which reduce their quality of life the most first by addressing the major detractors from patients quality of life initially patients and healthcare providers can address the remaining regions of skin with less aggressive therapyfor thousands of years healthcare providers have been prescribing sunlight for their patients in some cases it was the ultraviolet uv portion of that sunlight that was providing the real therapeutic benefit not only is uv phototherapy considered a mainstream dermatological treatment it is also used in internal medicine eg exposing blood to uv light to destroy certain pathogensexposing the skin to ultraviolet radiation either via sunlight or by a medical device produces several biological reactions the suntan and unfortunately the sunburn are very well known effects of exposure to uv light a sun tan indicates damage to the skin which the body must heal over time suntans and sunburns will cause the skin to look older prematurely this effect is known as photoaging in some cases too much exposure to uv light can cause skin cancerother effects of exposure to the sun include suppressing the immune system of the skin stimulating an increase in skin pigmentation stimulating production of vitamin d damaging the eyes and destroying some forms of bacteria viruses and fungusuv phototherapy is utilized for the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis vitiligo and eczema because uv light suppresses the immune system of the skin involved in disease propagation uv light can destroy abnormally proliferating skin cells uv light stimulates melanin production in functional melanocyctes both in the skin and hair follicles which increases skin pigmentation for patients with vitiligowwwpsoriashieldcom cnswellnesswe recognize that problems in one area of a clients life impact other areas and so our philosophy is designed to integrate all aspects of functioning we are

options patients from all over the us have seen relief from their painwwwnationalpaincenterscompsoriashieldpsoriasis eczema vitiligo and alopecia areata are skin disorders that can tremendously negatively impact patients quality of lifeuntil recently this impact on quality of life was severely underestimated in fact today very little exists in the way of tracking the number of individuals with these diseases both in the united states and worldwide while far lesser diseases are actively tracked in recent years psoriasis awareness has experienced a sharp and welcome boost from a variety of organizations with that increase in public awareness has come increased funding driving clinical study of various technological and pharmaceutical products indeed pharmaceutical markets for drugs treating psoriasis have grown massively and are projected to continue growing eczema has very recently begun to experience an increase in awareness though funding and treatment inertia have yet to be on pace with that of psoriasispsoriashield promotes awareness of these diseases of their impact on quality of life and on the least toxic and most effective treatmentspsoriashield advocates the use of targeted uv phototherapy to address those aspects of patients disease which reduce their quality of life the most first by addressing the major detractors from patients quality of life initially patients and healthcare providers can address the remaining regions of skin with less aggressive therapyfor thousands of years healthcare providers have been prescribing sunlight for their patients in some cases it was the ultraviolet uv portion of that sunlight that was providing the real therapeutic benefit not only is uv phototherapy considered a mainstream dermatological treatment it is also used in internal medicine eg exposing blood to uv light to destroy certain pathogensexposing the skin to ultraviolet radiation either via sunlight or by a medical device produces several biological reactions the suntan and unfortunately the sunburn are very well known effects of exposure to uv light a sun tan indicates damage to the skin which the body must heal over time suntans and sunburns will cause the skin to look older prematurely this effect is known as photoaging in some cases too much exposure to uv light can cause skin cancerother effects of exposure to the sun include suppressing the immune system of the skin stimulating an increase in skin pigmentation stimulating production of vitamin d damaging the eyes and destroying some forms of bacteria viruses and fungusuv phototherapy is utilized for the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis vitiligo and eczema because uv light suppresses the immune system of the skin involved in disease propagation uv light can destroy abnormally proliferating skin cells uv light stimulates melanin production in functional melanocyctes both in the skin and hair follicles which increases skin pigmentation for patients with
