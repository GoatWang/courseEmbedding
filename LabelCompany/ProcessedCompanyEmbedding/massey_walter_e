nation’s quality of life and the standard of living of its citizens and second that the general public’s understanding of science and technology is a critical component of a democratic society massey’s commitment to these principles has among other areas of advocacy additionally led him to be a proponent of the need for a strong system of national science education as well as the need to enhance the representation of women and minorities in science and technology massey has focused on arts and design education at the college and k levels working to improve student access to the arts

and philanthropic career  awards and honors  notes early life and educationedit born in  in hattiesburg mississippi massey displayed a gift for mathematics as a child and by the middle of high school his academic achievements had earned him a ford foundation fellowship to morehouse college in atlanta georgia there he began studying theoretical physics which he chose in part because it gave him the chance to rise above the discrimination he had witnessed as a youth in the segregated south of the s and s mentors played an important role in massey’s academic life initially he lacked direction at morehouse until receiving the guidance of sabinus h christensen a white physics instructor teaching at the traditionally black college for men christensen’s tutorials and support helped massey earn a bachelors degree in physics and mathematics later he continued his studies in physics under eugene feenberg as a doctoral student at washington university in st louis missouri while finishing his doctoral studies massey began working in  as a member of the research staff at argonne national laboratory which was operated for the us department of energy by the university of chicago massey’s work at argonne focused on the study of the manybody theory of liquids and solids which attempts to explain the properties of systems of interacting particles in various states he also continued his own research applying correlated basic functions to both liquid and solid helium two years later massey accepted an assistant professorship at the university of illinois academic career and early advocacyedit while continuing to pursue his own research massey’s tenure at the university of illinois was also defined by his commitment to achieving racial and social equality as well as to improving access to science and technology education on his first night on campus  black students who had protested racial discrimination at the university were arrested this incident led him to become advisor to the black students association and first chairman of the black faculty and staff association in his teaching meanwhile massey found that many of his black students lacked the preparation in mathematics and the sciences necessary for success at the college level this led to his interest in and commitment to the improvement of science teaching in high schools in  massey was offered an associate professorship at brown university which he accepted and would soon after complete some of his most significant academic research to date collaborating with humphrey maris on the study of changes in sound waves in superfluid helium by  he had been appointed a full professor and dean of the college also at brown massey continued his efforts to support diversity in the sciences developing and directing the inner city teachers of science inctos program through which brown undergraduates studying to become science teachers served as mentors and tutors in urban high school science classes the impact of this program earned massey the distinguished service citation of the american association of physics teachers in  in  massey’s demonstrated success as a researcher and administrator at brown led to his return to argonne national laboratory this time as its director in addition to which he was also appointed professor of physics at the university of chicago argonne national laboratoryedit at argonne massey assumed control of an annual budget of more than  million and a staff of almost four thousand but he also assumed control of a nebulous public relations image national laboratories at the time were highly suspect their work was not being translated to industry to the outside world the laboratories lacked clear missions on the inside scientists and technicians lacked morale to address these issues massey reorganized the governance of the laboratory in the early s instituting what d allen bromley president george hw bush’s assistant for science and technology referred to as “participatory democracy” among its scientists at the same time massey responded to the lack of outside connections by helping form the argonne national laboratoryuniversity of chicago development corporation arch an organization that expedited the transfer of technologies created in the laboratory to industry and the marketplace other initiatives massey undertook at argonne include generating support for its nuclear energy programs in a time of drastic cutbacks and providing support and leadership for the funding of major research facilities at the laboratory including the intense pulsed neutron source ipns the experimental breeder reactor  ebr and the initial funding for the advanced photon source aps while at argonne and the university

tell me what other people have in mind the deans in effect stand between the president and the students generally speaking the deans are apt to have a more liberal point of view than the president if only because they are likely to be younger and to sympathize more with students if only because they are more thoroughly involved with them  be kind to your deans they are good deans and there is a lot of good wear left in them do not attempt to undermine their position between you and the president but rather sympathize with them for both of the layers between which they are ground can be very

administrative posts at the university of california university of chicago brown university and the university of illinois throughout his more than forty years of professional life massey has been guided by two overarching principles first that science and technology are necessary to sustain the nation’s quality of life and the standard of living of its citizens and second that the general public’s understanding of science and technology is a critical component of a democratic society massey’s commitment to these principles has among other areas of advocacy additionally led him to be a proponent of the need for a strong system of national science education as well as the need to enhance the representation of women and minorities in science and technology massey has focused on arts and design education at the college and k levels working to improve student access to the arts and to highlight the important role they play in fostering student creativity and achievement massey is particularly interested in the intersections between the arts and sciences and in the ways broad exposure to both prepares students for future success and contributes to a more creative and dynamic

historical society and the public humanities award from illinois humanities contents  early life and education  academic career and early advocacy  argonne national laboratory  national science foundation  other domestic and international science policy experience  return to academia  business civic and philanthropic career  awards and honors  notes early life and educationedit born in  in hattiesburg mississippi massey displayed a gift for mathematics as a child and by the middle of high school his academic achievements had earned him a ford foundation fellowship to morehouse college in atlanta georgia there he began studying theoretical physics which he chose in part because it gave him the chance to rise above the discrimination he had witnessed as a youth in the segregated south of the s and s mentors played an important role in massey’s academic life initially he lacked direction at morehouse until receiving the guidance of sabinus h christensen a white physics instructor teaching at the traditionally black college for men christensen’s tutorials and support helped massey earn a bachelors degree in physics and mathematics later he continued his studies in physics under eugene feenberg as a doctoral student at washington university in st louis missouri while finishing his doctoral studies massey began working in  as a member of the research staff at argonne national laboratory which was operated for the us department of energy by the university of chicago massey’s work at argonne focused on the study of the manybody theory of liquids and solids which attempts to explain the properties of systems of interacting particles in various states he also continued his own research applying correlated basic functions to both liquid and solid helium two years later massey accepted an assistant professorship at the university of illinois academic career and early advocacyedit while continuing to pursue his own research massey’s tenure at the university of illinois was also defined by his commitment to achieving racial and social equality as well as to improving access to science and technology education on his first night on campus  black students who had protested racial discrimination at the university were arrested this incident led him to become advisor to the black students association and first chairman of the black faculty and staff association in his teaching meanwhile massey found that many of his black students lacked the preparation in mathematics and the sciences necessary for success at the college level this led to his interest in and commitment to the improvement of science teaching in high schools in  massey was offered an associate professorship at brown university which he accepted and would soon after complete some of his most significant academic research to date collaborating with humphrey maris on the study of changes in sound waves in superfluid helium by  he had been appointed a full professor and dean of the college also at brown massey continued his efforts to support diversity in the sciences developing and directing the inner city teachers of science inctos program through which brown undergraduates studying to become science teachers served as mentors and tutors in urban high school science classes the impact of this program earned massey the distinguished service citation of the american association of physics teachers in  in  massey’s demonstrated success as a researcher and administrator at brown led to his return to argonne national laboratory this time as its director in addition to which he was also appointed professor of physics at the university of chicago argonne national laboratoryedit at argonne massey assumed control of an annual budget of more than  million and a staff of almost four thousand but he also assumed control of a nebulous public relations image national laboratories at the time were highly suspect their work was not being translated to industry to the outside world the laboratories lacked clear missions on the inside scientists and technicians lacked morale to address these issues massey reorganized the governance of the laboratory in the early s instituting what d allen bromley president george hw bush’s assistant for science and technology referred to as “participatory democracy” among its scientists at the same time massey responded to the lack of outside connections by helping form the argonne national laboratoryuniversity of chicago development corporation arch an organization that expedited the transfer of technologies created in the laboratory to industry and the marketplace other initiatives massey undertook at argonne include generating support for its nuclear energy programs in a time of drastic cutbacks and providing support and leadership for the funding of major research facilities at the laboratory including the intense pulsed neutron source ipns the experimental breeder reactor  ebr and

headed the chicago mayoral task force on hightechnology development and was the founding chair of the chicago hightech association he also served on the illinois governor’s commission on science and technology and was highly visible on two educational fronts helping to organize the illinois science and mathematics academy one of the nation’s first residential high schools devoted to science and math education and serving as a trustee for the academy for mathematics and science teachers which trained almost  chicago public school teachers in those fields national science foundationedit massey’s efforts to forge a more productive relationship between the scientific community the us government and private industry culminated in  with his appointment as director of the national science foundation nsf under president george h w bush in this role massey embarked on a number of critical initiatives including efforts to deepen the connection between academia and industry and the establishment of the directorate for social behavioral and economic sciences and the commission on the future of nsf he also remained a strong proponent of basic research and science education focusing on providing grants to university research centers and individuals and on upgrading precollege science education with an emphasis on attracting more women and minority groups to careers in science in february  it was announced that scientists at the advanced laser interferometer gravitationalwave observatory ligo had observed gravitational waves for the first time ever confirming albert einstein’s  general theory of relativity in her announcement of the discovery dr france cordova current director of the nsf credited massey’s role in securing both approval and funding for the project nearly  years before “in  when thennsf director walter massey and the national science board approved ligo’s initial funding it was the largest investment nsf had ever made it was a big risk but the national science foundation is the agency that takes these kinds of risks” other domestic and international science policy experienceedit in concert with his roles at argonne and the university of chicago in  massey was named president of the american association for the advancement of science after having served as a board member for a number of years as president he led an organization

level under massey’s leadership the aaas aimed to improve science education in grades k  by sponsoring project  which attempted to structure curricula that would emphasize major scientific concepts in doing so massey and the aaas hoped to address the loss of the united states’ economic competitiveness in the world market beginning in the mids and to better prepare the nation to respond to the health and environmental crises that were afflicting the world at the time generally massey’s aim at the aaas was to instigate a shift in the national dialogue in which science and technology had

the general public’s understanding of science and technology is a critical component of a democratic society massey’s commitment to these principles has among other areas of advocacy additionally led him to be a proponent of the need for a strong system of national science education as well as the need to enhance the representation of women and minorities in science and technology massey has focused on arts and design education at the college and k levels working to improve student access to the arts and to highlight the important role they play in fostering student creativity and

fellowship to morehouse college in atlanta georgia there he began studying theoretical physics which he chose in part because it gave him the chance to rise above the discrimination he had witnessed as a youth in the segregated south of the s and s mentors played an important role in massey’s academic life initially he lacked direction at morehouse until receiving the guidance of sabinus h christensen a white physics instructor teaching at the traditionally black college for men christensen’s tutorials and support helped massey earn a bachelors degree in physics and mathematics later he continued his studies in physics under eugene feenberg as a doctoral student at washington university in st louis missouri while finishing his doctoral studies massey began working in  as a member of the research staff at argonne national laboratory which was operated for the us department of energy by the university of chicago massey’s work at argonne focused on the study of the manybody theory of liquids and solids which attempts to explain the properties of systems of interacting particles in various states he also continued his own research applying correlated basic functions to both liquid and solid helium two years later massey accepted an assistant professorship at the university of illinois academic career and early advocacyedit while continuing to pursue his own research massey’s tenure at the university of illinois was also defined by his commitment to achieving racial and social equality as well as to improving access to science and technology education on his first night on campus  black students who had protested racial discrimination at the university were arrested this incident led him to become advisor to the black students association and first chairman of the black faculty and staff association in his teaching meanwhile massey found that many of his black students lacked the preparation in mathematics and the sciences necessary for success at the college level this led to his interest in and commitment to the improvement of science teaching in high schools in  massey was offered an associate professorship at brown university which he accepted and would soon after complete some of his most significant academic research to date collaborating with humphrey maris on the study of changes in sound waves in superfluid helium by  he had been appointed a full professor and dean of the college also at brown massey continued his efforts to support diversity in the sciences developing and directing the inner city teachers of science inctos program through which brown undergraduates studying to become science teachers served as mentors and tutors in urban high school science classes the impact of this program earned massey the

work was not being translated to industry to the outside world the laboratories lacked clear missions on the inside scientists and technicians lacked morale to address these issues massey reorganized the governance of the laboratory in the early s instituting what d allen bromley president george hw bush’s assistant for science and technology referred to as “participatory democracy” among its scientists at the same time massey responded to the lack of outside connections by helping form the argonne national laboratoryuniversity of chicago development corporation arch an organization that expedited the transfer of technologies created in the laboratory to industry and the marketplace other initiatives massey undertook at argonne include generating support for its nuclear energy
