is a nongaap supplemental financial measure that management and external users of rex’s financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies may use to assess rex’s operating performance as compared to other similarly situated companies in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods the ability of rex’s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to its unitholders rex’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various expansion and growth opportunities management believes that the reference to rex’s ebitda in this press release is useful to investors because tallgrass natgas operator’s revenue directly correlates to rex’s ebitda rex’s ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income operating income net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities additionally because ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in rex’s industry its definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing its utilityrex generally defines ebitda as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortizationview source
