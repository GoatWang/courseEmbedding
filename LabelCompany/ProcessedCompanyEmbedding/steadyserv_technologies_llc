lot about a startup and where it is headed investors use this basic data to take the pulse of a startup among its competitors that aim for the same market several funding rounds and sizable investments are a good gauge of current investors confidence in the market the business and the team ideally youll want to see the startup developing from the lower left corner of the graph to the top

avoid overpaying for an equity stake in a startup comparing startup valuations in the same industry segment helps you read the mood and maturity of the market investors exit potential etc it also helps you see if a startup prices itself above or below its competitors considering its product development stage etc a startups precise value is impossible to estimate partly because parties rarely disclose the percentage of the company thats surrendered to investors in any given funding round however we can estimate a likely value range based on how startup investments usually work ok thanks
