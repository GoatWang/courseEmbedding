under the investor relations tab of our web site i will now turn the call over to drew alexander drew alexander thank you michelle and thanks to all of you for joining us wris portfolio is performing well much better than the message some of the media have reported over the last several months we think retail is changing as always what and how consumers are making purchases today is evolving our retailers along with our real estate is evolving as well the recent announcement that amazon is purchasing whole foods is clearly a sign of that change and is confirmation that brick and mortar stores are an essential component of the omnichannel model of the future good retail real estate still has good value our strategy over the last five years with the transformation has been to create the best quality real estate portfolio along with the best in class retailers we are confident that we are well positioned for the future we continue to be active underwriting acquisitions and would buy assets with the right risk growth profile but given what we see half way through the year we are lowering our acquisition guidance further with the disconnect between main street pricing and our share price we have increased our disposition efforts and accordingly increased our guidance we dont have a lot of significant changes in the new development area of possible interest to you at walter reed it appears that we are likely to transition from an equity ownership to the consulting role we are discussing the details of this with our partners and its not certain but it seems likely after future new developments we continue to work on projects but are being cautious with our risk profile redevelopment of the existing portfolio provides great returns on the invested capital and we continue to work those with great focus bottom line the quality of our transformed portfolio is evident given its solid performance while retail had some headwinds good retail real estate like ours continues to perform well steve the financials steve richter thanks drew i am pleased to once again report strong earning results core ffo for the quarter ended june   was  per share or an increase of  compared to  per share for the same quarter of last year the increase in core ffo over the prior year was primarily due to increases in rental rates the full year effect of our  acquisition and reduced interest expense from favorable debt refinancings these increases were partially offset by the impact of our disposition program and the dilution from our common shares issuance under our atm in  for the six months core ffo was  per share for  compared to  per share for  as to the balance sheet we have had little activity on the financing front our balance sheet remains in great shape with minimal maturities over the next several years at quarter end our net debttoebitda was  times and our debttototal market cap was  given our strong operating performance yeartodate we are increasing our  guidance for nareit ffo to a range of  to  per share and increasing core ffo guidance to a range of  to  per share further we are reducing guidance on acquisitions to  million to  million as to dispositions we are increasing guidance to a range of  million to  million if we achieve this level of dispositions it should have a minimal effect on  ffo as many of the transactions will close later in the year guidance on new development and redevelopment investments is decreased to a range of  million to  million as we dont expect to add any new projects to the pipeline for the balance of the year finally we remain comfortable with our guidance on same property noi including redevelopments of  to  all of these  guidance changes are detailed on page  of our supplemental johnny johnny hendrix thanks steve we are very pleased with the results the company produced this quarter strong leasing and occupancy increase of  basis points over the last quarter new lease rent growth of  and continued advancement in our redevelopment program while negative headlines have dominated in media our transformed portfolio continues to perform very well  of our noi comes from shopping centers anchored by supermarkets those supermarkets averaged sales of  per square foot that translates to over  million customer visits to our shopping centers each year many of our shop tenants are service oriented providing products not available online many of our box tenants including supermarkets are adjusting to current and future disruptions created by online merchants this will probably lead to pressure to reduce costs including rent paid to landlords so its important to remember rent is generally a fairly low percentage of overall cost to retailers as an example weingartens supermarkets average occupancy cost is only  of sales we have great locations and competitive rents so we believe the impact of the disruption will be manageable we are working through the bankruptcies of payless rue  gymboree and alfred angelo these tenants represent  stores if we lost all of them it would be less than sixtenths of  of annual base rent we dont expect they will close all the stores so its going to be very manageable the guidance we are providing accounts for the closing of most of these units during the quarter leasing was very strong we executed leases for  square feet representing  million in annual rent this is the most productive quarter we have had over the last couple of years the vast majority of the uptick was box leasing we executed leases with marshalls in burlington for former sports authority spaces and also leased the former target we purchased late last year in san antonio the blend of shop tenants has remained consistent over the last several years we are leasing to medical services health and beauty services indiscernible quick service restaurants and wireless services mostly we are leasing to internet resisting tenants not impacted by online sales we have a good pipeline to leases through the rest of  including leases for the last two sports authority boxes there is no guarantee any leases get signed but prospects are good its clear that negotiating leverage has generally swung back in favor of our tenants to supply with more boxes than shop tenants but our locations are strong and we are up in this indiscernible we will continue to make progress our overall rent growth for the quarter was a strong  the headline is a  increase in new leases that growth was heavily influenced by a single lease even eliminating the great rent increase in the one deal the new lease rent increase is a very healthy  yeartodate the company has produced spreads of over  on new leases and renewals occupancy at quarter end was up nicely to  thats  basis points over last quarter most of that increase resulted from the leasing of those boxes i mentioned earlier regionally atlanta and raleigh continue to be very strong at  and  respectively houston also continues to perform very well with overall occupancy at  its worth mentioning that occupancy will be negatively impacted next quarter as we continue to remerchandize the shops at memorial on interstate  here in houston the property is a former industrial facility that we have been converting to retail over the last several years the last industrial tenant an  square foot electrical supply distributor is terminating during the third quarter long term its a great story we will improve the tenant mix and significantly increase the rent same property noi continues to be solid during the quarter we generated an increase of  including redevelopments base minimum rent for that same pool of properties increased  yeartodate we produced an increase of  which is the midpoint of our guidance for the rest of the year we expect the fallouts to cost us about  million in net operating income but this will be more than offset by leases coming online which will contribute about  million in noi this leaves us comfortable with our guidance of  to  for  the companys redevelopment pipeline continues to generate strong results we currently have  active projects with anticipated investments of  million the incremental return should be around  by far the largest redevelopment is the driscoll at river oaks which will include a  storey residential high rise and  square feet of retail excluding the driscoll the return on redevelopments is over  we are very active pursuing potential acquisitions but we have been very selective we will continue to look for great assets with good growth it seems to us that core assets have remained very competitive with cap rates between  and  slightly lower in coastal markets valuations of noncore assets have slipped a little since the beginning of the year underwriting standards are tightening with buyers very sensitive to risk of box renewals and potential over market rents while our operations have some challenges ahead i remain confident our tenants and our portfolio will adjust and continue to produce strong results drew drew alexander thanks johnny another great quarter and i am very pleased with how we started the year the media has painted a more dire picture for retail than what we are experiencing in our centers we have always been knowing as great shopping center operators and now we have the added benefit of a significant transformed higher quality portfolio of properties so i remain confident that we will navigate our way through this unsettled environment recall  of our rent come from centers with a grocery component and those grocers average a strong  per square foot in sales bringing thousands of people to our centers each month while the amazon whole foods deal will drive change in the grocery sector we believe that it will be a positive for our real estate long term our supermarket operators will adapt and evolve as well and we will assist them with our great locations wri was formed from a supermarket company almost  years ago thus we have seen a lot of change and evolution in the retail business especially the supermarket space the media told us webvan would eliminate the need for bricks and mortars locations and when that didnt transpire they told us walmart and the membership clubs would eliminate the need for our shopping centers i believe we will continue to evolve our shopping centers will become the launching pad for the last mile for ecommerce while continuing to provide our tenants many of whom are restaurants and serviceoriented with great locations for their business great people great properties and a great platform equals great results i thank you for joining the call today and for your continued interest in weingarten operator wed now be happy to take questions questionandanswer session operator thanks drew we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and from citi we have christy mcelroy please go ahead katy mcconnell good morning this is katy mcconnell on for christy given the amount of box leasing you did during the quarter can you talk about the level of demand you are seeing today versus a year ago in terms of the number of retailers interested in any given space and then can you also discuss the increase in tis this quarter and whether that was oneoff or if we should expect more elevated levels as you continue to work through the bankruptcy space johnny hendrix good morning katy this is johnny let me answer i guess the last quarter first i expect that over the next several years we will see increased levels of ti for boxes in this particular situation there are really two leases that heavily skewed the number and without those two leases it would have been  so we feel good we got great increases on where we spent the money so i think it was a good investment as to leasing boxes going forward i think we are about where we were a year ago really as we work through the sports authority boxes we came to see a little bit less demand from retailers particularly hardgoods we still have great interest from tj maxx ross the pet stores the fitness stores some of the others have fallen off but its about the same it does appear that the leverage on their part has improved and we will just have to see as we go along if we are able to continue to work through that katy mcconnell okay thats helpful thank you operator from baird we have rj milligan please go ahead will harman hey good morning this is will harman on for rj just a quick question about walter reed you mentioned moving to more of a consulting role i was hoping if you could just provide a little bit more color on that decision drew alexander sure this is drew its a great location and we have a wonderful relationship with the different partnerships but it appears and again i try to give the signal because nothing is certain but it appears that it makes sense to everybody it has to do with the vertical integration of the project and how the use is mixed together that it just seems having one capital source could be just a better way to approach it for all concerns so its very cordial discussions very collaborative as i said its early but it hinges around the complexity the mixed use the integrated mixed use nature and it seems likely that we will move to more of a consulting role so hopefully that helps it is early but something that i wanted to give everybody heads up on will harman thats helpful and then on pages  and  in the supplement of this quarter where you disclosed your development redevelopment projects and their expected yields looks like you have made some slight downward revisions to your targeted yields for both development and redevelopments could you just talk a little bit about those downward revisions and what has changed over the past quarter and how you have underwritten these projects steve richter good morning will this is steve on page  both for q and for q the new development information is presented there quite frankly if you look for the  return that we have for the three projects that number has remained consistent in footnote number  we show the breakout for the different types of  the different components of the project between retail resi and office quite frankly we made a mistake in q those numbers in the footnote  were incorrect when one runs the basic it basically doesnt equate back to the  and we corrected that in the footnote  in the second quarter and everything is fine going forward so we apologize for any confusion will harman and then just that overall active redevelopment yield it was  to  last quarter its down  bps this quarter to   any color on that johnny hendrix hey will this is johnny we have actually changed the scope of the redevelopment at winter park and at sunset  again i think these are going to be very positive of work on rues ph and parking lot as part of the redevelopment on one and increased the  had another tenant on another one so thats really whats going on there will harman okay and just last one for me property taxes were a little bit higher in the quarter up around  million compared to the run rate of around  million just curious what drove the spike and what we should be modeling for the run rate going forward steve richter well this is steve and quite frankly thats just the valuation of the properties in our annual adjustment if you look at the offset you also have an increase in recovery so it really doesnt flow to the bottom line that significantly will harman okay thanks guys operator from ubs we have nick yulico please go ahead greg mcginniss yeah good morning everyone this is greg mcginniss on for nick i was just hoping you could elaborate a bit on the shift in transactions in terms of what you are seeing in the acquisition market is it just too crowded are the assets you want no longer available drew alexander good morning its drew we are very active we have participated in many deals underwritten a lot of deals but then if you will the bridesmaid a lot are the stalking horse but we do find things very competitive last year we had a fabulous year and i think we said at the time there was a little luck and a few breaks we remain active in the target markets where we are and i am optimistic that we will find some things we are very focused on growth as i have said before and i think it does support what johnny said that the good centers the quality centers that we want to buy are very much in demand and the pricing is very strong on those while we love to win more it does make us feel very good about the value of the portfolio greg mcginniss great thanks and then with the increase in dispositions but the decrease with the redevelopment fundings wondering what that cash is going to be used for drew alexander so thats something we will certainly keep in mind some of it is a definite long term strategy that we think there is a major disconnect in terms of the public valuations and where the assets are worth we certainly want to say leverage neutral and in all our projections its very challenging but distinctly possible that we will have some sort of special dividend given the age of some of the properties and a lot of that of course relates to what sort of success we have in acquisitions and what  if anything we can  which is really hard to forecast so we do want to be leverage neutral after the special dividends so we have got some debt certainly that we could look at as well as other things and a lot of it is a right long term given the stocks at some amount of discount to nav greg mcginniss great thanks and just a final question whats your expectation on closing the gap between signed and commenced occupancy steve richter hey greg we are about  basis points between signed and commenced today which is  it was a big number for us and that represents about  million in annual rent and about  million in the annual rent will come on board in the second half of this year so we would look towards the first half of  to really kind of get back to what i would think would be a normal number in that  to  range greg mcginniss all right great thanks so much appreciate it operator operator instructions and from hilliard lyons we have carol kemple please go ahead carol kemple good morning in your conversations with retailers are you seeing them trying to get more concessions and are they having any luck with that or do you just have better options and you are letting them go johnny hendrix good morning carol we have had that circumstance since i have been with the company retailers are always fun and they are always looking to reduce their costs and they have always been looking to reduce the rent and get more tis we have great locations and so i think we have been very competitive on the rents we have been able to get and i think that thats going to be pretty consistent going forward so we havent seen much in the way of rent reduction requests other than tenants who are currently bankrupt and again thats something we have seen for years but i really havent seen as much as i would have actually thought based on all the news that i have read we were at icse in may tenants said that they were aware of this leverage shift but again we havent seen it at this point carol kemple thats good to hear thanks johnny hendrix thank you operator operator instructions and from suntrust we have anthony hau anthony hau good morning thanks for taking my questions i am just curious if you have looked at net effect of rent spread for new leases given that you mentioned we might see an increased level of ti going forward and what would that number look like compared to the  spread drew alexander anthony good morning its drew its something that we look at i think there is a variety of ways to do it the tis are certainly disclosed as johnny said except for the two deals its pretty normal at the  something a square foot so its certainly something that we are cognizant of and look at but i think there is a lot of different ways to put a number to it anthony hau okay thank you operator and standing by for any further questions looks like no further questions at the moment drew we will turn it back to you for closing remarks drew alexander thank you brandon just want to let everybody know we will be around all day if there is any further questions i hope you have a great weekend and a great summer and thank you very much for your interest in weingarten all the best operator thank you ladies and
