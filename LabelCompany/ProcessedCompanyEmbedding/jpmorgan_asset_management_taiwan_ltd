for market views from the global fixed income currency  commodities team gficc consistent with our and the market’s expectations the federal open market committee the fomc left the fed funds rate unchanged at ‐ the fed’s only means of communication at this meeting was the typical fomc statement the fomc used the july statement to prepare the market for an official balance sheet announcement at the september meeting by effectively “markingtomarket” recent economic developments and indicating that a change in the fed’s reinvestment policy would be coming “relatively soon” the committee readied the market for the balance sheet runoff while leaving the prospects for additional rate hikes dependent on inflation data we can break the committee’s statement into four parts economic assessment – the committee upgraded its already positive assessment of both the labor market and the overall us economy they also softened their assessment on inflation acknowledging the persistent weakness in the data outlook – the committee kept the outlook unchanged and expects an eventual return of inflation to its  objective forward guidance –the committee continued to describe future actions as ‘gradual’ and stressed their current policy stance was accommodative balance sheet – the statement indicated that a change in existing investment policy would be appropriate “relatively soon” there were no dissenters at the meeting our view  the fomc was fairly balanced reflecting a marktomarket on the recent data they are confident that the positive developments in the labor market and the broader economy will allow them to push ahead with balance sheet reductions later in the year the committee is waiting for signs that the recent soft patch in realized inflation is reversing before raising the policy rate for a rd time in  the committee continues to favor a gradual approach to tightening policy as they juggle incoming information on inflation growth and fiscal policy as well as the market’s reaction to balance sheet normalization we view the balance sheet reinvestment plan laid out in the june addendum as essentially a “done deal” ideally once the process starts in september the balance sheet normalization will run on autopilot as a secondary tool while rate hikes will remain the primary tool of removing accommodation any additional changes to the fed’s schedule for balance sheet shrinkage once it begins will likely only be made if economic conditions were to deteriorate materially despite the recent weakness in inflation readings future rate hikes are still warranted by the economic and labor market data fiscal policy initiatives will continue to play an increasingly important role in the fomc’s decisionmaking process for the number of rate hikes the us economy can handle in  we expect the fed will raise rates  more time in  improving global growth expectations of fiscal expansion and regulatory reform will create an environment that is supportive of risk assets at the expense of treasury yields despite the coming contraction in global central bank liquidity we expect that the reduction in global central bank liquidity will move into the market’s purview as the year progresses  inflation has remained stubbornly weak for the past  months but should return to a pace closer to the fed’s longerrun target this will allow year yields to move higher

portfolio manager us macro strategies a “structural reform” for the kids posted on july   the group of ’s stated goal is “strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth” amen to that  the qualityoflife triple threat of low productivity unfavorable demographics and stifling income inequality would all be licked if the g achieves that goal  the challenge of course is how to get there policy makers economists and the group itself all fall back on the triedandtrue prescription of “structural reforms”  that catchall phrase is prominent in their publications but one usually has to dig deep to uncover the specifics of what really these folks are recommending for the us infrastructure investment tax reform and regulatory reform—to the extent they rigorously address inefficiency productivity or inequality—would all count  today however i want revisit in more detail a different proposal that i’ve discussed in the past and expand on it with three key charts from the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd in short a wholesale change in the us approach to childcare could have a profoundly positive impact on growth and quality of life the idea is unusual in that it is motivated by two factors which are often in conflict but here are aligned first a clinical focus on key macroeconomic outcomes and second deferential attention to smallscale outcomes for human individuals which improve the opportunities incentives and quality of life for families in the economy  the result could unlock significant gains in both productivity and hours worked while at the same time counteract rising inequality—the three keys to sustainable and inclusive growth the united states government spends the secondleast on preschool and childcare of the  individual countries plus the eu measured as a whole studied by the oecd when parents consider reentering the workforce childcare costs are a significant deterrent to doing so for single parents as well as the second earner in a twoparent household reentering the workforce in the united states the implicit tax rate is the fourthworst in the oecd  it totals some  of gross pay just for taxes childcare and benefit reductions the result is an inefficient system where primary caregivers are compelled to provide inhome childcare in lieu of participating in the wider economy the impediments persist as children grow and their care needs are only partially met by primary school with summer holidays and significant portions of the traditional workday hours still not covered  parents are forced to accept jobs which can accommodate a certain schedule rather than jobs which allow them to maximize their productivity earnings and participation in the economy if the united states treated childcare like public education where every parent who wished could enroll their children in allday enriching childcare at little or no outofpocket cost the economic benefits on both a macro and micro scale could be substantial job creation the many primary caregivers who are talented and passionate about the work could do it professionally and this is a job that is not easily automated the infrastructure needs on an upfront and ongoing basis are also potentially significant requiring skilled construction work regardless whether the programs are publicly or privately administered increased labor force participation and hours worked the implicit “reentry tax” would be removed as a serious disincentive to join the labor force and barrier to pursuing new skills training increased productivity individuals as they see fit can pursue jobs to maximize their quality of life earnings and contribution to the economy at a level greater than the purely monetary cost of caring for  children per day which is the average number of children under  in each household with children decreased inequality childcare is a benefit for all families paid for by the existing progressive tax system the first four are dispassionate assessments of the raw st order macroeconomic effects which would be critical to justifying the expense and helping pay for it over the short term but there is a bigger issue at the heart of the proposal with longerterm implications providing all children with equal access to robust early childhood education reliable care and a structure through which other basic health and nutrition needs can be met efficiently and consistently will help strengthen the youngest generation of americans they are the future us economy clearly any program like this whether it’s done with physical structures extensions of the public education system or through vouchers and refundable tax credits would be costly however the realistic potential growth uplift outlined above allows “dynamic scoring” to be used with confidence for at least partial selffunding  dynamic scoring uses future growth expectations realized in the form of higher tax revenues to fund current expenditures  the concept is frequently abused because growth forecasts are too optimistic but in this case the pure economic effects are pretty simple  near term funding through progressive taxation can provide a plausible bridge to a period of sustainably higher and more inclusive growth  higher sustainable growth with less inequality allows a larger share of the economy to eventually make meaningful tax contributions  the ability of the economy to sustain less progressivity in the tax code ought to be a “win” for both political parties any structural reform which can plausibly create jobs increase labor force participation increase productivity and reduce inequality would produce meaningful progress toward “strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth” reforming the childcare system could potentially do all of this while encouraging participation and engagement in the economy by all parents who wish to do so share facebook linkedin google twitter email rss posted in
