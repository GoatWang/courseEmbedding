that business leaving the remaining company as an infrastructure business focused mainly on powerindustry products and services plans call for the headquarters of both companies to remain in charlotte housed in the current spx building it is unclear whether either company will retain the spx name spx officials have not yet decided what either business will be called enlarge the two companies formed by spxs proposed split would remain in charlotte sharing space… more nancy pierce we  believe this action will create significant value for our shareholders customers and employees spx chairman and ceo chris kearney told analysts during a conference call wednesday we believe the spinoff will provide both companies greater flexibility to focus on and pursue their respective growth strategies chief financial officer jeremy smeltser told analysts the deal is expected to be completed as soon as late july although the transition could take as long as a year the company expects to incur onetime costs of  million to  million because of the separation leadership plan kearney will be chairman and chief executive of the new flow company that will be the larger of the two new businesses with annual revenue projected around  billion and earnings before taxes interest depreciation and amortization estimated at around  million gene lowe now president of spxs thermal segment will be ceo of the infrastructure company he has been with spx since  michael mancuso former chief financial officer of general dynamics and an spx board member since  will be chairman of that companys board the infrastructure company would have revenue close to  billion and ebitda around  million the action accelerates our goal of creating a pureplay flow company that will be wellpositioned as a leading provider of flow technologies across three broad end markets kearney said the remainder of spx the future infrastructure company will also be wellpositioned as a global infrastructure platform with marketleading positions kearney and his team have been saying for several years now that spxs future was in the flow operations which provide processing systems for the food and beverage industry and pumps valves and other key components for the oil gas and electric power industries the question has long been what would happen to spxs other divisions activist investors when kearney took over as ceo in  spx was at the start of divesting a number of businesses from a company that had grown into a sometimesunwieldy conglomerate the company has been focused for some time now on three basic units — flow technology thermal equipment and industrial products the last two units will form the new infrastructure company kearney and smeltser emphasized that the spinoff was the next logical step for the company the company had been focusing on expanding its flow and thermal operations through late  then activist investment firm relational investors stepped in and started buying up large shares in spx criticizing what it called managements growth at any costs strategy spx dropped out of negotiations for a major acquisition at that time though the company never acknowledged the negotiations it worked with relational on strategy even at one point offering to put members of relationals choosing on the spx board spx focused more tightly on enhancing returns and the spinoff appears designed to further that goal breaking the company in two divisions makes each piece freer to pursue individual growth strategies clear plays the separation also makes each company a clearer investment play in different industries one analyst on the call even suggested that the flow business could become an acquisition target though kearney and smeltser emphasized that both new companies are being set up with capital and debt structures to be successful standalone businesses the considerations that led to the decision to divide the company appear similar to those that have charlottebased the babcock  wilcox co contemplating a similar move bw nysebwc is looking at separating its powerindustry operations from its government contracting lines of business again in that case there have been significant
