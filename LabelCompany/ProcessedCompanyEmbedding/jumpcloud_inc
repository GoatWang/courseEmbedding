guides you’re safe with jumpcloud jumpcloud takes security very seriously we understand we’re asking you to trust us and we want to make sure you’re comfortable with our internal security practices so that you know the data you store with us is wellprotected and managed agent communication jumpcloud manages a private pki infrastructure to manage digital certificates for twoway tls authentication and encryption between our servers and each agent each agent has its own unique private key generated at install time which is signed by jumpcloud’s private ca and we associate that key with our servers by storing its public key in our database the jumpcloud agent does not listen on any ports and thus provides no attack surface for a remote attacker all communications between the jumpcloud agent and the jumpcloud saas infrastructure are created outbound from the agent assessments and independent audits jumpcloud leverages a third party assessor to perform monthly vulnerability scans against its environment and integrates those results into its development workflow based on priority code audits and penetration testing by a qualified thirdparty assessor are executed three times per year jumpclouds commitment to security includes measures to have independent audits to evaluate the operational and security processes of our service our employees and company at large jumpcloud has successfully completed a type  soc  examination for their directoryasaservice daas system the results of this examination are available upon request to customers by emailing securityjumpcloudcom employment all employees undergo mandatory security awareness training as well as year criminal and employment background checks prior to employment recovery jumpcloud leverages devops best practices to ensure that our entire environment is highly available we leverage redundant infrastructure in disparate service providers particular parts of the environment vary in recovery time from a matter of seconds up to a few minutes depending upon their size and number of dependencies infrastructure security access controls jumpcloud’s private pki is leveraged to create and manage all our vpn keys so all vpn and agent access can be easily revoked at any time vpn server access is limited to key employees with a verified and documented business need and requires both a private key and a password to be accessed jumpcloud’s production infrastructure is distributed across multiple public clouds all users are accesscontrolled using multifactor authentication the production accounts use strict iam roles and only key employees with a verified business need receive administrative access data protection all database disk volumes utilize dataatrest encryption to prevent data access by unauthorized parties monitoring jumpcloud utilizes monitoring software to track all user logins and privileged commands and to alert on any anomalies jumpcloud the product is also used to ensure that all our servers remain fully patched further all log files are written to central log hosts which are monitored using ossec to catch any anomalous issues this helps prevent log tampering during compromise of any edge host as well as ensures that logged security issues do not go unnoticed finally jumpcloud uses ossec to alert on changes to critical configuration files and installed software  users free

the flatirons apply today what we look for in people at jumpcloud we are a small team striving to dislodge the greatest monopoly in the history of it we find there are three core qualities in those we hire that help us succeed the ability to learn quickly a passion for their job and great work ethic fast learner if you haven’t seen something before can you quickly relate it to things that you do understand and then evaluate the differences do you ask questions that help you better grasp concepts when working with concepts are you able to identify the assumptions and the structural components that underpin them we want to see you deconstruct elements of your past work along with the cuttingedge challenges that we are facing in our business today passionate in fast growing companies passion is what makes the difference at larger companies existing momentum can carry the company to continue to be successful over many future years not so at startups we need to manufacture our own momentum and the only way to make that happen is to be passionate about what we are doing is it the career that was meant for you if you’re truly passionate you should be able to show us what you are doing to improve yourself and your skills work ethic smart work plus hard work will help us pull forward and have a chance to succeed we want to hear about how you’ve worked smart and hard in the past what does working hard mean to you hint a lot of hours doesn’t necessarily mean working hard to us finding the best fits for an organization is always difficult there’s the technical skill set fit and the cultural fit there’s the concrete and the intangibles this page couldn’t possibly include everything we’ll be looking for during an interview but we did want to shed light on the qualities that make

everybody’s problem it is the  conduit to your network being compromised whether it is brute force login attacks or your user’s identity being compromised elsewhere on the internet your network is
