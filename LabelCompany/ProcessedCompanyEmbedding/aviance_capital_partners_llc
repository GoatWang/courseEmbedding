infoaviancepartnerscom client portal aviance capital partners focused asset management menu about us strategies our team market commentary contact us strategies   all investors are unique so are solutions   service and results are top priority client goals and our strategies are combined to build lasting and successful relationships each client is assigned a wealth relations manager to ensure robust service and reviews boutique environment with team approach to asset management     disciplined value highquality deeply discounted businesses across all capitalizations read more our approach to value investing focuses on owning shares of highquality deeply discounted businesses when a business is on solid footing it often receives a high credit rating similarly we define quality by understanding a company’s credit worthiness and the soundness of its business model as a result sound businesses that have little need to raise capital also have greater flexibility to execute their operating and growth strategies further we believe companies that are governed by boards and executives who are in the habit of sharing their earnings through dividend payments have strong incentives for longterm business success as such the disciplined value strategy favors companies that possess these hallmarks of quality and are trading at prices that reflect a significant discount to fair value   enhanced income high level of income through the most attractive riskadjusted opportunities read more there are more than twenty different asset classes which may generate investment income the attraction of each different income producing asset class depends upon many factors including interest rates inflation and position in various economic cycles many of these asset classes are not as sensitive to interest rates as bonds however they may be more sensitive to economic cycles all investments possess different risk factors which must be carefully considered prior to purchase we review these methods of income generation and actively allocate capital to those asset classes offering a higher level of income with a lower probability of capital depreciation when compared to traditional fixed income investments and with regard to current economic cycles   concentrated stock options strategies tailored to produce income andor hedge the downside read more several investors attribute a significant portion of their wealth to ownership in one or two companies as these positions grow larger so do the risks related to diversification volatility and tax burdens our approach to reducing these risks involves understanding the unique circumstances of the client and choosing the best strategy a common strategy for managing concentrated positions employs the use of “covered call” or “collared” option strategies however the chosen strategy and its implementation depend on the client’s long term intentions for the position tax circumstances and market environment   global plus valuetilted exposure to both international and domestic markets read more for investors seeking broad exposure to global stock markets the global plus strategy offers a valueoriented solution the strategy invests in a variety of exchangetraded funds etfs and closedend funds cefs aviance’s search for global value among etfs focuses on broad market securities and attractive fundamental characteristics – like low pricetoearnings ratios among other factors further the strategy invests in cefs that are generally trading at significant discounts to net asset value we believe this approach positions investors to take advantage of discounted investments in the global space disciplined growth largecap growth companies with strong fundamentals at ideal entry points read more growth characteristics are one of acceleration change and improving fundamentals our proprietary analysis looks for intrinsic markers that portend growth while simultaneously looking for favorable entry points – referred to as “growth at a reasonable price” garp aviance capital partners conducts screens looking for acceleration in areas that include earnings growth sales growth margin expansion and discretionary cash flow as we evaluate our screen results we focus on predominately largecap companies with a net present value above the current market price based on cash flow calculations and attempt to set valuation strike points   disciplined growth hedged access to our growth strategy coupled with options to reduce the downside read more the disciplined growth hedged strategy offers a way for investors to access our growth strategy but further seeks to reduce market volatility and downside risk by employing market hedging techniques we seek to strike an optimal balance between the cost of the hedge and its likely protection against adverse market conditions   traditional fixed income municipal or corporate portfolio tailored to each clients’ specific needs read more for investors seeking to preserve capital and generate income we offer traditional bond portfolios consisting of only investmentgrade credit quality bonds such as municipal corporate andor government issued  each portfolio is custom built to serve the needs of the investor we seek to add value by taking advantage of the shape of the yield curve attractive spread opportunities and issuespecific opportunities   core plus fixed income exposure to all fixed income classes through bottomup security selection read more our core plus fixed income strategy is suited for investors seeking broad exposure to bond markets with the potential for attractive rates of distributed income the strategy invests in a variety of exchangetraded funds etfs and closedend funds cefs the core element of the strategy invests in etfs that seek to match the performance of the broad fixedincome markets the plus element of the strategy seeks to outperform the fixedincome market by investing in fixedincome oriented cefs that are generally trading at a significant discount to net asset value   who we are as a private ownermanaged investment management firm our primary focus is building customized equity
