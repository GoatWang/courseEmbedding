offerings of residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs the firm agreed to a settlement in which it will pay  million the sec plans to distribute the money to harmed investors the sec alleges that jp morgan misstated information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans that provided collateral for an rmbs offering in which it was the underwriter jp morgan received fees of more than  million and investors sustained losses of at least  million on undisclosed delinquent loans jp morgan also is charged for bear stearns failure to disclose its practice of obtaining and keeping cash
