published by law offices of jeffrey s glassman llc boston personal injury attorney blog published on august   mitchell v city of warren products liability personal injury cases by law offices of jeffrey s glassman mitchell v city of warren a case from the united states court of appeal for the sixth circuit involved a rather unusual set of circumstances that resulted in the tragic death of plaintiff according to court records an officer responded to a call for assistance to provide backup to another officer who was in the process of conducting a traffic stop the first officer alleged plaintiff was driving with expired license plates when the officer initiated the traffic stop the yearold plaintiff then allegedly ran from his car and tried to hide in an abandoned house the second responding officer arrived as the first officer was attempting to secure plaintiff at this point there was a struggle between plaintiff and arresting officers and second responding officer took out his policeissued taser and fired at plaintiff as our boston personal injury attorneys can explain tasers work somewhat differently that most people are aware the devices actually fire a barbed projectile called a taser dart that resembles a miniature harpoon or straightened fish hook the dart has a barb at the end that is designed to go through clothing and pierce suspect’s skin where it gets embedded after being tased paramedics often have to cut the barb off the dart in order to remove it from suspect a taser fires two darts at the same time in this case one dart hit plaintiff in his heart the second dart hit plaintiff a few inches below his heart suspect fell to the ground and was nonresponsive the taser current had stopped plaintiff’s heart police called an ambulance to the scene but paramedics were unable to revive plaintiff and he was pronounced dead on scene victim’s family filed a lawsuit against the city the officers and the maker of the taser device the city settled the other claims and the lawsuit proceeded against the maker of the taser as part of the discovery process officers testified the manufacturer trained that the device was safe even if it was fired at a suspect’s chest the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case claiming under michigan law there was no duty to warn a buyer of a risk after the product was sold and there was no duty assumed by performing a training series there was no proof the officer who fired at suspect would have ever seen a warning had one been issued unfortunately for plaintiff’s family appellate court affirmed summary judgment for the defendant it is not clear that the result would be the same had the case occurred in massachusetts as our courts tend to side with plaintiffs is many situations massachusetts and boston especially is no stranger to cases involving people injured or killed by supposedly nonlethal or less lethal weapons many will recall the yearold emerson student who was killed during a celebration following the patriots super bowl in this incident a paintball filled with pepper spray was allegedly fired at point black range and it went through her eye causing deadly

sdchicagoinjurylawcom call us  sinas dramis law firm blog search this website homesinas dramis law firm blogtaser death case looks at duty to warn of potential injury taser death case looks at duty to warn of potential injury the mitchell case concerning a taser death centered around whether taser had a duty to warn the warren police department about risks involved with the use of its products the sixth circuit court of appeals issued a published opinion relating to the use of tasers and the health risks involved in their use mitchell v city of warren  fed app p th cir aug   required the court to look into the involvement of a taser in the death of a  year old boy who suffered ventricular fibrillation and died after being shocked by a taser on appeal the sixth circuit decided that despite studies showing the possibility of an individual suffering from a cardiac episode after being shocked by a taser there was not enough evidence pointing to a definitive danger such that taser was effectively placed on notice and had a duty to warn of the danger and was negligent when it failed to do so while the decedent’s mother initially brought suit against the city of warren and the warren police department her claims against them were settled out of court after the settlement she amended her initial complaint to include counts against taser international mitchell argued that taser “negligently failed to warn endusers about the risk of cardiac arrest” from use of the taser product and that “the company’s training program negligent assured endusers that the device was safe when aimed at the chest” mitchell at  the district court held that taser international did not have a duty to warn the warren police department of any cardiac risks at the time of the sale of the tasers that it was not required under michigan law to warn the police department of any issues after the sale of the tasers that it had not assumed a duty to warn due to its training regimen and that mitchell could not prove that the officer would have seen any warning issued by taser even if it issued one the court of appeals in this case affirmed those findings the sixth circuit relied on the following michigan law relating to products liability in affirming the lower court’s ruling “in a product liability action brought against a manufacturer or seller for harm allegedly caused by a failure to provide adequate warning or instructions a manufacturer or seller is not liable unless the plaintiff proves that the manufacturer knew or should have known about the risk of harm based on the scientific technical or medical information reasonably available at the time the specific unit of the product left the control of the manufacturer” mitchell at  quoting mcl § emphasis added as it relates to this case the court determined that “any liability for failure to warn in this case thus would require a showing that taser ‘knew or should have known’ about the risk of cardiac arrest from an x chest shot based on the information available ‘at the time’ of sale – august  ” based on the evidence the court found that a jury could not have reasonably come to that conclusion mitchell at  the two studies referenced by mitchell in supporting her argument that taser international knew or should have known of the risks associated with its product according to the sixth circuit only illustrated a possibility that some sort of cardiac episode could take place as a result of the discharge of a taser the possibility of such an episode taking place is not enough to put a manufacturer on notice of a defect thus necessitating the need to warn of any associated dangers involving the product no direct connections could be made with regard to the use of a taser and ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest – the cause of death at issue in this case – for a number of reasons the one time it happened in one of the studies referenced by the court out of  attempts only took place because one of the test subjects a pig was given a shot of adrenaline to increase its heart rate – “none to the studies established to a reasonable level of certainty than an x poses a risk of cardiac arrest in humans” mitchell at  in addition in other instances where ventricular fibrillation happened the charge was set to  to  times higher than normal what does this mean it means that the speculative evidence was not enough for taser to have issued any warnings to entities that purchased its product including the city of warren and its police department further “it did not show any more than a possibility however that cardiac capture might cause ventricular fibrillation that could cause cardiac arrest robert mitchell died from cardiac arrest a jury may not speculate that a manufacturer should have known about one risk because a separately known risk revealed the mere possibility of the first we have refused to allow a jury to infer for example that injecting one type of fluid into a joint can cause harm from the mere fact that injecting other fluids can cause harm” mitchell at  internal citations omitted simply put possibility cannot be equated with probability
