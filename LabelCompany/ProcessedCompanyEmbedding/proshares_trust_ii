ii may   pm nyseboil nysekold ron rowland last friday may   proshares announced the suspension of creation units for eleven etfs  the ability to create and redeem shares is the primary characteristic of what makes an etf an etf  without the ability to create new shares there is not a method to keep the trading price aligned with the underlying net asset value  by definition they become broken products unfortunately regulators have not taken any steps to notify or warn investors about broken products  the simplest way would appear to be adding a suffix to the ticker symbol  this would prevent trades from being placed using the unaltered ticker symbol and investors would discover the broken conditions by way of the revised ticker symbol broken products essentially become closedend funds where price premiums and sometimes discounts can develop  this is not a problem for actual closedend funds as investors have been taught to expect these events  however this is extremely troublesome with etfs and etns because investors are conditioned to believe it cannot happen  in the most extreme case on record a  premium developed in elements mlcx gold etn former ticker goe when creations were halted and investors were not informed  investors were severely burned when the premium evaporated although regulators have failed to address this proshares is trying to warn investors and traders  the firm’s press release highlights some of the risks involved with broken products  the suspension of creation units is the result of delays in the effective date of a registration statement amendment and approval by the national futures association  additionally proshares believes the suspensions are temporary and expect to announce the resumption of creating shares soon the eleven affected etfs hold futures contracts and are proshares ultra djubs commodity ucd proshares ultrashort djubs commodity cmd proshares ultra djubs natural gas boil proshares ultrashort djubs
