to opportunity creation and recognition prior literature posits that effectuation is linked to opportunity creation when the ventures future is highly uncertain and causation to opportunity recognition when the entrepreneur perceives risk rather than uncertainty however such a linear approach towards opportunity generation offers limited explanation as to how entrepreneurs decide to

decisionmaking processes iterate over long periods of time to address this gap we employ the embedded case study method to investigate  decisions made by three scientistentrepreneurs commercializing platform biotechnology inventions we inductively derive a model of entrepreneurial decisionmaking which connects the environment to decisionmaking mode and opportunity generation our evidence reveals the iterative nature of opportunity generation and of decisionmaking modes as entrepreneurs respond to their evolving environment and to the level of regulatory and funding constraint such that entrepreneurs can shift from effectuation to causation remain in one particular mode or adopt a combination mode we also illustrate that effectuation does not always lead to opportunity creation

literature reveals a puzzling outcome in its empirical investigations on the science–technology relationship while many studies show the positive influence of a firm’s scientific capability on its technological performance a few others indicate that if a firm focuses its attention more on cutting edge science its overall technological performance will suffer we suggest that these findings can be reconciled by conceptualizing and measuring the scientific capability of the firm differently this paper attempts to demonstrate how different notions of scientific capability are associated with different performance outcomes furthermore a firm’s scientific capability facilitates the integration of new knowledge to produce valuable technologies when a firm broadens its search for new

the us local area network industry from  to  during the race to define a dominant design individual firms attract the suppliers of complements by building alliance networks to favor the firms’ preferred technology standard controlling for the number of suppliers in each technology standard community and the extent of technical progress achieved by individual firms the panel data analysis shows that central firms with high ego network density coupled with a strategic intent to acquire and share knowledge broadly within the technological community achieve better innovation performance the size of the technological community and some random events in the early formation of the industry do not provide a sufficient explanation of how these firms gain the diverse support of suppliers

scientists are complementary our findings suggest that the composition of a firm’s scientific human capital and its rd alliances interact in subtle ways to impact patent performance innovation

development has important implications on the firm’s research and development rd strategies however the current literature reveals a puzzling outcome in its empirical investigations on the science–technology relationship while many studies show the positive influence of a firm’s scientific capability on its technological performance a few others indicate that if a firm focuses its attention more on cutting edge science its overall technological performance will suffer we suggest that these findings can be reconciled by conceptualizing and measuring the scientific capability of the firm differently this paper attempts to demonstrate how different notions of scientific capability are associated with different performance outcomes furthermore a firm’s scientific capability facilitates the integration of new knowledge to produce valuable technologies when a firm broadens its search for new knowledge the paper highlights the nuances of conceptualizing and measuring the firm’s scientific capability in two different ways number of scientific publications and nonpatent references the findings also shed light on the mechanism through which science accelerates

study examines the performance implications of the alliance networks of  firms that competed for two technology standards in the us local area network industry from  to  during the race to define a dominant design individual firms attract the suppliers of complements by building alliance networks to favor the firms’ preferred technology standard controlling for the number of suppliers in each technology standard community and the extent of technical progress achieved by individual firms the panel data analysis shows that central firms with high ego network density coupled with a strategic intent to acquire and share knowledge broadly within the technological community achieve better innovation performance the size of the technological community and some random events in the early formation of the industry do not provide a sufficient explanation of how these firms gain the diverse support of suppliers or enhance their competitive advantage by demonstrating the independent and contingent effects of alliance network properties this study explains how network patterns might enhance or limit the benefits of alliance networks when focal firms embrace different innovation

suggests that mutual knowledge about market participants defines who will acquire potential information about opportunities to bring future products into existence building upon this argument this research investigates the role of networking alliances in information acquisition and its lagged effect on the new product performance of the firm by using a longitudinal analysis the study shows that

between internal research capability and external sources of innovation via interfirm networks while different partners bring with them different sets of resource opportunities the networks can serve as “pipes” of information via indirect partners this research examined whether the level of research capability moderates the performance impact of a firm’s network accessibility in terms of the number of technology partners and the firm’s centrality in the network interviews were also conducted with management executives and engineers to investigate the underlying motives and strategy of technology alliances while the statistical findings show that increasing research capability enhances the benefits of information access via centrality our interview data provide support that the role of good engineers as technology gatekeepers is critical to the success of leveraging partners’ resources building upon the rich qualitative data we conclude the study with an organizational framework of technology strategy this paper contributes to engineering management research by linking both strategic and organizational factors of research capability in acquiring external sources of innovation

abstractthis study investigates when indirect ties in which a referrer appears between an entrepreneur and a resource owner can enhance the likelihood of resource acquisitions for starting a new venture the authors argue that when either resource owners or referrers possess a greater level of prior knowledge about a venture’s technology or product information asymmetry problems arising from weak component ties decline enabling resource owners to evaluate the venture better on the basis of survey data from  hightech entrepreneurs the analysis shows that resource owners’ prior knowledge

substances nps – often referred to as ‘legal highs’ ‘designer drugs’ or ‘bath salts’ – presents an evolving challenge for toxicologists apart from the detection and identification of these compounds further analytical challenges may arise from the presence of possible metabolites or degradation products which may have to be considered when devising an analytical strategy whilst there has been some stability research for some more established drugs of abuse and medicinal products data on emerging nps are less abundant in order to address this need  nps mec mdai methoxetamine meodalt apb mpa
