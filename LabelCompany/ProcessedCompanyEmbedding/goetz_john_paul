john c goetz direct dial  email jgoetzschwebelcom years in practice  download vcard printable resume areas of practice personal injury wrongful death products liability medical malpractice paralegal  tei kano legal secretary  peggy larkin i like to help people who deserve help i also like to use my skills as a lawyer to fight for what is right for my clients for these reasons i find it very gratifying to represent individuals and families who have suffered injuries and deaths through no fault of their own and will not receive fair treatment in the legal process unless they have a good attorney on their side after more than  years of representing hundreds of injury victims in minnesota and neighboring states i understand the legal and medical issues that are involved in a wide variety of cases medical malpractice motor vehicle collisions defective products and many others because of the success that i and my firm have had over the years we are respected by the lawyers and insurance companies who oppose us in these cases we can often obtain successful settlements without trial that attorneys with less experience and reputation would not be able to obtain to me one of the greatest satisfactions of being a lawyer is the appreciation of someone i was able to help at a difficult time in their life over the years i have been grateful to receive letters from clients with comments such as this one from a young mother whose husband was electrocuted by an unprotected power company transformer thank you for working so hard and unselfishly to secure a future for paige and i it is easy to see why you are so successful it is clear to me that you are about a lot more than business behind all the huge folders and legal wangling is a man with a strong sense of value and character my background is as follows i was born and raised in minneapolis and have lived there all of my life i attended the university of minnesota for both my undergraduate bachelor of arts suma cum laude and my law degree magna cum laude and editor of the minnesota law review i teamed up with jim schwebel in  i am certified as a civil trial specialist by the minnesota state bar association i
