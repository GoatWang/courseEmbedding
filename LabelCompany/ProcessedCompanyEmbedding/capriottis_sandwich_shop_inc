capriottis sandwich shop by ashley morris ceo of capriottis may    am est more credit courtesy of capriottis our small business snapshot series features photos that represent in just one image what the small businesses we feature are all about ashley morris ceo of capriottis sandwich shop inc explains how this image represents his business founded in  capriottis is an awardwinning sandwich shop that remains true to their year tradition of slowroasting whole all natural turkeys inhouse every day for their signature subs the concept originated in delaware by yearold lois margolet and her brother together they sought to create a sandwich for real turkey lovers – and began roasting whole fresh turkeys overnight this concept sets them apart from their competition people loved their sandwiches from the start and word spread about their fresh roasted turkey quality meats and cheeses fresh rolls and produce they serve a variety of classic flavors but their signature item is a bobbie sandwich which is made with slowroasted turkey cranberry sauce homemade stuffing and a hint of mayonnaise on a freshly baked roll this photo of the original location in little italy in wilmington delaware is a perfect representation of the capriottis brand for two reasons first the success of the brand stems from the success seen in the early days back in little italy sandwich shops were abundant in that area but margolet had a dream of creating something unique –something so undeniably good that would stand apart from the rest her idea met success because of its difference in approach and it is something that still resonates with consumers today secondly the photo represents the family origins of capriottis the shop began as a boardedup building beneath margolets apartment and was named after their grandfather philip capriotti who loved to cook when i took over the brand it was always my goal to maintain that family feel my association with capriottis first began in  when i fell in love at first bite my absolute favorite being the chicken cheesesteak i broke a lease to live closer to one of the locations and then eventually went on to buy my first location then three then the whole franchise i put my  plus years of experience in the finance industry to good use and officially joined as chief executive officer in  one of the biggest challenge capriottis faces is access to great real estate with the economy continuing to grow there are many new businesses that are competing for the same limited real estate and as far as where the brand is headed were continuing to focus on national growth in january  we added david bloom to the company as our chief development officer bringing more than  years of franchise experience we knew hed be the perfect person to help elevate capriottis to the next level currently we receive  to  inquiries weekly from prospective franchisees and are slated to open  new shops in   in  and  the following year – exponentially growing to a location projection by  edited for brevity and clarity by sammi caramela you may also like small business snapshot dang foods small business snapshot organic kids la small
