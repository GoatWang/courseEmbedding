extreme northeastern corner of the state and graduated with my high school class of  students in  the great new york yankees outfielder mickey mantle number  graduated from commerce high  years ahead of medue to one of my great aunt’s affiliation with the eagle picher lead and zinc mining and smelting company upon graduation i received a scholarship to attend what was then oklahoma am university now oklahoma state university in stillwater oklahoma i and three boyhood friends finding ourselves in similar straits of no clue as to what we should do consulted the dean of northeastern oklahoma am community college in miami six miles south of commerce when confronted with the blank faces of four confused young male high school graduates to be he suggested “why don’t you boys enroll as engineering majors” which we didi enrolled at the community college for  years in order to make up deficiencies in math that would be required for transfer as an engineering major to oklahoma am in the meantime a second great aunt who was a physician began talking to me about studying medicine leland keller phd professor of biology at what was then kansas state college of pittsburg now pittsburg state university was the premed director with a reputation for success in guiding his advisees to medical school admission at either the university of kansas or the university of oklahoma pittsburg state was  miles from commerce oklahoma so i drove there and managed to gain an appointment with dr kellerleland e keller phdleland keller embellished his academic functions with a passion for collection and hording of antique medical devices after retirement from his faculty job he became curator of the leland keller museum of science and quackery which still shows up on a google search following the interview with dr keller i enrolled at pittsburg state received a bachelor’s degree in  and master of science degree in doctor keller was my academic advisor during the years at pitt state he was a physiologist and director of two physiology courses each of which had two “wet” h labs per week i was his graduate assistant for  years in handson student physiology laboratories covering systems such as skeletal muscle preparations removed from frogs or preparations in living turtles demonstrating physiological and pharmacologic aspects of vagal control of the heart i remain convinced that dedicated students learn physiology which is basic to medicine most effectively through handling and study of live tissues and organsamong dr keller’s scientific interests was investigation of the neurophysiology of “simple” invertebrate nervous systems he maintained in the laboratory two species of large cockroaches periplaneta americana and blaberus giganteus i learned from him how to record with microelectrodes from the cockroaches’ terminal abdominal ganglion neuronal cell bodies in this ganglion receive sensory input from the cerci which underlies the typical escape behavior seen in cockroaches sensory nerves in the hairs of the cerci which are fired when distorted by slight movement of the surrounding air or by substrate vibration send axons that synaptically connect with the giant interneurons in the terminal abdominal ganglion the information is processed by central synaptic circuitry that in milliseconds initiates running behavior i studied electrical activity in the terminal ganglion as part of the research i did for my master of science degree the title of my master’s thesis was the action of nicotine in the arthropod nervous systemalthough dr keller encouraged application to either medical school or a phd program i applied for admission to the phd program in physiology and biophysics at the university of illinois champaignurbana my attraction to illinois was the presence of prof c ladd prosser on the facultyc ladd prosser phd dsc honc ladd prosser was a world authority on “simple” invertebrate nervous systems his textbook of comparative animal physiology continues to be a classic i was accepted into the phd program in may  and accepted by prof prosser as one of his graduate students in the same yeari shared an office with eight of ladd’s graduate students on the th floor of burrill hall on the university of illinois campus one day ladd walked into our office and handed me a reprint from pflügers archges physiol on the enteric nervous system ens the article was from a japanese investigator who described electrophysiologic records that were interpreted to be action potentials recorded from ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of rabbit small intestine  the action potentials were greater than  ms in duration and ladd thought they were smooth muscle action potentials not from ens neurons he said to me “jack because you have experience recording from insect neurons i suggest you have a go at recording from the neurons inside the wall of the intestine” he went on to say that no one had ever recorded electrical activity from ens neurons with a large smile he said “neuronal cell bodies in the ganglia are like bunches of grapes and should be a piece of cake for you” i recall this statement as one of the rare occasions when he was mistaken in fact we now know that the ens is a twodimensional array of flat disklike neurons sandwiched between the longitudinal and circular muscle coats and between the circular muscle coats and the mucosa of most regions of the gut unlike other autonomic ganglia the cell bodies of the ganglion cells are not in grapelike clusters they lie edgetoedge like a single layer of coins placed in a twodimensional plane otherwise ladd was correct recording from the ens neurons turned out not to be a real problem for meladd was involved in an ongoing international and sometimes rancorous debate on physiology of gastrointestinal smooth muscle at the time of my entry into his laboratory the debate dealt with whether or not smooth muscle fibers in the tunica muscularis were electrically coupled one with another by gap junctions to form functional electrical syncytia as in cardiac muscle cat small intestine was the model used in the laboratory by ladd’s postdocs and graduate students for investigation of smooth muscle electrophysiology as well as contractile mechanics with availability of fresh cat intestine i designed and built in the department’s machine shop a lucite recording chamber to maintain cat small intestinal preparations at body temperature in physiological media i started recording with one or the other of two types of microelectrodes platinum–iridium glass capillaries or electrolytically sharpened insulated steel both with tips in the range of – µm neuronal electrical activity was amplified by a tektronix type  preamplifier displayed on a tektronix a oscilloscope and monitored on a loudspeaker continuous records were photographed with a grass model c camerapractice was required to become reasonably skilled at microdissecting the intestinal wall to obtain preparations with a satisfactorily appearing myenteric plexus for electrophysiologic recording finally the day came when i had my very first preparation setup in the tissue bath the first time i touched the microelectrode tip to the surface of a ganglion i heard on the loudspeaker and saw on the oscilloscope the spontaneous discharge of action potentials that did not differ much from what i recorded in kansas cockroaches this was the first time electrophysiologic recording of neural discharge from neurons in the ens had been done or at least reported in the literature it “kickedoff” for me what has been a satisfying career of investigation of the neurophysiology and neuropharmacology of the ens which continues at the time of this writing the paper was published in the american journal of physiology in   ladd insisted that i be listed as the sole author on the papergetting the first paper on the ens published did not go well and was discouraging for me as a budding investigator professor mollie holman at monash university in south australia reviewed the paper for the american journal of physiology and rejected it because she could not accept that spontaneous neuronal discharge occurred in autonomic ganglia she evaluated the neuronal firing as an artifact fortunately for me she did not have sufficient prestige to challenge ladd when he came to my defense and the paper was accepted later in  mollie and i were at a smooth muscle meeting on hayman island in queensland australia during a reception she walked up to me and said “jackie you were right and i was wrong about spontaneous neuronal discharge in enteric ganglia i will apologize by escorting you to the bar and shouting you a beer”williams collegebecause i wanted to continue research on the ens and there were few if any established laboratories in the usa or elsewhere with ens neurophysiologic expertise i forewent a postdoc and accepted a position at the rank of assistant professor in the department of biology at williams college in williams town massachusetts in  the physiologist in the department was samuel a matthews phd he was the samuel fessenden clarke professor of biology at the timei was finishing my dissertation when ladd stepped into the small electrically shielded room where i recorded from neurons and said “sam matthews at williams college called a few minutes ago to ask my advice on recruitment of his replacement as the department of biology plans for his retirement” sam matthews and ladd were old friends through ladd’s annual pilgrimage to his summer home in woods hole massachusetts and research laboratory at the woods hole marine biological laboratory as was ladd’s habit he squinted at my preparation twiddled a couple of knobs on my oscilloscope and said as he walked out “williams is the top one or two liberal arts colleges in the country you should consider applying for the physiology position there” i got the job and moved to williams town in the summer of i found reserved for me a totally satisfactory laboratory startup funding and colorfully painted office space in the thompson biology building when i arrived at williams my teaching assignment was a one semester systems and organs physiology course and a one semester course on cellular and comparative physiology both with handson animal laboratoriessam matthews left me a great legacy of equipment for the student teaching labs and for that matter research including new chart recorders amplifiers strain gages and electronic stimulators generously donated by mrs ellen r grass of the grass instruments co in quincy ma my experience as a physiology laboratory teaching assistant with leland keller in undergrad courses and a nsffunded summer course for high school teachers as well as a physiology teaching assistant at the university of illinois made laboratory teaching in my first year at williams straightforward and enjoyable moreover i had a talented cadre of senior premed students as assistantsmy teaching load at williams was moderate because the college expected faculty to do research and publish i was never pressured by william c grant the chair to obtain grant funding nevertheless i learned at the university of illinois that a young faculty member like me who wanted to do research must have success in obtaining grant support from national funding agencies such as the national institutes of health or the national science foundationmy first research grant submitted from williams college was entitled function of the enteric nervous system and was funded by the national science foundation in mid the grant money enabled support for premed students to obtain research experience in my laboratoryi found the premed students at williams to be exceptionally bright and outstanding young men williams was not coed when i arrived however i had women in the classroom as exchange students from other quality new england liberal arts colleges including vassar wellesley and mount holyoke many of the male students were enrolled in an honors program which required completion and defense of a research thesis some of these students worked and published with me on the nsf grant   nevertheless continuity of experienced hands in the laboratory was less than ideal because i generally had the students only for no more than a year before they were off to medical school this became a factor in my decision to move to the university of kansas school of medicine and medical center in kansas city kansasuniversity of kansas medical centerbefore the annual meeting of the american gastroenterological association and digestive diseases week grew to its present prominence the major national meeting for gutrelated science was the faseb meeting federation of american societies for experimental biology held annually in the spring in atlantic city new jersey a williams college honors student and i were manning two posters at the  faseb meeting when earnest b brown jr the chair of physiology at the university of kansas medical center approached had a look at the posters and asked if i might be interested in a position in the department of physiology at the university of kansas he invited me to come for a visit because kansas city was closer to home and the offer was attractive i accepted the job and was appointed assistant professor in the department of physiology in  my research and teaching of medical students went well there and i was promoted quickly through the academic ranks to professor in i gained my first experience in teaching physiology to firstyear medical students in the first year at the ku med center i used the opportunity to impress on the students that physiology is basic to medicine and understanding of how a system works normally is necessary for understanding what can go wrong obtaining a diagnosis and development of a rational strategy for treatmenti gained a genuine understanding of the meaning of “rock chalk jayhawk” although i went to football games in memorial stadium on the main campus of the university of kansas in lawrence kansas kansas football was a bit lacking the “big red horde” from the university of nebraska and from the university of oklahoma would consistently embarrass the jayhawks however it was a different story for kansas basketball the team went to the final four during my first year at kansas and in – before i left to accept a job at the university of nevada getting tickets for kansas football was easy getting tickets for basketball in allen fieldhouse on the main ku campus in lawrence kansas was noti relished the teaching of medical students and apparently did it well because i received the university of kansas chancellor’s award including a  honorarium for excellence in teaching in  and a second teaching award in  presented by the medical class of  research also went well as reflected by two major rlevel grants from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk one was for study of congenital megacolon in mice and a second was titled function of the enteric nervous systemthe congenital megacolon grant enabled my students and me to advance concepts of ens neuropathy in hirschsprung’s disease        discoveries with the hirschsprung’s model prompted the mantra “the gut does not work well if something is wrong in the ens and does not work at all if the ens is gone” the other grant for study of the function of the ens received funding in  and has been competitively renewed at the end of each year cycle up to  moreover while at the university of kansas med ctr i received a year nih career development award in – for support of ens researchthe s were prosperous times for nih research funding with pay lines somewhere around the th percentile sarah kalser the program director at niddk actually telephoned and suggested that my productivity made me a qualified applicant and that i should apply for a career development award i was not aware and neither was the kansas med ctr administration of this category of nih awards now commonly known as “k” awards combined with a fellowship from the alexander von humboldt foundation in west germany the nih career development award enabled  years of fulltime research at the physiological institute of the ludwig maximilian university of munich in germanyi worked at the physiological institute in – during the “cold war” which divided germany into the deutsche demokratische republik ddr in the east and the bundesrepublik deutschland in the west at the time it was a policy of the alexander von humboldt foundation to creatively introduce humboldt fellows to germany during my first  months in germany i was required to brush up my german in a goethe language institute in grafing stadt which was about a min sbahn ride outside of munich at the end of the goethe language course a busload of other fellows and i including one other american were accompanied by a bavarian driver and a graduate student guide from düsseldorf on a thirteencity twoweek tour of germany including the ddr and east berlin i readily admit that crossing the berlin wall at checkpoint charlie from the american sector into the soviet sector of berlin was an emotional experience that brought back childhood impressions of world war iia relationship existed at the time between the west german military bundeswehr and west german universities what’s more my first postdoctoral fellow claus j mayer dr med was a first lieutenant in the bundeswehr although he anticipated retirement as a general he retired as a colonel in  due to the necessity of integration of east german officers following the fall of the berlin wall in i was invited to present a paper on the ens during the xxv international union of physiological sciences congress held in munich in  as well as a lecture in the physiological institute of the university of munich i met claus mayer and dr med jürgen riemer one of his peers during my visit to the institute they were much interested in my visit because they were attempting to record from neurons in the ens and not having successclaus mayer’s commanding officer determined and i agreed that he should visit my laboratory he was given the orders and arrived in kansas city in  my laboratory was well acquainted with nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission in the ens which translated for the bundeswehr into interest in nonreversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitors in warfareclaus mayer remains one of my closest personal and professional friends his “boss” in  was a general in the german airforce luftwaffe because german military pilots and air defense weapons specialists received training at fort bliss in el paso texas and george airforce base in victorville california and because mcdonald douglas f phantom fighter planes were constructed in st louis missouri claus and i were able to travel free on cargo flights between cologne germany and airports in el paso washington dc and saint louis in the usa this enabled our work together in my laboratory in kansas city and his laboratory at the physiological institute in munich to continue for several years the collaboration was exceptionally productive resulting in a number of seminal papers on electrical and synaptic behavior of ens neurons that included the discovery of serotonin as a neurotransmitter for slow synaptic excitatory neurotransmission in the ens           university of nevada school of medicinein  i received an inquiry from the university of nevada school of medicine describing their recruitment efforts for a chair of their department of physiology the school of medicine was reorganizing into a year program in reno nevada in order to avoid export of their medical students to other western university programs for the final  years of medical school after three visits to reno i took the job in the seventh international symposium on gastrointestinal motility was held in iowa city iowa on september – in  claus mayer used a luftwaffe cargo flight to cross the atlantic and join me at the meeting we contributed a paper to the meeting on comparison of the action of hydroxytryptamine and substance p on intracellularly recorded electrical activity of myenteric neurons  at the end of the meeting we traveled on to reno where claus remained for  months in order to help set up the ens laboratoryan appealing aspect of the job in reno was the prospect for setting up a new department oriented to the neurobiology of the gut i did so by recruiting faculty who shared my research interest in what is recognized as a subspecialty of gastroenterology now identified as neurogastroenterology   the faculty included helen j cooke neurogenic secretion richard c rogers central nervous control kenton m sanders smooth muscleinterstitial cells of cajal nelson publicover smooth muscle gerlinda hermann central nervous control the dean appointed me chair of the search committee that led to hiring of david p westfall phd from the university of west virginia as chair of the pharmacology department with dave westfall and his faculty recruits in place collaborative basic research related to the gut and autonomic nervous system flourished each member of the physiology department received rlevel funding from the nih my r on function of the enteric nervous system was competitively renewed for five more years as well as a second r on presynaptic receptors in peripheral ganglia which was funded after my arrival at the university of nevada fig open image in new windowfig jackie “jack” d wood at work in his laboratory in reno nevada in an attractive pleasurerelated aspect of the job in reno was the western environment it appeared to me as if a master architect had drawn a line separating nevada and california with spectacular sierra nevada mountains and an alpine environment to the west and a desert environment to the east i perfected my skiing abilities on the slopes surrounding lake tahoe in winter and explored the abandoned “ghost” mining towns with a rented wheel drive suv on an occasional weekend during summer i also made a few h trips over donner pass to san francisco in fact after my departure from the university of nevada kenton sanders who succeeded me as the chair of physiology appointed me to the advisory committee for an nih program project grant that received funding kent always scheduled the advisory board meetings and my trips to reno during ski season it was satisfying for me that the reno program project grant on gastrointestinal smooth muscle was renewed last year to begin its th yearthe ohio state universityearnest l mazzaferri sr md was recruited to the university of nevada reno from the ohio state university college of medicine as chair of internal medicine during conversion of the medical school to a year program ernie and i had research laboratories on the same floor of the anderson medical sciences building and became close friends after my arrival in  he was recruited back to ohio state as the chair of internal medicineone night my bedside phone rang at  am it was ernie mazzaferri he apologized for overlooking the h time difference and went on to tell me that the ohio state university college of medicine was initiating a search for a chairman of the department of physiology and encouraged me to apply the abridged story is that i visited a few times eventually accepted the job and moved to columbus ohio in since ohio had no desert abandoned ghost towns or comparable ski slopes fun for me revolved around becoming a “buckeye” and supporting ohio state football and basketball it has been great fun as the football team won national championships in  and  attending a game with  fans in ohio stadium is something to be experienced basketball has not been bad either with three final four appearancesthe ohio state department of physiology had  fully funded faculty positions when i arrived the department had responsibility for teaching professional students in the college of medicine college of dentistry college of nursing college of optometry and school of allied medical professionsnumbers of faculty research grants in the department of physiology fell well below national norms in  this was an issue for the college of medicine administration and was reflected by a statement in my letter of offer which among other details addressed the research deficiency as a priority i was able to negotiate positions at ohio state for all members of the reno group helen cooke richard rogers and gerlinda hermann moved with me to ohio along with three postdoctoral fellows and one phd student neither kenton sanders nor nelson publicover ended up accepting positions at ohio state sanders replaced me as chair in reno and continues at present to lead a highly productive nationally and internationally recognized departmenti stepped down as the chair of physiology at ohio state in  at which time grant funding had increased to eighteen nih funded rlevel grants in the department i remained at ohio state as a professor involved in research teaching and local national and international service on too many boards and committees to mentioni enjoy teaching of medical students but found the experience at ohio state rather different from that at the university of nevada mainly in that class size is about  students compared with only  in nevada where i was personally acquainted with every student on a first name basis in the ohio state medical class i know very few students by their first name nevertheless i received a merit award  that recognized excellence in research and teaching in the ohio state university college of medicine in contributions to digestive sciencethe dissertation for fulfillment of the requirements for my master of science degree was a study of the neurophysiology of an insect central nervous system insight gained from the work on the “simple” nervous system led to my realization and continuous promotion of the fact that the heuristic model for the ens like invertebrate nervous systems is that of an independent integrative nervous system my first published study of the ens was done at the marine biological laboratory in woods hole ma i had accompanied dr prosser on his annual visit to the marine biological laboratory in woods hole ma which at the time was a mecca for study of the neurophysiology of independent integrative nervous systems research done at woods hole resulted in my first paper titled electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the stomach of the squid loligo pealei  the paper describes remarkable similarities between cephalopod and mammalian gastrointestinal tracts in terms of physiology of the smooth muscle and ens neural control of motility i concluded that expression of like physiological characteristics between cephalopods and mammals reflects parallel evolution of two digestive systems in vastly different animals under very similar selective pressures squid living in the ocean evolved into pelagic carnivores from molluscan filter feeders such as mussels clams and oysters under selective evolutionary pressures that were much the same as took place in the evolutionary history of carnivorous mammals on landthe next paper in  was the first to describe the electrical behavior of neurons in the cat ens  in  in view of rapidly emerging evidence that the ens expressed independent neurophysiologic properties akin to the mammalian brain and spinal cord i coined the now universally accepted term braininthegut in a review in the  annual review of physiology early on my laboratory team demonstrated the fundamental importance of inhibitory musculomotor neurons in the ens we were first to show that subpopulations of ens inhibitory musculomotor neurons were spontaneously firing an important function of which is continuous suppression of the autogenous behavior of the smooth musculature the work established the concept that the various patterns of intestinal motility are dependent on integrated disinhibition of the intestinal circular muscle coat in the normally functioning bowel integration of the activity of inhibitory motor neurons determines four key events first of which is whether or not an electrical slow wave triggers a contractile response in the intestinal circular muscle coat secondly neurogenic inhibitory control decides the force of the contractile response triggered by an electrical slow wave thirdly the distance over which muscle action potentials and associated contractions spread from muscle fiber to fiber via the gap junctions that underlie the electrical syncytial properties of the smooth muscle is determined by integrated control of firing of inhibitory musculomotor neurons fourthly turning on and off of inhibitory motor neurons determines direction of spread of action potentials and associated contractions along a segment which can be in the oral or aboral direction according to the motility patternour investigation of inhibitory musculomotor neurons led us to discard the dogma that the constricted terminal segment and megacolon in hirschsprung’s disease reflected overgrowth of cholinergic innervation in the aganglionic terminal segment instead we showed that the constricted terminal segment resulted from myogenic contractile activity in the congenital absence of the ens and its population of inhibitory musculomotor neurons these data are published in  peerreviewed journals    teams in my laboratory were the first to demonstrate the fundamental importance of ens secretomotor neurons in terms of neurogenic control of glandular secretion of nacl ho and hco translational significance of these discoveries are firstly any condition that elevates excitability of secretomotor neurons leads to a diarrheal state eg infectious diarrhea and second conditions in which excitability of secretomotor neurons is suppressed lead to constipation eg opioidinduced constipation our data on neurogenic secretion are published in  peerreviewed journals     in early collaboration with claus mayer in munich my laboratory was first to describe slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials slow epsps in the ens we identified  the receptors for slow epsps  morphologies of neurons expressing the receptors  intraneuronal signal transduction cascades for slow epsps  membrane channels involved  neuronal expression of excitatory receptors for paracrine mediators released from enteric immuneinflammatory cells such as histamine and mast cell proteases we published multiple papers on the cellular biology of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ipsps in the ens our data on neurotransmission are published in over  peerreviewed journals       owen c peck mdin the late s my group began investigation of inflammatory bowel disease our attention to ulcerative colitis was motivated by owen c peck md who had moved to the university of nevada school of medicine in reno from his position in internal medicine at the palo alto clinic in southern california in  owen had a sustained interest in inflammatory bowel disease that projected back to his time on the staff of the palo alto clinic and two famous patients that received treatment there one was the nobel laureate and pioneering nuclear scientist earnest lawrence the other was edward teller a hungarianborn american theoretical physicist who has been referred to as “the father of the hydrogen bomb” both of the famous scientists suffered from ulcerative colitis exacerbation of which owen felt was related to stressful life eventsas an undergraduate owen attended the university of kansas where he was an all star basketball player for the famous kansas coach phog allen aside from his reputation as a winning coach phog allen was also trained as a doctor of osteopathic medicine after basketball owen was admitted to medical school at the university of kansas he attributes his career in medicine to phog allen who was colloquially called “doc”after i was ensconced in reno owen would show up unannounced in my office and ask “jack what do you know about ulcerative colitis” my reply would be “very little” but if you would like to study it effectively an animal model will be essential”while at an nih study section meeting in bethesda md i learned of a meeting focused on inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer in a nonhuman primate model that was to be held at oak ridge associated universities in oak ridge tennessee in  i mentioned the meeting to owen his response was a typical “i will go” he went and upon return to reno could not wait to tell me that the meeting was focused on a monkey that developed spontaneous colitis and appeared to be the model we were looking for proceedings of the oak ridge meeting were published with the title is the marmoset an experimental model for the study of gastrointestinal disease in digestive diseases and sciences as a supplement vol  number  it so happened at the time that a colony of thirty marmosets now officially classified as tamarins was being studied for reasons other than inflammatory bowel disease at texas am university in college station texas the investigators in texas had finished their work and were looking to liquidate the colony financed by donations from owen’s patients in reno we acquired the monkeys at the time i was in the process of moving to the ohio state university where we housed the colony of tamarinswork on the colony of tamarins was funded at first by a seed grant from ohio state and later by an nih rlevel grant we terminated the work on cottontop tamarins in  when the nih did not renew the grantmost of the evidence obtained from our studies of the only known nonhuman primate model for spontaneous colitis and colon cancer supported a hypothesis of a braingut connection in colitis      severe colitis was found in – percent of the tamarins in the ohio state colony during semiannual colonoscopically obtained biopsies we found colitis in biopsies from young tamarins at  months of age when the colon could first be accessed with mm pediatric endoscopes as the animals aged we would begin to find lowgrade dysplasia highgrade dysplasia and eventually cancer which became obstructivewith a desire to learn if there might be a genetic predisposition to colitis in the cottontop tamarin model we managed to capture and obtain colonoscopic biopsies from cottontop tamarins living wild in their natural habitat in colombia sa as we were planning the work i was concerned that the wild tamarins might have some form of infectious colitis that we would be unable to distinguish from ulcerative colitis however we never found any indications of colitis in biopsies removed from over  wildliving tamarins in the midst of the work on wildcaught tamarins we made a serendipitous discovery of severe colitis in each of  cottontop tamarins held in outside cages at frigid nighttime temperatures in a zoo in cali colombia sa all indications of colitis elevated immune cells crypt abscesses mucous depletion etc subsided after transfer from the cali zoo environment to their natural tropical habitat in northern colombia this led us to suggest that stress was a factor in the initiation and progression of colitis to cancer in the tamarin modelin testing a hypothesis that substance p released from spinal sensory afferents triggered colitis we found that twicedaily oral dosing with a nonpeptide neurokinin antagonist suppressed the acute inflammatory response in the colon of cottontop tamarins when the tamarins were removed from their natural habitat to the colitisinducing environment of the zoo in caliour general working hypothesis continues to be that a brain–mast cell connection is involved in the initiation of colitis physical or emotional stress degranulates enteric mast cells to release simultaneously both chemical signals to the enteric nervous system and chemical factors that attract influx of inflammatory cellsduring the course of the work on triggers for intestinal inflammation we discovered mechanisms by which spinal afferent innervation degranulates enteric mast cells to release inflammatory mediators that feedback and sensitize the afferent terminals to their various stimuli as well as actions of clostridium difficile toxin   we suggested that this form of sensitization of enteric sensory nerves might be a significant factor in visceral pain syndromespharmaceutical industrythroughout most of my career i have shared my knowledge of the ens and the investigative skills of my teams of students and postdoctoral fellows in collaborative ventures with the pharmaceutical industry with an objective of understanding mechanisms of actions of drugs in the context of development of treatments for functional gastrointestinal disorders drugs we have worked on in this category include cisapride propulsid® tegaserod zelnorm® alosetron lotronex® and lubiprostone amitiza®   conclusionsthree important factors enabled my success in teaching of physiology in academia and the progressive lifelong advancement of my scientific productivity in relation to the ens first was the quality of the education training and handson experience i received at kansas state university of pittsburg and university of illinois champaignurbana second was the outstanding character and talent of the colleagues students and graduate fellows i have been privileged to work with in the laboratory third has been  years of support
