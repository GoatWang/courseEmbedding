a show in los angeles it was a prestigious club and it was big deal for us as is often the case with these shows we had to guarantee a certain number of people we knew it would be tight because we hadn’t played la enough to build a local audience and our local mailing list as in “postal” mailing list was pretty small but we put the word out to everyone we knew and crossed our fingers when the time came for us to go on the sound man stopped us on our way to the stage he told us we were just short of the audience guarantee i think it was  people and the manager was pulling us it was a humiliating moment we had driven  miles brought a bunch of fans and now we were being told we couldn’t play that moment captured for me the awful challenge that working musicians face you lug a truck

company went through some tough times  tim westergren the pandora cofounder survived on maxedout credit cards and sheer willpower westergren recounted tales of those early “not glamorous” days during a talk at today’s hustle con event in san francisco the cash crunch  in the run up to its  series b funding pandora was running on financial fumes pandora wasn’t able to pay its employees for an astounding two years between  to  while it worked on producing a viable commercial product not paying fulltime employees is very very illegal in california where pandora is based “we had no idea we were breaking the law westergren said over that period pandora accumulated  million in back wages owed westergren himself ran up a  debt on maxedout cards while he paid bills and as many salaries as he could afford  he paid a little at a time in the order they were due an experience he describes as like playing tetris with his finances which he doesnt recommend  two employees sued for back wages and pandoras original model of licensing out its internet music recommendation engine to retailers and labels wasnt working out  but westergren a musician by training who had little to fall back on if he defaulted on the debts managed to keep most of the team together to keep employees motivated he gave speeches upon speeches encouraging them that the potential market was huge and so was pandoras potential impact on music and culture  somehow — westergren says hes not sure how — the company was able to close a  million round of funding in  when money was much harder to come by than it is today  westergren called an allhands meeting for everybody in pandora that same day everybody was expecting another stirring speech he says instead he pulled a stack of envelopes from his back pocket and paid out the  million among the  employees right then and there  everybody thought it was a bad joke like it would bounce or something westergren says the beatles  bee gees connection  there was another scary moment earlier in pandora’s life shortly before the dotcom bubble burst in  westergren said  pandora founders will glaser jon kraft and westergren had spent the last year and a lot of money on their socalled music genome project an algorithm that would predict what music listeners would want based on suggestions you put in now it was ready for its first test  the founders put in a song by the beatles four or five minutes later he says it returned with a song by the bee gees — a pop group that couldnt be further from the fab four  we were like oh f westergren said  but on further investigation it turned out it was an early song by the bee gees from when they were a clone of the beatles westergren said it worked just in mysterious ways we went from despair to elation in a very short period of time westergren said nowadays pandora is a publicallytraded company since  and westergren himself is building a massive vacation home  see also the linkedin hack that turned a

research grouplens research movielens netflix prize v t e the music genome project was first conceived by will glaser and tim westergren in late  in january  they joined forces with jon kraft to found savage beast technologies to bring their idea to market the music genome project is an effort to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level using over  attributes to describe songs and a complex mathematical algorithm to organize them the music genome project is currently made up of  subgenomes poprock hiphopelectronica jazz world music and classical under the direction of nolan gasser and a team of musicological experts the initial attributes were later refined and extended a given song is represented by a vector containing values for approximately  genes analogous to traitdetermining genes for organisms in the field of genetics each gene corresponds to a characteristic of the music for example gender of lead vocalist prevalent use of groove level of distortion on the electric guitar type of background vocals etc rock and pop songs have  genes rap songs have  and jazz songs have approximately  other genres of music such as world and classical music have – genes the system depends on a sufficient number of genes to render useful results each gene is assigned a number between  and  in halfinteger increments the music genome projects database is built using a methodology that includes the use of precisely defined terminology a consistent frame of reference redundant analysis and ongoing quality control to ensure that data integrity remains reliably high given the vector of one or more songs a list of other similar songs is constructed using what the company calls its matching algorithm each song is analyzed by a musician in a process that takes  to  minutes per song ten percent of songs are analyzed by more than one musician to ensure conformity with the inhouse standards and statistical reliability the music genome project was developed in its entirety by pandora media and remains the core technology used to program its online radio stations in response to its users desires although there was a time when the company licensed this technology

closer by cage the elephant which was the first song ever replayed on pandora it seems appropriate for today that band has two and a half million unique listeners so that added their station to pandora and in just last weekend weve got  new listeners at a station which is more than the instagram followers facebook likers twitter followers and youtube subscribers combined so in just one week theyve added a large audience on pandora that was the pretty impressive information so ill reiterate that palmeras thanks for probably out time and this is earnings week we knew its a busy week for everyone and were asking a lot as you come and take time with us but even so we thought it was really important for us to set us by the time as we as the company goes through a pretty profound transformation both in product and in our business to really kind of open the kimono for you all talk about the opportunity how were going to tackle it and really dive in deep on the business model so we hope that this will be an informative day for you and have plenty of time for questions at the end so thanks again for taking the time today we really appreciate it so just like a quick recap of pandora  years ago we created something brand new never been done before the first taxonomical approach of music recommendation the music genome prospect which was our hand built database manually detailing musical and logical information about songs that really was the most precise and continues to be the most precise and continues to be the most precise way to connect music it requires an immense investment we spent about five years investing in that product refining algorithms perfecting the music analysis and really developing a very robust methodology for recommending songs most notably genome is the only form of music recommendation that is blind its a popularity so you recommend songs based on how they sound that mix pandora uniquely positioned for music discovery which i think youll see today and ongoing the big part of sort of theme that pandora that i think makes it very attractive and enduring service for listeners we spent five years building that technology and then finally launched our consumerfacing products in the fall  pandoracom it was claim to say pandoracom now but it just took off like a rocket shift from the day we launched it a thousands of people from day one within a weeks tens of thousands and without barely a diamond marketing we reached a couple of hundred million registered listeners in the us alone really all by word of mouth and i think the reason that pandora grew so fast as pretty simple although its a very complex problem solved we offer for the first time a service that was deeply and precisely personalized it was also easy to use that combination of easy to use and personalized is phenomenally hard easy had existed before broadcast radio hit a button music comes out personalized has existed before i think for cd collection mp collection growing subscription services that give you kind of ubiquitous access to massive catalogue you can write manually create your experience you could think about is very very totally personalized but very time consuming difficult to use and we really think not but consumer ultimately want pandora puts us together one song one artist and we delivered immediately a listening experience that combine music that you knew and loved and also played songs you never heard before and it worked and they grew entirely by word of mouth we were accelerated of course by the smartphone revolution that struck in the summer of  we rode that ways from phones into connected devices until the service grew to be a gigantic service of today during that time we brought equal focus to monetization and that become world class i think best in the world and making money off of audio streams again a fantastically difficult task weve invested in enormous technology stack to do that and in recruiting training and deploying hundreds of sellers both digital sellers and broadcast alumnis that have come over from msn side to help us tackle in the local market so we have really perfected and invested in that the product and the monetization piece of the company over the last  years since we launched pandora so where does that put us today pandora is a gigantic service just shy of  million listeners come to pandora every month they listen on average of  hours per month that per month number is growing yearonyear continues to grow relentlessly as we keep refining the product investing in new distribution platforms were now available on over  devices of course that began with the smartphones but were talking about connected bluray players tvs connected settop devices and wearables refrigerators now come with pandora as apparently a hot tub that has pandora embedded on so if youre in the market for a hot tub look for the pandora piece and new devices coming out every day the amazon echo great platform for us were seeing very heavy usage on that the google home device and were constantly looking for these additional distribution platforms under  car models which means pretty much every major car manufacturer coming off the line has an embedded pandora functionality its a very fast growing category for us and last but not least we are now one among a very small number of online media companies that crossed very small number of online media companies that cross the  billion annual average advertising revenue threshold and that core business is profitable for the adsupported radio products that have been pandoras main stay until today is a profitable adsupported business so i think its a really tremendous accomplishment to put some context around that we now represent just shy of  of all radio listening in united states that makes us the largest radio station in every major market in some cases a substantially larger in the local broadcast station that gives us a great opportunity to leverage local advertising dollars and i think you know fastest growing part of our revenue is that in the local ad sales domain and as we look at this pie chart on the left that big light blue three quarters of the pie broadcast radio we see that is eminently reachable were going after those hours and as we penetrate cars and the home we think that broadcast is deeply vulnerable to what we think is a far superior product personalized radio service so we see in that a huge unexplored opportunity that we are really attacking and in online streaming pandora is category king  of all streaming online is on pandora the story on mobile is no less impressive we are by far the leading mobile engagement far even with – in facebook and i think perhaps sort of most impressively at any given moment in time there are more people streaming on pandora than every other streaming service combined so this an enormous platform of having engaged listeners that we built in the last  years so whats next for us so couple of years ago we began to seeing signals from our listeners that they wanted something more from pandora so they were enjoying the regular product creating stations personalizing it in a more lean back mode engaging when they want to sort of protect the station but we saw them kind of bumping into things they want that we can offer for example were playing a song and we saw that how they use the product and their behavior on the product we also heard from them very directly we typically get between  and  emails a month from pandora listeners many of them with feature requests people are bumping into skip limits theyre losing connectivity and going offline that with the frustration for folks and we began to sort of feel something of a ground saw from listeners about additional functionality like for pandora to deliver so we sat down and really went through a pretty comprehensive strategic review process at pandora to figure out should we adopt is there a way for us to in an economically positive way to address this need and after a lot of research and really kind of studying this we came to the conclusion there was a resounding aspect there was an opportunity for us to really go after this and make pandora the one service the only music service you would ever need whether youre a lean back listeners or somebody wants it much more interactive that we could be that solution for you so you wouldnt have to go someplace else one of the things that weve seen over the years of increasing permanent security among listeners that are using more than one service and we have very compelling data about listeners on pandora that are also using other services including ondemand products so the kind of the signs however there for us and a question was can we make a great business out of it and can we address that well from a product standpoint so there are really two main pillars to attacking the strategies at the product side and there is a licensing but as key parts of delivering on that idea renew the licensing but has to really wait until the end of  which is when the copyright royalty board will set its decision on the noninteractive radio streaming rate that would form the benchmark for any kind of direct deal licensing that we would undergo following that so in waiting for that weve attacked the product we made a handful of very key acquisitions we purchased among them audio what we view is the leading from a product standpoint the leading subscription product out there crawford jack team of engineers we bought them for a very reasonable price for just less than  engineers in the pandora that team formed a nucleus of the product team at pandora that has been gone after billion subscription products that are beginning to see surface now its a tremendous team virtually every engineer has stage that we started create a lot of instant momentum and allowed us to build these products very very quickly we purchased next big sound leading music data company that weve woven now to the fabric of pandora to use across the company and we bought ticketfly a midmarket ticket saas company theyre the leader in delivering ticketing solutions for middletier clubs and that business has seen its been that explodes since becoming part of pandora we put the pieces in place from a product standpoint and then began seriously developing that product coming to end of the year we engaged directly with the labels on the right side second big pillar and as you all know recently were very pleased to announce that weve reached a direct deal agreements with every major label pretty much all of the independent and close to  publishers giving us the right to really build the product that we have imagined when chris and his team put pen to paper to figure out whats the product we want to offer there was essentially kind of a menu of features they wanted to offer and we probably get those rights and we got them all and we got them i want to note in a very very short period of time for anybody here thats been involved in music licensing you all know that six months or seven months is possibly quick to do a deal at this complexity this is not a cookie cutter deal we did want product come before us we dont think thats the right solution and it happens fast and the reason it happen quickly i think its very clear i think the music and if you sound pandora a potential ala like really a partner that can grow the industry not another substitutional product trying to take share but actually a company that could open up new revenue streams for them i think then in particular the first company that might unlock subscriptions for the mass consumer which i think has been an uncapped or unopened opportunity for many many years and yes the deals were – negotiations were tough at times they were fundamentally collaborative and i would say that if you ask anything on that side of table how they feel now i think theyd all say their echo what we say which is the truly a winwin agreement we have exited these negotiations as partners and its already showing up and how are working together as this product launch so very quick negotiation and the really two things they accomplished in this deal and theyre both very important to understand the first is we got the ability to offer additional tiers of products with greater interactivity substantially greater interactivity really new products of pandora can – in a way that not been done before but equally importantly were able to enhance the core product so we have a massive adsupported business and there are handful of features that we know listeners really wanted us to add to that product we are able to get those as well so we enhanced our core adsupported business and opened up new opportunities for the product with the plus – and full ondemand here we feel very good about this so what is it look like from a product portfolio whats the lineup at pandora there are three thesis to this with that said the adsupported product will continue on strong with two added capabilities the ability to replay and add more skips by watching a video add so this was two things i want it solved the two biggest consumer issues of pandora i believe that the most frequent complaints of pandora but things that are sending people off of pandora and elsewhere and it brings with that incremental revenue opportunity so these are high value high viewable video ads on pandora that becomes harder for our existing ad sales team to sell and as mike will walk you later on very very modest videos sell through one ad every  hours covers the much small incremental licensing fees that we have to pay for this incremental functionality so we think we brought great new expanding capability at a reasonable cost and opened up a very accretive revenue stream so thats kind of a one leg of a stool then pandora plus is a second piece again our fundamentally radiobased product and experience built around radio but now at just  a month and its unlimited skips unlimited replays and offline listening on pandora and no advertising and we think in the offline space we have again invented a very a really genius way of allowing someone to keep listening to pandora when they go offline is completely effortless it just happens on pandora the majority of the interactions are already going offline are happening with us any listener interactions just happens like magic on pandora i think a really brilliant engineering solution and were going to bring many more of those to the product again the  price points is very – i think a very strong value proposition that now was made put in the hands seamlessly to the existing subscribers of pandora launch so just one day recently their product has got a lot better at the same price pandora plus and announcing for the first time today the third leg of stool pandora premium were going to unveil that on december  at an event in new york city we hope to see a lot of you guys there half of you wont have to travel the next time pandora premium is essentially the full interactive on demand service again it will be – radio will be at its core the notion of listening continuous listening will be at the center of this product it will have all the features of plus so the rewinding skipping offline et cetera but it will now include the ability to search and play the ability to build and share playlists taking everything offline and many many more pandora features that we cant reveal now for competitive purposes but i think well bring a unique flavor to how this product services for the consumer were going to reinvent the interactive experience just the same way we invented online personalized radio so its a three legged tool for pandora and i think youll see these products are all nicely are very well related they create a great upsell path for us and for our existing user base that was built intentionally to be a ph stereo set for listeners i want to talk about that pathway today in great detail so i think we have the right product that will address the full demand curve but on top of that we think that pandora brings three distinctive massive strategic advantages to win in a gotomarket with these products and again part of the rationale for us a big part of the rationale for entering this space in the first place is we felt that we were not going to come into this through the same door that other companies are coming through not a me too product and definitely not a me too gotomarket strategy pandora has a different way to enter this market i think is very compelling the first of those advantages of course is our existing audience so we have again close to a  million listeners on pandora every three months  hours a month of listening highly highly engaged listeners we can talk to our listeners for free on our platform in the very personalized targeted way in different kinds of modes and in context of their pandora listening so a fertile ground for upselling the second is the level of data we know about listeners there is no one who has this level of precise preference information about music consumers of pandora i starts with the music side so we understand what people like at a musical logical levels starting with the music genome project but supplemented by this treasure trove of some data something up and some down that weve been accumulating over the years over  billion signals from our listeners which is very very strong preference and indication as well as station creation they help us form a very strong musical logical profile for its listener on top of that and i think equally importantly in this rule of up selling we have very strong behavioral information so we know how people listen to pandora where what are their pain points do they hit the skip limit a lot but they go offline a lot they seem to have an appetite for on demand based on how they search and use pandora one of the frustrations that we sort to see emerging implicitly from their behavior we know that for every listener again very strong signals for us to think about who we think is a candidate for up selling into these new tiers and then demographic data of course our pandora is in a largest logged end user basis on the planet but not just ridged data but a far more detail profile listeners that we do through the connection with broad data basis which again as in the foundation for our ad business so we develop its expertise at profiling understanding listeners and we bring that into this new business and then finally less but not least in the technical side in terms of technology theyre two areas that had become weve become world class i would say best in the world the first again its personalization like how to help someone how to pick that what song to play next and it meant not of intellectual property and data pandora has accumulated to make us the best at this and equally in the course of the last  years weve developed the ability to really know how and what nonmusic content to put and when in front of listeners so how to interrupt this listening experience with other content that maximizes the value of that content with minimal impact on the listener so maximizing retention maximizing special links but also maximizing the value of that insertion interruptive articles and then we built a whole infrastructure inside pandora that we call chronos which is a whole software layer call thats a great brain inside pandora that chooses those adds in a targeted way and incrementally over time that system has enabled to increase add load and increase listening so increased rpms and increased listening became more and more efficient out way to place adds that capability maps beautifully onto a world were looking to be upselling people into new capabilities so were once – we were that chronos the system was just picking between one audio add in another now its going to be tweaking between that or upsell to pandora plus or the pandora premium or an artist audio message or targeted recommendation for a local concert and as a broader portfolio of things that picks from but it brings that same fundamental discipline of being really good at picking up those in there to minimally affect our listening experience so again interrupt of the advertisings pandora expertise you put this all together with these products and there are two things that pandora can do excuse me its sets us up capture we think a substantial share of just fast growing market for on demand we are really wellpositioned to do this we bring great advantage to this space those advantages are differentiated product massive user scale this level of rich data and that drives a compelling business model for pandora were going to talk through in detail about unit economics how we control how we retain price discipline our customer acquisition cost pandora is just perfectly positioned to do this so were going to walk through the product today both what weve been building and pandora plus and some hints that was for the future and then thatll be followed by a detailed look into the business model so chris phillips our new head of products was couple of years in a fantastic new leader for us who came over from amazon he has brought a real sort of fire in the belly and weve doubled our engineering team in just under his tenure and i think were seeing the fruits of that with the rapid growth of innovation velocity at pandora so lets welcome to chris phillips video presentation christopher w phillips all right i dont know what my blood boiling more from coming on to boiling buying by logic for that new brand video what do you guys think about the new brand assets youve clearly seen them coming into building we had it everywhere and its really a testament of signal of whats changing at pandora and im really proud that our in house design team led by indiscernible who worked really hard to bring that together and bring it to life its bold its vibrant it puts the music in front and this is that key give the window directly into the music so really excited about that so i appreciate the opportunity to speak with all of you my section today im really going to focus on three things what id like first off to cover is evidence share with you what weve been building how its doing how its impacting our listeners in growth so this is all about highlighting that innovation the second thing i want to talk about is a month ago we talked to you about releasing pandora plus and tim talked about its features and new additions to our ad supported pandora im going to share with you how thats going some early look at the data that shows progress and then the third thing im going to talk about is give you a sneak peek at what how were thinking about our premium offering and as weve prepare for the unveil coming in december so before i go into that though i do want to give a shout out to our new cmo nick bartle is right over here the new chief margin officer very excited to welcome nick i am absolutely thrilled that we have a great partnership now with our cto chris martin and myself and nick in how we define build and bring all these products to market to drive huge adoption and growth so we have a great team a great executive team led by tim and everyone else so really pumped okay lets jump in i want to first start by talking about the relevance of pandora and our listener base as you know by the numbers is huge but whats important to understand is that  of our listeners our active listeners are under  years old  are under  years old so we have a vibrant audience of younger demo and while were building products that are resonated and landing with all of our listeners and we would hope to serve hundreds of millions of listeners we are really proud that the new things that im going to be sharing with you are landing working and being adopted and used and overindexing for our younger demographic and whats really exciting also is that this october october  will be our biggest largest month ever when we think about active in hours were pacing for our biggest october and thats fueled by the growth that were seeing from september and october so much so that even in our largest growth periods in  our  compared to our  and october – or  now will be bigger so thats a huge signal that things are changing and were driving growth back into the business lets give you some examples about additional data points and this one im particularly proud of when you work in product and technology the most important thing is that when you bring a new product to market a new innovation that it gets used that people care that they adopt it and  of our listeners  million people are engaging in the new products that im going to showcase here for you thats an amazing stat especially considering these new products have just been coming out over the last nine months to  months thats a big deal and not only are they trying these new products but theyre actually spending more time on pandora its driving deeper engagement and thats really valuable because we want to be stickier and sticker we collect  billion data points a day actually more than  billion data points a day on our listeners and so this engagement gives us all kinds of advantages not just to monetize and create a business but also continue the depth in what we can offer our listeners and were monetizing weve seen a  increase in our ad capacity due to this hours growth due to the growth were seeing in our listener base and thats exciting just in august yearoveryear we saw a  increase and now a lot of that was driven for our audio ads so its very exciting time not just in delivering new products but also in our ability to monetize that going forward so lets go through some examples how many of you have used thumbprint radio all right i see some hands are not up im glad to see a lot of you have clearly many people are adopting using it with  million people using this new station its an amazing personal journey through your listening i was listening to my thumbprint radio the other day and it took me from foo fighters pearl jam soundgarden and then rolled me into hippie sabatoge odesza marian hill and then back into drake  future and gez what other station does that so elegantly not just putting a list of songs in front of you for you to cherry pick but actually weaving you through a seamless experience with music you love and winding in new discoveries this station is driving incremental hours of listening has improved days active on our platform its a huge win for us and its driven by our deep knowledge of personalization and discovery about for each individual person so were really proud of this offering and over  million of these  million that have come back to pandora after they had slowed down or stopped using pandora so were recapturing audience with innovations like this thats a very important note when you think about how we pull our  million listeners into monthly and how we capture the hearts and minds of brand new listeners or people that are coming on this station also over indexes for under  listeners another example is podcast how many of you guys have heard of serial this american life been around for a while and who knew if a podcast would work on pandora we had never done it before this was a new thing for our listener base and for our platform and we said well if were going to give it a shot lets go after one of the most popular podcasts on the planet and with serial which was by the number of the most popular by downloads podcast and this american life has been around for  years and digitally i think for over  years hugely successful podcast so we worked with the team and we stood these up on pandora and weve been thrilled by the success  million and growing listeners are engaging with podcast on pandora and again a million of them had actually slowed or stopped using pandora and this brought them back in so a new content form thats helping invigorate growth more deeper growth with our existing base and bringing people back in and our fantastic advertising sales team had been working to bring new forms of sponsorship and monetization to this new content form so its very exciting and i think you should be looking for more of this as we go forward the next one ill highlight is our ongoing continued growth in automotive in the connected device space we continue to grow the investment we made in ubiquity is working and it continues to work i saw a honda ad i think literally a couple days ago featuring pandora so were so proud of what weve been able to do in the cars but we are far from done there is still so much growth to drive out of it but with  increase yearoveryear in listening hours or hours in active and  growth in ce – in connected devices we see a lot of opportunity to keep going further weve even found that some of the devices that are offered by companies that have competing services are some of our fastest growing areas of listeners and were finding that were growing new listeners on those platforms so again it goes back to the fact that pandora works it works beautifully on these products and the ease the personalization is a key factor in that so keep an eye out for more theres a whole slew of things that i could take all day talking about all the new innovation happening and we are more rapidly growing and building new offerings than ever before and some more that i want to highlight for you are around programming so the computational programming that youll see here is our scientists and our product folks worked very hard to continually refine the algorithm the personalization the insight to keep optimizing the music on pandora this touches  of our listeners so the service is constantly getting better and its driven real growth that we measure by having small hold out to compare we measure that hold out for up to a year in order to prove that we really are driving real growth we introduced a new music station and we hadnt had a dedicated place for new artists only or new music only on pandora and what we did is we have kind of a different twist on this this invention came out of our curation team where we have really skilled fantastically smart curators who actually are leading each of these stations so if you want to go to a new pop or a new hip hop or new alternative our curators are actually each week and they do a mini hosted version where theyll introduce new artists new songs you can check out and you can listen to new music only so if you want to be cool with your friend you want to be hit check these out and you can see the latest thats happening and these are personalized every other service will just give you a bucket of new music we actually know that there is that one popstar that makes you nuts and we can drop that out no one else is doing that questlove supreme very excited about what weve done with introducing this brand new program again new content program different format so questlove ahmir thompson is a – just a phenomenal musician artist thought leader in the space of music fell in love absolutely with pandora after spending time with tim and seen how we analyze the guts of every song identify that were doing this – pandoras doing this differently and wanted to partner with us and were so thrilled by this new program again we didnt know how it performed but after literally the first month we have over  million people who have added the station and the engagement that continues to grow the program is a threehour live show where he brings on stars and other musicians and they talk about music they go deep hit their spin tracks and then the program will roll over for a few days and then it goes into a mix state that questlove curates every single week of songs you havent checked it out you really need to its a great exploration through music and its just a new format for us on pandora and were really excited about that and our ability to monetize that and bring in new sponsor that want to be connected to that audience and again bringing people into pandora that otherwise might not have been on the platform live streaming we continue to bring the live concert into your ears while at home so if you werent able to make it in show that was happen in minneapolis in august i happen to be directly field watching pro jam live at that same time so you could actually listen on your phone and stream it live so we expand the audience for artist to actually get more people to their show than otherwise could be there and then with that show particular we are able to play the show for multiple days afterwards and so even though i missed it that night when it was happening i was able to check it out the next day so its very exciting whats happening there and were growing listeners and even more music experiences and more partnerships anybody used pandora in an uber ride lately all right so we have really – this new partnership is pretty exciting and we did it differently and by the way its working its has become the fifth largest auto platform for us now its a different kind of auto platform because its not your car but its listening in the car and what we did because we werent the first to market on it but we did it differently we did in a way that works in a way thats being used we started with the drivers we got the drivers engaged their connection in the car and the music playing through their driver app was going through the speakers seems like an obvious thing we focused on that first that got the attraction and then started to open it up for listeners so in the rider app if you pull up and your driver is listening to pandora youll see not just the kind of power in the face but what theyre listening to on pandora and you can continue jamming or flip it over to your station or you can just start listening to pandora on the stations you love while you are on your ride and we are very excited the rapid growth were seeing again building it and launching it in a way that gets adoption and traction and its an adsupported solution we didnt lock this up behind a pay wall ticket discovery tim mentioned earlier our acquisition of ticketfly we spent time studying our ability to sell tickets are people paying attention on pandora can i really offer them a ticket and theyll buy the answer is yes so what we are doing is we crossed our first phase of the integration with ticketfly and successfully taken their ticket inventory and actually are surfacing it to our listeners based on their listening preferences and their indiscernible songs and their location so weve introduced indiscernible into our mobile app which also has advertising benefits but we know where you are so when i dropped into new york even though i live in berkeley i can actually get notifications of whos playing that i like while im in town or coming soon so thats a really special experience and were proud that tens of millions of listeners are starting to get that discovery point and its growing so well have more to share on that later again lot of very exciting innovation happening tim mentioned intelligent interruptions and he used our coterm kronas which i am like dont say internal tech term but sure you guys can handle it and so kronas which is our code name but its way to do intelligent interruption is a pretty special piece of code its really a tool for us its a tool for us to optimize the right time to talk to a listener about all these great new things that were doing one of the main things about pandora is were not just putting ticket over into tab on the app or putting in podcast over randomly into one little room of the house so to speak while you can get to those things when you want were trying to bring everything directly to the listener so you can effortlessly discover but we have to do really smart about when is the right time to serve an ad versus when is the right time to serve a ticket or an upsell kind of day what device youre on we even know that we like some of our younger listeners when they first come into the product thats what they do they change stations they skip a bunch you think thats a good time to serve them an ad or a time to buy a ticket its a terrible time because theyre trying to peddle in their music but once they find the music they like we know at that moment at the individual personal level this is the best time to serve them an ad or a ticket or an upsell and thats an engine that were constantly working on refining and we have science behind that that helps us to do that really effectively we really think thats a unique way to reach listeners right in the sweet spot of what we do so thats a pretty special innovation that weve had life for a while now during this year and were watching great results where we did increase video capacity while not hurting listeners and thats key we want to put that listener experience and protect our listener base were also innovating around our advertizing you know clearly monetizing around ads is super super super important and mike is going to take you through later why all of these innovations driving listeners and engagement and new tools to help us drive up that rpm is so critical and so hell share more about that but were putting products behind that are working and trust me our roadmap next year has got a huge amount of emphasis and focus around adtech some of the things id like to highlight around sponsored listening we actually released the sponsored listening products last year so this is where you get prompted if youre actually willing to watch a  second video ad you can actually get an hour of uninterrupted listening brought to you by that sponsor and we have really great results with that without going to the metrics i think the one metric that i was most excited to share with you is  of the folks who are buying this new ad which is a premium ad unit are actually repeat buyers and in the digital space you have to build a measure you have to show roi you have show real engagement you have to show brand lift so thats really critical and i think it says a lot and were starting to sell this into top and different categories across pandora and thats a very exciting movement for us weve also introduced visual ad experience and this is in the process of rolling out as weve had a number of clients in beta and so weve been watching and measuring the benefits of this new product where historically on the now playing view an ad would – a display i would pop on top of the album art and if you ever get frustrated with that we have to just kind of want it get it out of the way so we think – we can do better and we have this new ad unit and takes the album art and moves it down on the page and allows the – the display ad to come over in so nothing is locking to metadata of the music your youre listening to and we remove that tax so you can swipe it away or tap it away or you can engage in the ad and were really excited about this and some of the beta clients have gone early with us using this onebyone and where we take over this whole area has seen an  increase in conversion that means not just tapping through to the ads but then linking through to actually make a purchase or may take an action and so again we want to assemble more and more of those examples of roi and return on this but were really excited about that early evidence were getting that this is a win for the listener because youre not indiscernible artist and to the advertiser because the ad is not in the way its complementary we care about the details we care about how we can make advertising look as beautiful as the music on our product and keep it simple and then targeting the targeting story for pandora weve been doing for a while but our targeting segments are at  target segments i think as of yesterday lissie and john and the team are feeding me the data and  of those target segments are proprietary to pandora we either have them from first party derived so we know that your spanish speaking with small children driving this kind of car in this area we know all kinds of things about you that we can use unleashed really smart premium premium targeting to advertisers and this is also listing what we can charge and so again mike will talk about how why we really believe we can bring this back to business results but using those risk data points to help our advertisers reach the listeners on our platform is super super important and it makes the advertising more relevant and those higher efficacy so its really valuable and heres the key thing were selling it in january  with fewer segment only  of our ad buyers were taken advantage of these premium segments now its  so again advertisers put their money where they get return and they find this is the benefit and they are using these segments more and more and we believe there is a lot of upside there all right so that was the part of the course of the agenda where i really wanted you to understand whats new what we are innovating what weve been building the evidence behind it getting traction in you so that was kind of the goal in that section now lets talk about how things are going in pandora plus and the new features weve just been turning on over the recent weeks to our adsupported listeners now before i going to the results though i wanted to go back and talk about the opportunity what is the opportunity for pandora to sell a  subscription to our user base now we think the opportunity is large thats the headline we think that well get there over time but i wanted to talk about how we came up with that ive been asked a lot how did you come up with the features of whats in plus because before it was pandora without ads how did you come up with these extra features what we didnt get we started it very carefully we use actual real behavior real data on our platform we analyze it we have crossed the consumer research we listen to what our listeners are asking for it tim mentioned that earlier you put that together as a very clear it was a very clear not even a bet as to what people would care about if we can get right and actually add these in and these new rights are going to give us all kinds of opportunities to make money with on the subscription so adsupported ad can be frustrating for listeners some listeners are okay with it but we look at ad sensitivity we measure those who at different ad levels are dropping off or slowdown their engagement and so we know there is still frustration with ads now we already have  million  subscribers and that only value prop above pandora a great pandora with without ads so we think theres still upside there with  of our monthly listeners skips people like to skip our program is fantastic but especially even in our younger demographic we see these like people who love skip or skip a lot so this is the pretty easy one for us to measure as well we look at how many people are hitting the skip limit how many people are hitting the skip limit multiple times in a month and we can understand and look at  of our monthly listeners might appreciate the ability to not be blocked and get more skips replay we didnt have replay but it was pretty clear for us in listening to our customers and our listeners looking at why people are leaving our product to go to other services to just replay that song gosh pandora can you just replay it so we looked at thumbing activity we looked at those that are actively thumbing those that are actively thumbing up and we just take a fraction of that and say what if we lit up a replay button on the songs you keep thumbing up and so that gives us a huge opportunity a  of our monthly listeners might care about that value prop and then offline this is the one i think we could be massively understating but the reality is that we have clear signals that  of our monthly listeners would appreciate the fact that pandora doesnt go dark when you lose connectivity whether youre going through the subway whether youre just over here in children park and in berkeley going to the trails and making the music helping the music continue to play is really the key and so we estimate theres a huge opportunity there again all of this does that one or multiple of these pain points if we solve them can be enough to tip you over to pay  thats the very simple math we think that adds up to  of our monthly listeners are relevant to go after and we think that could be growing all right so how are we doing so far well literally weve only had the features fully dialed up for a couple of weeks we actually were at few days ahead when we said our full dial up would happen when we met back in september and were already seeing  of our monthly active start to actively use replays and more skips and again each time they are doing that theyre engaging with a video ad to unlock a handful of replays unlocking handful of more skips so were pretty excited about that and really the marketing of that is just now starting so a lot of that was people organically finding in these great features i wanted to have a tweet board to show you all the really wonderful tweets that were getting from listeners theyre just slipping about such a simple addition thats really made the service so much better its the details under  no surprise heavily over indexing on their use of these features or under  listeners are heavily using these features so were really excited about these are amplifying the use of pandora were excited to see how this impacts retention on the platform because were not frustrating people by not offering these and very important linking this fact to our business opportunity were seeing an increase in video capacity because of these features being unlocked so thats a great opportunity where again we have this exchange were able to open up this great capability and were able to monetize that and make more money so thats a huge portion of what we are trying to do in our adsupported base that mike will talk about further how is going with plus so our  offering actually the numbers are somewhat staggering the  of our plus listeners since weve been dialed up in this window of time has usually the replays more skips or offline offline is the dominant used case that were seeing the most people using now part of that is because how we do it automatically but folks are using these new features and recall back to my earlier presentation the mass consumption of these features in the usage is what makes the product sticky that improves your churn that also keeps people on platform above and beyond just attracting people back to pandora so were excited about that again indexing heavily in our under  listeners user base thats important and were finding that already i mean were early days on this early days this is like a product persons dream that people would actually be using all these features so early  are using offline daily and tim mentioned that magical experience when you know we were talking about jim as used case where youre riding your bike from the marine headwinds and you lose connectivity for a period of time no problem leave your phone in the pocket pandora will automatically transition your offline station and then when you regain connectivity well bring you right back every other service you need to stop on the side of the road get the phone on your pocket go find your offline music probably play with the same songs that were downloaded last time you showed up and then you can get back on your bike and start riding and hopefully youre safe to that whole experience well keep going – go on the road okay thats what were doing differently but this is being used  of the engagements of offline or when we do it for you again its not just checking a box of offline its doing it in a different way and in effortless way and our engineering team have done a great job and our designers and making that come to life in such a seamless simple way how about trials i knew you guys would want some information about how this will impact the money right just to us as group you got to care about that a rhetorical question  of course you do so were pretty excited this picture right here is just showing you one of the new mechanisms that were using to convert people on platform weve talked about this very smart intelligent interactions these are prompts that come up for a replay when you take a certain action in the products like thumbing up music and we let you know that hey are you replay the song that you actually could subscribe and get replays all the time with no ads well if you hit the skip sign up we give you a prompt we call them smart conversions so based on your behavior at just the perfect time we let you know about when it makes sense to subscribe so were not going to hammer you over the head with sign up sign up we can do it in a more elegant way and what were finding plus subscriptions are more than doubled a  in conversions just in the last – less than two weeks since weve been fully dialed up compared the four when we had pandora one or  offering which was just pandora without ads so we feel really good that actually people the new offering is resonating our marketing engines are just now kicking in weve only been doing marketing really for the last week so in two weeks less than two weeks really weve seen this kind of growth one of the surprised metrics for us has been this recapture rate so listeners who had previously subscribed or tried it out before subscribe and let their subscriptions stop we measure how many of them on a monthly basis comeback and resign up were seeing a  increase in that in this short window of time that was really a surprise metric for us what that means is theyve heard oh they choose it they now have offline they now have replays im going to resubscribe so folks that had tried us stopped coming back again this is a huge story around reengagement and also the appeal of this offering is landing and were just getting started now mike and tim are going to kill me maybe not maybe not kill but theyre going to be i want to go after off the ranch a little bit here just in less than two weeks weve had  conversions which is pretty amazing video presentation all right sorry how to square that in there with the – were really excited i mean common its a great new start when you launch a product like this you put it out there even with the marketing just getting going were born or on our way to born okay lets talk about pandora premium so pandora premium as tim mentioned is going to be the unique pandora cake on demand and way more we think this is a huge opportunity for someone to start with some of the opportunity theyre going to give you a taste of how were thinking about it just so everybody can take a deep breath and i dont want to be too disappointed but im not going to show screenshots im not going to take you through features im not going to demo anything today youre going to have to come in december when we do the formal unveiling where well show you the features well walk you through the product well explain it and show it we have a lot of competitors who are joining today to participate in our show and so were trying to keep some that close to the best while we get ready for the lunch but i do want to give you some insight on why weve confidence and as we unveil in december our plan is to then start to turn it on for listeners in early q so thats kind of our plan for that all right whats the opportunity for pandora to sell a  on demand offering that is differentiated well we think we have a lot of data that gives us confidence that this is a great place for us to enter this is a great thing for us to do and entirely relevant tim mentioned that  million of our monthly listeners are spending  hours weve  million monthly listeners who spend more than  hours with us  billion songs thats a lot of data to help us know what you like what you care about your reactions your very individual personal care not with this row i will like and not with this row of folks all like but what you like and how we can actually show up in a way thats right for you weve also looked at outside research our own research and we see that  million listeners are actually who use pandora today are also using some form of free ondemand and some paid ondemand so we know thats a desire they need for some of the features that are classically available in an ondemand product makes sense were also looking at the  million of our monthly listeners who havent just dont just hang out on a couple of stations but have really deep a selected multiple stations of at least  many of them way more stations on pandora they give us all those great tastes and again thats where thumbprint really shines because we know your patterns across different music we can deliver a music discovery in a personalized way at scale like no one else and  million based on some research that weve done and weve seen other outside research that points to even a bigger number or a growing but the number we thought confident looking at and thinking about is  million of our monthly actives are paying for some form of ondemand already but still coming back and using pandora  hours to  hours a month why is that its because we nail it when it comes to discovery we know them the ease of use and many people are discovering on pandora hearing that great news songs jumping over and selecting it and doing point used cases in other services and continue to come back into pandora so we really believe these types of points of data give us confidence that in introducing a  ondemand we can win now you might ask what is that up to we think this means about  and you could argue this is growing of our active monthly listeners a  offering would be relevant and yes i know youre all very smart with math but those might be interested in plus and those that might be interested in our ondemand and overlap and thats okay so its not just one the other we think that there could can be overlap there so how do we believe we can win in ondemand and again the product well be showing you later and i think really when you first put it in your hands and that it goes your ears youre going to have special moment where you kind of get it its the ah ha but ill do my best to represent that on these – with these five points at this time it starts with what weve been saying around personalization and in effortless the other services on the market are just to conversome to use youre having to do a lot of work to go find music pull it off of a list put it into a play list if youre really intend to you build multiple lists or you to gathered on the one you come to a page in the app and its a bunch of things being promoted half of which might not be relevant for you so we really think the product we have confidence that we can just have this show and it can be right for your individual taste and you are individual person you hear a some kind of radio everybody in here has a different station experience were not just organizing you around hiphop listener you know classic rock listener who likes a little bit of old rock we are deeper than that were done at the individual level at some print and weve made it really really easy were going to take key things that we know people doing ondemand and were going to do them on your behalf think about the way were doing offline right now and in plus we can do it for you can you switch over to offline mode in plus sure you can but isnt it nice when it just does it for you so thats kind of the way we think about the product plus could be very easy to learn our opportunity is first and foremost to actually sell and promote this amongst our user base the monthly access the daily access the quarterly access that we have on pandora they know how to use our products they trust us so this product will pop up for you and be familiar youll recognize it you wont scratch your head and say how do i use this thing how do i navigate around youll walk right into a product thats familiar and knows you were going to take on this idea of the best of both worlds chris becker our lead on the product side who joined from rdo has kind of talked about this quite a bit i think its spot on every other service kind of makes you choose between on demand and features and radio you are in lean lean in mode or youre in lean back mode we just we just dont buy that there are certain things youre trying to do and we think we can blend those worlds so we let you get to what youre trying to do and if you found a specific song and then you just want to lean back and let it go well take over indiscernible  youre enjoying the radio and you start it into a collection mode you can do that too you dont have to kind of think about what mode youre in we just kind of blend those worlds and so were really excited to kind of leapfrog the leapfrog the world of on demand from a user experience perspective because the prices are very similar the access to music catalog is very similar but the way we bring the music to you the way we do it in a personal way the ease we think will be differentiated the music will never stop we are not shy about when you open up pandora music starts playing most of that its silent and after youve picked what you want to play it goes silent again that will not happen in our product we actually can keep the music going because we know you we dont have to worry about messing it up because we know what songs matter for you and we can mix your favorites and with discovery all the time and then the final point that we mentioned earlier but i really do think its important is one of the key reasons to believe that we have all these intelligent ways to smartly reach our listener base based on their usage patterns their behaviors we have our science team are working on probably six models around willingness to subscribe willingness to trial when is the right time of the day all the details whats the base what kind of music theyre listening to when you might convert these are super smart ways for us to help reach our huge audience and our growing audience in a way that no one else can and these are the things that give us confidence that our on demand  premium offering is going to be really great i would ask you one thing as i close out here if you havent yet checked out your thumbprint radio station you need to if youre confused around other things that are out there the people say deliver discovery check out thumbprint radio and check our plus and use your thumbprint while offline that is a sick experience thats amazing its great thank you very much unidentified company representative ladies and gentlemen well be taking a short break for refreshment well reconvene in about  minutes for the rest of the program video presentation music video presentation please welcome to the stage pandoras present president  chief financial officer mike herring music michael s herring all right thank you inaudible right and thank you all for coming here and joining us this afternoon i know its busy earnings week and not a common day to choose for an analyst day but its a critical moment in the evolution the transformation of pandoras hopefully youve seen through tim and dps comments weve been working for years to get this point me personally for threeandahalf years  years for tim but we think weve aligned a lot of things up to this moment to take the next step into pandoras future but before we get into that im going to spend some time walking through our quarterly results and then we released them earlier today you had time to digest them september  really marked the beginning of this transition its cost structures are changing related to the direct yield framework but more importantly our priorities are shifting from being a primarily advertising supported service to one that has multiple products and revenue streams and that transition really started in september and affected our earnings in q and its affecting our outlook for q i want to talk through the details there and so we all understand we start from kind of the same footing and then well go through specially how we expect the business to evolve next year and over the next few years towards  in terms of our target metrics for that over the next four years and then we look forward to answer your questions to you at the end of the day so lets start with revenue total revenue for the quarter is  million it was  million below the lowend of our guidance range and that was really driven and it was in an advertising driven by national advertising softness that continued from second quarter primarily in the entertainment and telco verticals but in general in the digital demand space there was overall softness in digital advertising we expect that to continue we dont see any big changes of that in the q and thats reflected in our guidance for q but advertising revenue still increased  yearoveryear at about  million in q versus  in q of  local advertising at  of revenue in q continues to be a steady engine of revenue for pandora turning to subscription subscription revenue was actually at  million a slight decrease yearoveryear of  i think this is a kind of underlying a lot of the transformations were taking here pandora one has leveled off at approximately  million subscribers it added  subscribers in the third quarter increased about  but its been in the  million to  million subscriber zone now for well over a year at about  of our active and with a single value proposition which is a sort of advertising no advertising value proposition reason to subscribe and consumers move back and forth in and out of that from our ad supported business and so a lot of the things that chris talked about tonight it really efforts to drive higher conversion higher penetration rates and well talk about that a lot more in the next section ticketing revenue in the third quarter was  million and that business continues to operate at or above expectations it had great growth transaction value in the quarter growing  yearoveryear  million for the tickets sold through the platform that generated – that  million tickets about  million ticket buyers thats a growth about  yearoveryear covering across  live events through the ticketfly network so not just great business in itself but as dp talked about really an opportunity to connect live events to the demand that pandora can bring but the advertising market as we can see here is seasonal and can fluctuate dramatically based on exogenous factors anything from changing in market plans shifting demand product launches by ourselves product launches by other players in the market larger macroeconomic issues like the economy or elections all can affect how much – how advertising can be built in a quarter and how that trends over time that will continue to be an important business for us for a long time but i think this quarter results really further support the plans that weve been putting in place for some time and that were now executing on the building scale or subscription offerings and diversify and extend the revenue stream turning to active users and listeners active users were essentially flat yearoveryear and sequentially seasonally q tends to be down a little bit because of the summer months but – and we see that in listener hours down from  billion to  billion hours in the quarter that  billion is also restricted somewhat by pandora as we signed deals and prepared to launch plus we started restricted hours on the ad supported business in august through september so cost control a little bit also starting to create more opportunities for upsell – crosssell opportunities as we look to launch subscription businesses ill provide more detail about our expectations on that business here in a second we continue to grow rpms while controlling lmps this has been a constant vein that we reiterated now for really three plus years its critical to our ability to expand our overall gross margins and ad rmp continues to increase it increased  yearoveryear  sequentially as we get – we continue to be more efficient in selling advertising on per hour basis despite hours continuing to grow significantly weve added the arpu as a metric here largely because going forward that can be a really important measure of our progress im going to finish todays conversation talking about the specific metrics were going use internally but also share externally but q arpu is approximately   something were really proud from an advertising perspective its a multiple of any other advertising supported service out there its really the cornerstone of what differentiates pandoras model now in going forward total rpm is  increase increased from  from third quarter last year and the lpms at  thats up  yearoveryear thats largely driven by the crb ruling last december up a  from q in part because september was now under the direct deal framework fit slight increase in lpm and cost going into september and well talk a lot about how thats going to manifest itself in the model going forward i will want to make a note here that going forward we are not going to talk about lpms in the context of the subscription businesses any longer the new direct deal framework does not have an activity based cost to it or royalty calculation so we will no longer need to worry about limiting hours into the subscription businesses its much more based on an arpu its an arpu based royalty calculation not specifically that there is a lot of complexity around it but generally speaking arpu versus lpu or licensing cost per thousand hours is going to be kind of a new metric were going to talk about thatll show you how youre going to expand margins over time and track our progress in that and ill talk about that at the end of the meeting as well kind of diving down a little bit further down income statement in terms of our q  results gross margin yearoveryear declined  but was up  sequentially by – as we managed hours controlled pot and grew rpms in that timeframe our total employees at the end of quarter was  up from  last year this time product development and ga in  both took step up function beginning of this year as i am sure you remember as we invested to build a infrastructure and product capabilities to bring ph subscription products to markets that you saw in the last few weeks with boston and coming in premium but as we move through the year those possibly leveled out and we made the big investments in order to get these products to market in a timely manner we said the rates was between our ability to license and our ability to build product i won the race by the way a month ahead of chris but to the extent that we made those investments early so were delivering products that we can pay licensing accurately on and that work when you start using them so huge kudos to our teams who brought the – who were able to bring these things and be able to launch them earlier in the year than we really expected to external marketing sales and marketing decreased  sequentially its largely that drop is a decrease in marketing spend from q – from q to q we spent about  million in external marketing in the third quarter really as products kicks in and started driving users and hours engagement it reduced marketing spends q we spent a lot more we spent  million that quarter reducing marketing in q and sort of gearing up internally in order to bring plus to market and then later on to bring premium google and apple commissions in the quarter were  million which is represented about  of the subscription revenue those of you who follow this line closely will know that thats down from  of subscription revenue in the first half of this year that decline its the beginning of the changing in the commission structure with apple and google that were going to see kind of gradually come into play through the end of the year as there is their commission structures from  to down to  thats something weve been working with apple and google as partners for a long time we are not interested in going around and trying to find alternative ways to charge customers who wanted to be easy simple to use and we have found the platforms both with google and apple being credibly great for subscription conversion were already seeing that as a kick in now as you saw stephi talk about in the new plus offering and so its better to focus on the right commission structure with our partners and over time i think we feel less and less billing for through those platforms as we develop our own direct payment relationship with our customers and upselling cross sells can be done through those direct payment relationships great example of that is the millions of dollars in tickets we sell every quarter directtoconsumers all through credit cards through a web interface as we merge sort of the user ids between the two platforms i think we have a really healthy conversion upsell on pack rate there at a lower cost to consider over time lastly just from a sales perspective we finished the quarter with  quarter bearing sales reps but a  still of which are our local sales reps we are very directly on kind of ensuring that getting that advertising business ready to grow again over time when we talk about what we think is going to drive that growth but that we – its a  billion plus ad revenue business its very healthy at its core we had a great team we build great technology around it we think thats going to continue to be an important part of our strategy so at the bottom it comes down to our ebitda loss of  million in the quarter slightly the lower guidance range youre factoring the fact that we had about  million in additional content cost in the quarter from signing the deals which was not anticipated in our guidance for the year and ill talk about that at the end we would have been within the range even with lower revenue as we managed costs both from a hours perspective and the pace of operating expenses normally i dont spend a lot of time on cash flow and earnings but this is kind of an unusual quarter from the cash flow perspective and that ive already been getting a lot of questions as we announced the deal around cash flow and cash requirements for the business when we started the quarter with  million in cash on the balance sheet we made  million worth of upfront payment related to the direct deals that we signed the net increase to royalty prepayments on the balance sheet is  million the difference reflects the amortization of some of those upfront payments activity in the quarter so lets put that in context and when we file our q well disclose the total amount of prepayment but and there are over several years about  million worth of payments that will be made sort of over that timeframe as guarantees against royalties it is a fraction of what we will actually pay its a fraction of what we pay today these are not or we hope to reach certain milestones to make these payments these are just prepayments against future royalty obligation that we plan to and could even if the business stayed flat well exceed so its more of timing from a cash flow perspective and youll see theres  million in the quarter we drew down in our credit facility thats intended to mirror that upfront payments and we established that  million credit facility last year at the end of  for this specific purpose we wanted to be able to operate the business with confidence and aggressively be able to manage the timing of payments because we knew historically thats way the music industry like to do business they like to get paid up front and we – and if you take those off of the table your rates go up right so to negotiate we want to be able to keep those on the table negotiate the right terms and that – and being able to write checks for a  million and balance that with the right appropriate balance sheet financing as there – with an approach we decided to take the rest of the cash flow fluctuations in the quarter are within normal operating parameters and we finished the quarter with  million in cash talking about our guidance for a second before we get into the business model our previous revenue guidance for q was  million its at the midpoint i mentioned the softness that led to qs results we expect that to continue into q and thats about an  million hit were also taking about  million worth of inventory that we normally use programmatic channels to sell and were going to use that internally to drive subscription as long as that make sense thats the plan initially well do – its a tradeoff between those two things based upon earlier conversion numbers some of which ph dp mentioned thats certainly going to be a plan we may even accelerate that the midpoint of our revenue guidance then for q  is  million ebitda our cost structure was changing a lot i mentioned regard the deals are done sooner than we expected right after labor day that changed our cost structure from a content cost perspective it also changed the timing of bringing these product to launch specifically the first product specifically reflects features we wanted to make sure we did that with confident gave it the right boost out the door and prepped ourselves well for the unveiling in december our premium in the launch of that product in early  so of all those things created and ins and outs here that affects what our ebitda is going to be for q previously our guidance was an ebitda profit of  million the  million from the revenue adjustment comes off the top because we saw the same infrastructure were not slowing investment in our advertising business  million in our royalty cost stepup this is essentially were going to talk about it here but increased slightly in lpm related to the advertising business and an increase in the royalty calculation for the subscription business that already exist the impact of that as a stepup function is about  million in q and from then on it will grow at those new rates or decline depending on a lot of factors well talk about that too as we move through the year its not a linear thing its sort of an adjustment to a new level of royalty structure and then  million in opex that we are committed to spend this quarter to make sure that we launch these new subscription products with the right effort behind them i would now like to turn to our growing order business model and the changes that are pretty profound as tim put it from the direct – moving into a direct licensing world and its dramatically expanding on revenue and product portfolio revenue on indiscernible product portfolio so this quarter – its really the transformation in pandoras business the direct deals its not with the music labels complete an evolution thats been happening for a while and you have been watching it and asking me questions and asking tim questions constantly about why do you do this why do you that its all to get to this point i say a lot internally pandora has finally got to the starting line of the next  years its started  years ago with the strategy that we put together as a management team it started to show its head last fall when we signed broad publishing deal with the entire industry that enabled these products to come to market it included settlement of the  losses that were floating through the course of last year still are today could – would have still delayed everything and the end of the crb process the two things that kept us from talking to the labels in a meaningful way tim mentioned that we did this quickly in six months we built relationships over in the last few years the last six months we have the big obstacles and the lawyers we are letting us talk and we are able to sit down and talk about how we build the a business together that both of us benefit significantly over time that was a big big step forward these new revenue streams are really important so weve got – as you heard from cp they are building on the base of strength theyre building on the competitive advantages and assets that are unique to pandora and give us a window of time to build a big interesting profitable business and thats what gets us all excited here is the starting line were ready to run for the next four years weve set big targets for ourselves out there and those assets the big data assets that chris talked about the valuable advertising platform that takes our funnel for driving users and make it a profitable engine its not a cost center it drives significant dollars into the business its a  million quarterly users right now using the product that are right for being exposed to these new product offerings and the pandora brand weve seen this new brand the new energy behind it were really excited about it internally but broader the brand recognition and a positive affinity for it its really important when youre introducing subscription businesses the trust of paying a brand that you know is going to deliver a product you care about that matters a lot and pandora has a huge stepup there ive ran multiple subscription businesses in my life this is my fourth time around build launching and building subscription business and that is critical its as critical as managing churn its critical as optimizing your customer acquisition channels its building trust with your customers and then brand is critical to that and the last really important thing i want to point it that pandora customized personalized radio product its the killer app it would drive engagement its the way americans like to consume music and for those of you who are student of subscription business and the student of advertising engagement is the magic word for driving effectiveness in advertising and conversion and retention in subscription and we already do that better than any other mobile app out there by a long shot so huge assets that may give us confidence to move forward and our  targets reflect our ability leverage those assets to address this large and growing market opportunity and the way its going to move im going to put some numbers and third party numbers out there to kind of quantify that for you but if you walk away from one thing with one thing keep in mind we have overnight dramatically increased our addressable market opportunity i mean yes there were lots of steps that got us here but through the launch of these products and the signing of these direct deals weve opened up our addressable market significantly and were doing it in unique way with a balanced operating model were not focused on how do we describe as many people to this subscription product as possible and have to comprise our way to get there we have an advertising through the consumer ad supported business thats profitable we have subscription up sells with a real value proposition and a huge audience to apply it to were going to talk about the arpu curve but the whole point is we have available audience today and everything were doing is going to increase the value of that audience over time on a per user basis and on an aggregate user basis so clear path to achieving  target unique opportunity available to pandora comprehensive product suite satisfy anyway people want to consume music and at the end im going to just talk about metrics milestones that were going to use to drive our business and you can use to hold us accountable i mentioned the direct deals i do want to lay a little groundwork here on the context of the royalty structure that were going to be operating and because i think there is still some confusion about why we did these deals and what they actually mean for us and there is a lot about –  of the discussion its been about the increasing costs and that is real under the statutory licenses we paid a  ltm in the adsupported business thats going to  into the direct deals but thats not just giving money to the labels for the pleasure of doing business under the statutory license we have a very restrictive rule set about how and what music we can play and in what manner we can provide internet activity to users that is increased dramatically and we think that that can turn directly into revenue from an advertising perspective and from a conversion and subscription perspective on the subscription side there is very – there is no additional functionality available under statutory so on the radio subscription side the indiscernible products we had  with just adfree as i mentioned and there was no ondemand interactivity available on the statutory rate im moving to world of direct deals significant value propositions to move people to that mid tier products and multiple features in functionality will be introducing in order to take that into that next level to the  so yes its an increasing cost but it totally changes the opportunity you have just to monetize the business so im going to talk to the unit economics of each of these levels of consumer engagement and talk about the marketed opportunity for each one of those and then ill finish with the metrics as i mentioned well start with unit economics so we now – weve gone from having two sort of price points to three lots of iterations within there but were going to keep it really simple today and im not going to talk about ticketfly and im not going to talk about international those things are important strategic efforts for pandora for a variety of reasons but today and for the next  months were really going to be focused on bringing these products to market in the united states what the opportunity is here and driving this business domestically and so this entire presentation for me is going to be focused on the economics around the us business and our opportunity in the us business that  billion that we talked about is our target for  for example as a us domestic target okay this best the way were thinking about it target arpu were at  now for ad supported thats sort of  to  – sorry  to  rpms we get that to  to  and we get to a arpu of that  we think thats more than possible were  to  rpm today at existing ad loads in our top  markets in the  to  demographic lots of opportunity to grow ad load lots of opportunity to expand our advertising business today its  billion already we think that has a lot of room to grow pandora plus is   arpu business on a per user basis pandora premium is  the  so we have a stepup each time in terms of revenue per user but what really matters to pandora when we think about this is not revenue per user if you think about the old traditional software models they used to say well you just sell youre shipping cds you sell as many cd unit its all about revenue optimization curve and thats how you determine how to market drive customer acquisition then everyone switched to saas which i was a big part of back in the mid and all of a sudden had to convince everybody it wasnt revenue optimization anymore it was gross margin optimization and that same economics works here extremely well we are about optimizing contribution margin so a little bit different than gross margin does include like servers and colocation stuff all which are commodities now and are collapsing from a cost perspective to companies the scale of pandora what really matters is our largest cost line which is royalty cost and weve structured our deals that did two things one incentivize pandora to pay our label partners and our publishing partners more so we are aligned to move up the arpu curve they make a higher percentage over time or as you move up that curve from a royalty perspective and we make a higher – our contribution margin per user increase pretty significantly so when we go from an ad supported user and we convert that person into a plus subscriber the optimized – this is the optimized model here well talk about  models in a second we go from a  contribution margin for user to  contribution from user  increase okay we go – get back same user to premium thats a x contribution in margin per user converting from ad supported to there and about  – what is that due math  increase over from plus to premium so the point is that we have every incentive to move individual users of this plan one of the questions i get lot is are we cannibalizing ad supported great business balancing by offering the subscription services and ill talk about lifetime in little bit but right here is a great example of why i would say its not about cannibalizing its about optimizing the value of each user in a way that optimizes our overall customer base from a company perspective and we get to do this because we have all three because we are generating  at the top and  at the mid year and  at the bottom and we can – if were never going to convert selling from adsupported we dont have to make the life miserable we are still going to make  per year off that person if all i have is this bottom premiums subscription my only product is a  per month product all im going to do is due to over the head try and punish you down that problem and there is a limitation to what happens and by the way your short changing your longterm opportunity that way because someone might not describe now but next year they might they might be a yearold today but in four years they might be ready to upgrade it to midyear product but there might be  today and do midyear and employers to be upgrading to  is there music preferences changes is the way they music changes we keep everybody in the ecosystem this way all other product changes the way we structured the product ladder everything is about keeping people in the pandora ecosystem where they want to be so we optimized retention and optimized longterm – life time value of that customer we moved them up the value chain we had a – im feeling operating profit and operating margin in here because thats really important contribution margins are important here ad supported is the higher operating profit on the percentage basis that drops just from the nature of contribution margin dropping as a margin as you move from plus to premium its critical to being able to achieve this in a mix basis therefore – our  target in  is that you have price discipline on the left price discipline around that  and  arpu and your abilities to drive a successful ad arpu if you are unable to do that and those start to collapse profits get a lot harder this is about having a discipline around your business model diversity around your business model and youre able to treat customers the way they want to be treated and be patient as they move up to that line now now wed certainly want to drive as many subscribers as we can as fast as we can dont take that in the wrong way indiscernible we want to do that as much as possible but the reality is we cant be patient because we have a balanced business model describing a little bit to ad supported  arpu today growing to  arpu in optimized targets this is done largely by increasing ad load increasing the highvalue inventory from an advertising perspective this is i think immensely achievable i want to remind everybody we havent increased maximum ad load in two years that means that we are  to  in the top  markets have been maxed out from a monetization perspective for the last yearandahalf two years its not that we couldnt sell more ads there its one of the reasons why weve slowed local investments down its because local investments largely sell to radio buyers radio because of the nature of broadcast where its one to many its focus intently on  to  so we sell out that segment very aggressively we could sell more but wed have to increase ad load and we purposefully didnt do that for those markets over the last yearandahalf as weve been saying to you often in order to preserve that user base for the opportunity thats in front of us now weve got to the starting line as these products become fully available increasing ad load becomes as an important part of the answer there i talked about this cost structure going from  under the crb to   in ad supported rpm in q so a pretty healthy margin but not  well how do we get to the optimized target well its by growing rpms and a lot of it is what i talked about here already but that  operating margin is it rpms of  to  and that sounds like a pretty big number i mean going from  to  its not insignificant but let me remind you that threeandahalf years ago when i walked in started pandora in february   that was  so weve come a long way in that timeframe and without the benefit the of unlimited ad loads we havent chased every dollar were now giving ourselves a chance to go fuel up more of that and we think that getting that up – another  to  is eminently achievable over the next few years the incremental lpm from  to  its not insignificant when you apply it its a billions of dollars thats why there is  million part of the reason why there is  million more step up in cost just in q right so but its not for nothing the potential revenue opportunities and conversion opportunities they come from that additional features and functionalities that were paying for with that increase in lpm its not insignificant now just in the video inventory if we sell one more video ad for every  hours of listening we will cover that entire end piece in lpm just with that one piece of increased inventory you heard tv sales about  increase in video inventory just from the addition of these new features in the first couple of weeks like this is a – video is the current hot thing right now that its rollout of demand is there is programmatically theyre buying it we dont have to move the needle much in order to cover that because we have we kept add load so much lower another way to think of it is these features and functionality engage users they stay longer they use – they listen to the service more if hours increase  at the same rpms we cover that  lpm some combination of these are more that cost is easily covered we do better than that now we start having an accretive benefit to the business from having these additional features and functionality in taking on  more of lpm so we really are excited about that opportunity just covering a little bit on plus the value proposition weve talked a lot a bit about is very dramatically better now than the former pandora one piece its really important you have a reason to convert ad free is that  of the population now in limited skips and limited replays and most importantly offline real significant reasons to convert you heard cp talk about sheered incredible numbers of the people who have a reason – have a reason to recognize the value preposition of converting but we did – we are taking the gross margin the contribution margin of this business down relatively significantly its about  in the old pandora one structure into the crb it will start out at about  growing to  as we scale this business so there is a – thats also part of the  million content costs increase its an increasing structure in order to grow this business pretty significantly and there is a breakeven point it depends on where we are between that  and  but to put it into context we get to – we reinvigorate our consumer base lots of reasons to convert much higher reasons to retain pandora one if you cancel your subscription you have the same product you just had to listen just some ads not a lot of ads many people would say now if you cancel your pandora plus you dont have offline anymore your skips and repays are limited significant reasons to stay – retain and that was that weve seen some already some big reductions in churn just in two weeks i mean these are little tiny things but if anybody who knows subscription business you tweak churn like  basis points and its where tens of millions of dollars of the scale were talking about here so we think well more than makeup in volume here and invigorating our customer base for the decline in contribution margin pandora premium as a  arpu we have lots of personalized features of functionality we think this is going to establish this is the true next generation of what ondemand functionality can feel like in a personalized world and were incentivized to keep moving people up this – up this curve and get to this plan i talked a lot about contribution margin lets talk about lifetime value for a little bit so this is a really simplistic view starting with direct margin taking  to  churn thats how we do vastly better than that but we for an argument sake didnt want to argue about what – whether this is the good churn or bad churn those are pretty aggressive churn numbers lifetime value increases significantly and this matters from a subscription business lifetime value determines how aggressively you can market what customer acquisition costs you can accept in order to drive the business you know keep in mind our lifetime values – our customer acquisition costs today in the business is a single digit so we have a lot of room to grow if we decide to get once we figure out this math once we figure out the conversion activity and opportunity if you ask any subscription marketer if youve got a  customer acquisition cost and a  lifetime value of the customer you have a long way to grow that math is really important and if that lifetime value shrinks because churn go up or pricing declines or your direct margins declines and all the kind of things that people worry about that limits your ability to grow the business limits the size of business you can be profitably great news is we have a long way to go lets talk about the market opportunity for a second i want to start by putting up the target we put in front of all over the last february we had accomplished a lot in february we had bought rdio we had done all of the activities in  that i mentioned earlier we still have the direct deals with the labels in front of us and – but we had a good story we had a good pitch and weve felt like we needed in order to justify to ourselves to our board and to our investors the investment in the direction we were taking we needed to state what we thought we could do if we were able to get these deals done and get these products to market because we just spent  million on rdio for technology that didnt have an application to drive revenue in  and were committed call that specifically  million in opex investment in  again for products we didnt have licenses to deliver weve now done that and we can say that the deal structure that we have and ill walk through how we get to these numbers a little bit enables us to bring the products to market that we think will drive the revenue streams get into the market opportunities that deliver on these numbers that put in front of you in february we think well be able to grow our total monthly active users to north of a  million talking about  million here  billion in revenue in our core radio products thats between plus and ad supported together combined we consider that radio cleaning and subscription revenue at  billion right the reason we call that separately is premium subscription is ondemand and one thing we agree with the music industry very vehemently on is ondemand functionality should be behind a  a month scale anything thats through ad supported or thats a midyear were focused thats our core radio business its a great business at  a month well have full functionality we think thats going to be great business at  billion  million in ticketfly revenue gets to the  billion record thats our target for  contribution margins that are now enabled through these deals allow us to get to a target consolidated operating margin in  at  those are the same numbers that give you february this still stands here today and now important to all this happening are some things that were going to do internally and some things that we expect to happen in the broader market one of those things is that this market is large and its growing we think its going to continue growing the adsupported streaming radio market  million users today inaudible causes  dominant market share we think that continuous to grow thats a great tailwind in our back its a  million users by  the paid radio subscription market is a little awkward because were essentially it external indiscernible third party resources is five million growing to seven million i put it in dash  plus million because we actually think that plus has a much bigger market opportunity than external today and well talk about why we think that in second and then today  million us subscribers to on demand products that was recently updated increased after only a year by  to  million i think the point there is twofold one thats  million thats a  billion plus market by  in revenue and those estimates just keep getting revised out as consumers habits they learned the pay for music again they learn to value music and said subscribe and that the activities theyre doing in live events going more than ever that starts to translate into how they listen to music too and were going to be part of that revolution zeroing in a little bit on the core radio opportunity thats  million of that  million about  penetration that we think will convert into paying radio listeners so that midtier product our target is about  million subscribers of the plus product  million of the  billion in revenue advertising we expect to get to about  billion by  thats had an  rpm across the business by that point given now its  today we have a work cut off for us but we think we have a clear path to do that arpu will hit  by  so its not quite that  is optimized but well get there contribution margin is  operating margin in the ad business at   for plus getting to  as a combined and all these slides will be available to you later so you dont have to write down too seriously really important is our territorial area becomes less relevant digital radio especially personalized radio is going to grow like crazy  million today is a big number we think that grows to  million this is external third party sources we think it grows faster than that when you breakdown this business its going from  million listeners now to  million new listeners in  years  billion in revenue to  billion in revenue so this is serious growth its a reacceleration of advertising revenue growth we purposefully have held back some of our abilities to drive revenue over the last year or so and ive talked about that we think we can reaccelerate that for reasons weve shown you today and then the deals that weve structured to preserve our ability to drive significant contribution margin on this business the kind of waterfall getting to that  million a big piece of that is just the market growth but we also think we still are going to have the best product out there the best features and functionality optimized for listener enjoyment so we absolutely believe that well continue to maintain and grow that  market share according the trend rpm mostly driven by ad load increases so increasing the ad concentration across our entire base but also pricing this pricing is really drilling into a mix shift to local as we expand atmos and we can invigorate the local investments as well as the addition of high valueadd inventory like the video ads that the new flex features the features that weve introduced in the last few weeks are going to enable also the exact sponsor to disney can you remind a year ago sponsor to disney was just getting launched this year that will do well into the tens of millions in revenue at a very high rpm as we do more and more native advertising like that it has a really nice effects in increasing pricing over time going from  to  we think is eminently achievable talk a little bit about the overall economics around plus again  million to  million from thirdparty sources we think thats well in the north of  million potential our own target being  million so obviously we think that the markets bigger than what thirdparty sources would say today thats an  million penetration in the  million users and about a  contribution margin so a healthy contribution margin not quite optimized yet were growing into that the way that deals that the music industry work but increasing steadily overtime to get to that point where does the user growth were starting at  million a part of that is just pure market growth part of that increasing market share within that market but the biggest piece is penetration and what drives penetration is value proposition to the user i had already talked about todays its just ad no ad weve added three significant pieces of that just by adding that penetration on top of a big user base we believe its going to drive well in excess of – well in excess of the subs we have today and will be the biggest part of driving  million subscribers now keep in mind we know this is net of the number of plus new subscribers we think are going to migrate quickly to premium there is always some percentage of subscribers who buy a most expensive thing and believe me we will aggressively make sure that every plus new subscriber knows premium exists and theres an easy path to getting to testing premium and understanding the value proposition and moving to the next level from  to  but all our product testing all our price testing tell us that there is a huge market at the midtier thats completely untapped right now and its important from the long term health of the business how that means here to teach people to pay for music again the value to begin and to move up that value chain its one of the big selling points with the music industry its why they embraced our midtier product were about yes this will help pandora itll help overall the view of music from a consumer perspective content costs will also improve contractually with scale so we improve our economics through scale purely through the leverage in the overall business from operating perspective but also with contractually with our music partner as we move through time youre going to see our contribution margin at each level of product improve with scale as part of a lining or interest with theirs and its our way of saying to the music industry were on the same team its about growing the overall market and as we grow the market were both going to share in the revenue and benefits that come from that some of them are soft data promotion et cetera that we talked about a lot through and some of them are real much harder what are the royalties we are going to pay and what are the profits pandora is going to be able to make one question i get a lot is how did you make the decision to put all spend  million settling law suits to spend  million buying rdio we spend a  million in opex last year we did a thorough examination of all of the potential of these markets that weve talked about and then we said to ourselves is the investment in a hassle and the pain is worth doing it and the answer was an unequivocal yes from a management team from our board and a big part of that is understanding what is the return on all that investment right so when we took that we allocated some of that to plus and we allocated some of that to premium to understand what return were getting on this investment now were starting with  million subscribers here so from a return perspective we breakeven at about  million subscribers right because of the contribution margin declined et cetera but the return on the investment to bring this next generation midtier product to market is breakeven at  million it exceeds our cost to capital which nobody in this room cares about that but i still – i like to do the math occasionally it takes me back to college when we used to make decisions based on cost to capital but we – at  million subscribers we cross over our cost to capital has calculated but what really got us excited is we did this all this work and said wow we think we still have a  million subscribers business in  and thats a  roi and the investment is going to take to bring that product to market lets do the same analysis with premium  million users today growing to  million if everyone have the price discipline pandora tends to have an apple as google has thats a  billion revenue business on markets – market size in  we think we can do  penetration of a  million users that for  million subscribers  contribution margin by  were starting from zero and well start from zero at the beginning of the next year launching this product in the early  market growth has been – is going to be a huge wind at our back but its all about penetration its about proving the value proposition to our user base and converting them we think were going to be – we have a great value proposition and we have outstanding plans to convert them in the right way smart conversions as cp talked about in product already and giving them a great product experience and showing them the obvious reasons why conversion makes sense and through scale we achieve healthy contribution margin so  content cost  operating – sorry contribution margins by  back to roi again so the majority of the investment to get here we allocated the premium we think its bigger revenue stream over time its a  reliant on us doing these deals and building this technology we break even on that investment at about  million subscribers or so across the magic cost of capital line at a little over  million subscribers its a steep roi curves in there at a  million subscribers which is not a phone number all right thats  market share from zero in four years but a  million subscribers thats at the  roi and thats our target thats the way we look at it when we think about why make all these investments why go through the trouble because its a great value building investment that its going to provide a high return to our company and to our shareholders so just quickly review kind of the way it looks consolidated our  billion revenue target here is a  million subscribers in plus its  million subscribers in premium  billion revenue in advertising  million in ticketing gets us to  billion so thats kind of our standard thats where we can we think about the business the reason i have this scenarios not really to say i think something is more likely the reality is we have a balanced operating model its not one dimensional if conversion to premium its higher or lower it doesnt completely determine my fate its one piece of the puzzle we have multiple things to operate against its the value of a diversified product portfolio so as we look at kind of potential scenarios out there our target numbers are in some pretty wide ranges i mean a  million range in premium revenue now keep in mind that cost associated with that revenue is a  variable so contribution margins are  whether theyre  billion or  billion so there is ample opportunity to drive profitability in cash flow at any level at any point in that line the point is that i think there is a lot of opportunity were going to learn a lot over time we think weve set aggressive but achievable goals and that there are upside to that if we execute as well as we think its possible the way i think the market could bear lastly i just want to talk about the operating margin here when we these arent the optimized levels but when we get to  that  is made up of kind of  from core radio  from premium  from ticketing to get that  operating target as revenue moves around in those things that might change a little bit i think we have a lot of levers in order to hit that  but this is where were starting this is our base of operations lastly i want to spend a few minutes talking about key metrics and then well go to qa so metrics to the ad supported business havent changed so hopefully youre well indoctrinated how we talk to the business this way how many users driving how many hours whats the rpm associated with that multiply that by hours and you get our revenue from our ad supported business well report on those and well talk about that therere a lot of derivatives metrics that we talk about our quarterly basis sales people not recording by sales et cetera we continue to do that but if you understand where lpm is the relationship with rpm and lpm and how that directly drives growth profit margins – contribution margins then you understand that business from a plus and premium perceptive its a new game its really all about arpu and lpu which is kind of a new metric well be talking about its about licensing costs per thousand users and the spread between those two so how well are we able to maintain arpu price discipline relative to the cost on a per user basis which is that lpu number and that spread we believe not only from our own operating leverage but from contractual leverage built into the deals we have with the music industry will increase over time with scale so youve got to watch for the number of subscribers scale arpu price discipline and lpu how that changes over time relative to arpu if you follow those costs youll understand how were doing from a progress perspective and we will disclose all of those for both plus and premium on a quarterly basis cp gave a lot more stats out than he normally would today we will actually continue to give a lot more when we go – especially the first recorders when this is all new about trail starts and conversion rates and changes the return were going to be a lot more transparent about how things are going at least through  and so stay tuned for februarys earnings call on exactly how were going to do that we think about milestones the key milestones are all about rpm on advertising business how do we get that to  is that our pure margin in that business and subscribers how do we – how is conversion going to drive  million plus subscribers how is conversion going to drive  million premium subscribers by  those are critical for driving operating margins we need to drive subscriber numbers and if we maintain arpu we have the contractual ability to drive real margin average to the bottomline and thats why operating margins at the end of day our goal – all these goals lead down to are we driving a profitable business over the longterm and delivering value to shareholders so just to close and then well do qa these are large and growing markets and the deals we signed last month have really opened up brand new revenue opportunities huge markets addressable markets for pandora that were previously inaccessible these deals provided predictable cost structure with attractive unit economics that improve with scale improve with time and they enabled the product suite that really reaches all desires the way our listeners want to consume music and those give us a balanced operating model and a clear path to achieving our  targets and with that im going to ask tim and cp to come up and well take any questions you may have thank you very much for your time questionandanswer session a  unidentified company representative thank you before we turn things – i hope one thing i take away from what youve heard today is this plan has been very methodical for pandora we have chosen the time to intersect the market a lot of what weve built todate is may not the sexy stuff radio part doesnt have the bells and whistles of a lot of products that consumers have out there but weve done the hard work which is really understanding and building a easy to use personalized service and monetizing heck out of it and no one comes close to that and actually indiscernible the probably opportunity indiscernible you understand today massive profitable addressable user base thats prepared to go after this and there are a lot of time where we can engage with the industry constructively two years three years four years ago this conversation was labeled but has not gone away did now and weve earned i think our place earned these deals that we have put in front of them to set us up for this opportunity going forward so were proud of about it were eager to get to race forward but hope that comes through today from my presentation so looking forward to questions mark mahaney one longterm question and one shorterterm question in terms of promoting or getting go into market with pandora premium could you – i think mike you talked about some efforts could you maybe qualify that a little bit more whatever how youre going to get the word out how youre going to differentiate this product in the marketplace outside of the product i mean i guess im more talking about the marketing side of it and then just the nearterm stuff the weakness in the ad revenue again and it looks like its going to continue in the december quarter whats the confidence that doesnt continue and bleed into next year like how do you it seems like this keeps coming up or may comes up everyone in a while a little bit more on how you sustain that base or would you just have to go different advertising verticals in order to really grow that business unidentified company representative great so ill answer the second part and then briefly we want to talk about gotomarket strategy for premium specifically so advertising business is one that has a lot of exogenous characteristics to where we talk to i mentioned a bunch of it and kind of listed a bunch earlier its one of the attractiveness as a subscription business as you can smooth out a lot of that over time and so having that balance in our operating model is really attractive from that – from a predictability perspective et cetera that said being able to monetize the three user base the indiscernible is a significant competitive advantage and being able to continue to do that and to continuing to do that in an increasingly profitable manner is a major priority for pandora now that takes investment it takes the investment in sales infrastructure hiring sales people and take investment and technology in order to make sure youre accessing demand where it goes the shift to programmatic two years ago on the mobile display side was an example of that which we have caught up with the reality is were – that always going to be a challenge and that theres admin close in that but we think that focus we cannot take our eye out of that ball because its such an important competitive advantage to us what it will become is less critical to our overall results and certainly even at a  revenue split which is almost you gets – its a little bit higher than that i think in our target you get to a  advertising in  advertising revenues but still very material but the value of a subscription revenue stream the annuity characteristics of that i think are going to really change the way we view kind of the business over time so its an important leg that the stores as tim said so clearly early on and one well continue to invest in but it will increasingly become less noise in kind of the overall company results unidentified company representative just to underline that too ph mark i think were just seeing a little bit of growing pains around how to address the advertising market for us so we ph fish in multiple times as a company right and performance and digital and local and national spots upfront and – so you have to aim your ph cannon at various times and you cant always turn the cannon quickly and so we sometimes also to be slightly out of step with our own demand this year hours on pandora were so much more than we had anticipated and we had planned that here in terms of how invested both in the ad sales team and in technology were a different reality we learned a lot from this year on that and we are in upfront season as we speak and were taking those earnings right now into how to address  so nonetheless makes this concern in the larger level so lets get efficient more quickly at how we staff and invest on technology and tech and advertising is a big focus for kristen and the team going into next year unidentified company representative yeah absolutely and on the marketing side for premium were very excited about the fact that nick has joined us and will be out of share more about – more details around how were going to go to market and reach all the large base that we think we can install to but at a higher level its important to understand that we have a lot of listeners on this platform today so theyre visiting our product quarterly at  million monthly  million we talked about the signals were getting so we can do really precise almost surgical marketing to reach listeners and tell them about these new offerings and whether its plus its premium were going to have some very attractive trials which were going to will well talk about later that we think are going to be very appealing to help move listeners up that curve as well so great opportunity to sale to listeners who are already using pandora and trust pandora were also going to bring people back one of the things that im hoping you took away from earlier was that weve been attracting listeners back to the platform with new content new capability new devices and we think that helps reinvigorate our listener base and we have another opportunity to kind of sell to those folks by just talking about how great pandora is evolving a new and then we have these opportunities to subscribe and the great news to you is that those who try and subscribe even those who decide may be not can fall right into one of the other tiers are ad supported and can be a loyal listener and we see really good data on those listeners as well so its really building that listener base selling from those who already visiting us bringing them back with new content and marketing those things as a key value prop unidentified analyst hi james indiscernible partners as a followup to the previous question can you just go over some metric in terms of how many local ad sales people we have from august  to august  and what do you think over the next year and whats the productivity trends with the local sales people unidentified company representative yeah so i think – i finish this quarter with a  i think it might be exactly the same year ago i dont remember pretty close i think we started this year with the  leasing at least then we added a few q last year its been essentially flat largely can say those local sellers are concentrated in the  large markets that we largely sold out in most of the inventory they sold historically so we shifted some of the way we impacted in sales going into this year because we took a  million that we could have invested potentially in driving ad sales and into launching plus and bringing premium to market early next year so that was a conscious decision its – we think we have delayed our ability to penetrate that market by year but we dont think that we lost any competitive ground from that perspective its too early for me to say what were going to do next year from that perspective what i will say is in those markets where have been essentially sold out in the primary market we are going to be more aggressive about ad loading those as we bring subscription products to market which will open up capacity to sale more in the local markets which is a broadcast buyer we also look at new forms of demand as inventory for example on video becomes much more prevalent on pandora with all the video demand thats happened over the last few years weve had very little piece of that because we just dont have – were an audio platform and the video does the view ability of the video is hard to justify pandora and has been historically thats changed a lot over the last few years with sponsored listening and with the skits and replay functionality where you have to be engaged with that and weve really grown our access to that market significantly i think youll see shifts maybe not as much in total numbers of sales people add were just focused is on driving demand for advertising revenue unidentified analyst some of the mature markets you have how many are hitting  arpu right now or whats the max at right now michael s herring all  of our top markets in the  to  markets are north of  from an rpm perspective daniel salmon hi guys dan salmon from bmo i have two questions maybe one kind of nittygritty one for mike and then a bigger picture one maybe for tim the nittygritty like you talked about the app store platforms being a great user experience for getting new customers being much happier with the commission structure there and how its evolving but also the longterm opportunity of your own platform could you maybe just add a little bit of a color on how you envision taking users from one of those to your own platforms just add a little bit on i think we all know how the economies would change but just a user experience and picture that a little bit more is the ticketfly billing platform build out in your data base of users growth and then for – just everything here today is largely focused on the us opportunity and the new product then we didnt want to get into international whole a lot today but as you look out at those  targets whats your updated thinking on how international thinks into – fits into that is there a little bit into it is it a lot incremental to that just maybe where your head is on that today thanks michael s herring so just quickly on the subscription dynamics if you go back to the first half of the year when i said  essentially of a   of the subscription revenue was paid in commission with avalon well pretty much tells you about twothirds of subscriptions are in that purchases now thats a  million subscribers were about getting to  million subscribers by  obviously some portion of them will be that  million some portion of them will convert through apple and google but theres a whole green deal that how do we develop payment relationships with our listeners over that timeframe and whats the best way for that listener to pay for their subscription thats the way we want to focus how we can – whether were paying  to the mastercard and visa or paying a smaller percent in paypal or theres a  million to other payment structures out there were paying  to apple and google the critical piece about driving subscription has been less focused on that and more focused on driving subscribers has been be less focused on that and more focused on driving subscribers and working with those partners over time on interviews look at apple and google over the last couple of years theyve changed the way they allow payments structures within their app theyve lowered the percentages they take as they think about their own app environment and their place in the ecosystem over time their own priorities are actually much more closely aligned to pandora than you might think and were seeing that manifest itself from the lower commissions structure its also in the way they allow companies like pandora who do it right by the way thats a really important thing we follow the rules we work closely with them to interact with our own users especially users that have been part of our ecosystem for years so thats a long answer to say its unsure exactly other than most of the subscribers havent – arent paying us now that we think are going to drive and lots of opportunity to make sure were doing it the right way for them in order to convert it to the highest level in the most optimal way to drive profits for pandora tim you want to answer international timothy westergren yeah so on your international question when we launched pandora for about  months back in  we werent blocking listening internationally you could log into pandora just pretend youre a us resident by typing a fake us zip code and use pandora and for  months our most popular zip code was  on pandora by a wide margin obviously it didnt reflect the population in the city of beverly hills there was massive demand for pandora outside of us it was growing completely word of mouth with of course zero marketing and at that time when we had english language only catalogue so we were not really international service so we know the appetite is out there as a company we are all of course eager to get back to the global experience that said we are focused on crushing it here in the us australia and new zealand is doing great we have a great team down there its growing well its  of the market and these deals are set up so that when were ready when labels are ready as addenda you add territories add countries but i think we look at it if we really do own the market here we are set up to grow as we desire outside the us so we cant take a step at a time but i think really focusing right now getting these products out all three of them getting really got our feet planted here and then take the next step at the appropriate time christopher phillips i just want to add you mentioned addendum and thats how you grow this business if you remember itunes with the us service and then they are added countries from there over  years in order to expand into international territories its the natural way of licensing work in the music industry the key is that in the us we have built the infrastructure to manage the metadata the royalty calculations et cetera just for the us thats directly extensible so applying it to international royalty structure as well so weve done all the hard work made back to like to an roi international markets have different challenges but that core challenge and the ability to actually deliver the product from an infrastructure perspective at least its solved largely through the deals weve already got nat schindler great hi nat schindler bank of america merrill lynch mike first thank you for so much more detail on your longterm plan but wanted to just ask one question on the ad supported and one question on the premium on the ad supported can you help us out with the inconsistency here looking at your target which requires even  million active users and nearly doubling of arpu when active users have been going flat to down fairly down basically flat and arpu is in singledigit growth how do you jump start that and then on the premium side when you look at that target of  million not yours but in the us onesixth to oneseventh of the us population how does that compare indiscernible to the music industry like to talk about  of spend prior to on per on average – prior to – on an annual basis prior to the introduction of mps how does that compare though on a median basis so if i could borrow lingo from our friend indiscernible here on how many – where would that fall that  million fall in that range unidentified company representative ill let cp talk about the user number in a second from an rpm perspective i try to describe why were confident in increasing that a big reason is that we think that the advertising opportunity is huge and were just still in the early days of penetrating that opportunity considering the size of our audience and frankly especially on broadcast the weakness in competition we have purposefully in order to maintain that user base and not aggressively grown that as much as we could we grew it to a point in the mid s but where we had enough contribution margin coming off of that part of crb and through this year to fund the business essentially that was the first priority over the last three and half years whereas drive monetization so that we could grow the business using internally generated profits from the ad business as we worked on new products to bring to market and i think weve done that extremely well ad load being relatively static over the last few years is probably the biggest factor there pricing is also a factor as we reinvest back and grow local markets which are enabled by ad mode we introduced ad much more video inventory which is x the cpms of audio inventory so there is a lots of ways we think we can do it but i think the way were most comfortable is that we feel like if we had decided instead of going what we did stay out supported and statutory rates we would have invested a lot more in growing the ad business and growing ad rpms we think theres a lot of room to do that still out there from a user grow perspective you want to talk about that unidentified company representative yeah excuse me so i mean first and foremost its start with  million listeners that are engaging with us quarterly and that really gives us the rich opportunities to bring the amount and start engaging that more on a monthly basis so we already have a big chunk of that in front of us that we have to convert and i think one of the things and then of course it was new listeners who went to bring on there is still a large audience that are listening to a broadcast radio or we also know that the just rise of a lot of the competition is creating awareness so when we talk about the fact that were flat in the last quarter and ive mentioned earlier that our october is actually up and were starting to see the growth engines kick in thats not because weve just kept the same users we actually do have some sense of erosion that happens and thats through any service and what weve been finding is that we have our loyal listeners but weve been bringing people back in and that – its bending that curve and capturing more of those folks to come back in and use the offering more often and thats why we were – i was really wanted to make our point around how were seeing people come back because of the new futures they are coming back with a new content programming and really just is like drumbeat a of new thing is coming on we think is really key to drive in that growth and our listener activity from the  million and from people who wont use in pandora like some of the new and its like  to  of the usage on these new ce devices our brand new accounts so its still – its a small of it but its growing and were city people reengage and at the end of the day we know that weve been somewhat operating with hands tied behind our back because we didnt have licensing to offer certain features that now were able to unlock in as reported with replacing sched with our  subsription offering and then with premium that have been causing people to start using other services and so the idea is that having the right offering makes us much more attractive to keep people on platform reduce the churn off attract people back keep them sticky and thats basically the formula for us bending that curve up bringing those people in and growing even beyond that and i think thats where pump that we are seeing the positive trajectory of those things are working and now we just have to kind of keep showing you the results of those capabilities unidentified company representative and just quickly on the last one did you want to add to that so i mean the math youre talking about is like  of people spend the equivalent of a cd on music prior – until napster and other things sort of destroyed the cd business there is lots of sort of lore around what happened to music and we least kind of restore those dollars our view is that that market – the music market of tomorrow it looks nothing like the music market of  before any of that happened and thats why i think why i just struggled with that number right theyve increased their target for   last year to  million im glad at the reasonably large number because i can use that mind as a justification for why theyre investing these dollars and do we think we can drive that kind of penetration but the reality is theyre using that same math to try and figure these things out and its changing dramatically internally we try and get it on a lot of different things we try and get it on consumers willingness to pay for cable services turning into ondemand video to consumers willing to pay for serious  million people –  million people paying for that now look at the way its changed consumers the way they pay for software now in subscription business we changed our whole – we as a consumer base changed our perspective as to what we pay for how we measure value over time that has not got to music yet it started to the music subscriptions are starting to get there but its still behind in part because there are too many free options that dont monetize while theres too many and there has historically been a lot of piracy in the market and we taught a whole generation that they dont need to pay for music as that changes i think youll see that market have a totally different shape than the market of  and cds were still king it wont be – cds arent coming back but there is a whole new dynamic coming that we believe and we think that the music labels and the publishers and the pandora have all gotten the same title lets say that not only cannot be big but a lot more valuable we started thinking about value of annuity stream versus ups and downs of cd releases so lots of different ways to think about it i would drop closer analogies to the evolution in the way videos have changed over time and the way we pay for that and even services like serious it was proven once people engage and find value and something and develop habit theyre much more willing to pay for subscription over a long period of time unidentified company representative id also add to that right now on demand services are basically  million songs in the search box for  a month good luck and on the surface that sounds like a wow the keys for the records for  a month but in fact thats such as a debilitating consumer experience and so a big part of this is solving the easy use problem and making it intuitive then that i think is part of attracts the mass consume to the product as well and just to understand what chris said earlier right now it looks like the growth from this september to october right now the last time we grew this fast was five years ago  when we were in hyper growth so year after we went public and our product was growing like a weed now with couple of weeks in like beware of making drawing trajectories so early but that should at least be indicative of what happens when you start to add features to the product that really do meet the consumer need and we certainly feel like we picked the right ones barton crokett hi its barton crockett from fbr i wanted to get your views on the rest of the price composition subscription with amazon coming out with the cheap offer the discount for prime subscribers competing obviously with the amazon and apple is going to need to make money in this business could be a loss leader for other objectives that they might have so is there something in the licenses that you think should alleviate our concern about potential price competition in this service unidentified company representative so i can start and you can add to it ill just talk about price composition generally having price discipline is important at this price level all our testing shows that what matters more is features and functionality and differentiation and so within this sort of  to  range its less important that your  is cheaper  is cheaper its much more important that youre delivering on the right product promise and value proposition so if we deliver on that we think were in a price point that works for us i would point out that a lot of that kind of gives a lot of noise if we see how much conversion that happens into smaller population were talking about the entire us population not amazon users or specific group that they are trying to upsell who are already paying a certain amount maybe they will pay an additional amount for amazon music i dont know the answer to that question what i do know is that we do very well on their devices that is in all our price setting shows that kind of price differentiation isnt what matters at the end of the day the reality though is that most – other than a handful of players most products out there are maintaining that  price and when you talk about apple and such and then its important and i think over the long term youre going to see music industry really focused on maintaining that price discipline as an industry because they led that squib over the long term theyll move in the right leverage in order to maintain the revenue streams theyre giving even if in the short term there there being propped up unidentified company representative thats what i was going to add to that certainly in the context of our conversations theyre sensitive to two things one is price compression that makes a consumer think its cheaper and thats not good for the industry and the second thing is they dont want to wind up being the equivalent of the cd collection in the back of the warmer where you are lastly get someone to walk through refrigerators and toasters to get to the shrinking ph sound of music they know that right they look – right now their current partners for whom music is not the focus and thats going to indiscernible not one of them they fear the day that one of these folks hand them a term sheet they cant refuse because of a big distributor its been built into their product they get that i think woken up to that and i think they see in pandora the perfect sort of ally that wont go down that path so we have an ally i think in them when price disciplined and the amazon echo thing thats a tiny audience now right its a good price point but its addressing a very small audience barton crokett okay right and if i can just ask one other separate question on the numbers you threw out the  million of prepaid is coming at you could you put a little bit of more flesh on the bones of how much cash burn this is going to gender over the next couple of years as youre ramping up and similarly you talked about the  million of extra spend in the fourth quarter this is a launch youre spending  million on this going into it is the cost base now next year like  million or is that a onetime spend unidentified company representative well talk about its not a new level of spend and well talk a lot more about that when you we get to february on the  million in sort of those are more commitments over multiple years so thats not a check i guess to write anytime soon the checks we have to write soon or the  million weve already wrote that i talked about in cash flow so and we amortized that pretty quickly it will – our total funding cost this year becoming like  million so those kind of prepayments those commitments are well within the envelope of what were going to pay over the next few years barton crokett these prepayments hit like once a year basically or unidentified company representative it depends they all dependent came out each deals different i mean thats one of the – each deal is different and the terms are confidential so im trying to give you a picture and the queue will drop in for the obligations at a little more detail on it but the reality is that theyre all over the place in terms of how those payments were structured and how they are recoupable but they are well within the arm of our expected royalty obligation barton crokett okay thanks unidentified company representative thanks kunal madhukar question on revenue and the – on the advertising side you talked about the rpm going up significantly from current levels and you talked about video as well as local as well as sponsored radio being the key drivers of value how are you thinking in terms of how much video contribution would be to that increase in rpm versus sponsored listing versus local unidentified company representative i think ad load will be the dominant piece of that so over the last year or so the biggest driver of rpm growth has really been pricing as we kept ad load pretty tight over that timeframe and we just increased pricing through things like sponsored listening increases pricing so when we think about rpm its really price times quantity divided by hours so in order to increase rpm we need price or quantity to increase to drive revenue and hours stay at the same as hours go up as it has its the headwind in the rpm one of the reasons rpm has grown lower is that our denominator that hours has grown very quickly this year but when you think about pricing and quantity quantity is the ad load increases something that weve kept relatively tame over the last two years and we focused on price i think thats going to shift a little bit so were asking whats going to have that larger effect its the things that were going to do around ad load which is increasing opportunities to insert video ads through valueadded – value propositions through listener as well as just increasing overall ad load through technology improvements like kronos which increases ad load through intelligent insertions you heard a lot about that today as well as just overall increasing envelope of total potential ads someone might see in and indiscernible  kunal madhukar thank you unidentified company representative sure mike graham hey its mike graham from canaccord thanks for all the info today i wanted to ask you about the interplay between the ad business and the subscription businesses it seems like in the early days most of the new subscribers will be up sales and then later on you might have to market for like fresh listeners in to pandora im wondering if thats the way youre looking at and in those early days have you made an assumption about the ad supported listeners that come over are they high rpm low rpm are you just assuming average and then as a quick follow on to that in the slide you put up about the amount of contribution process that drops to operating profits it look like it was lower for the subscription products and im wondering if the difference there is marketing spend like you expect longerterm that you are going to have to spend a lot to get those subscribers unidentified company representative yeah so start with the last one there is some assumptions around subscription conditions that effect that number which is one its harder to drive leverage on to know we will like we make some assumptions but theyre relatively conservative as to what the mix is between an app versus to the question earlier so we take some very conservative views on that we think there is upside there as we work closely with apple and google to improve that in terms of which listeners migrate ill tell you there is a twoprong approach one is incredibly detailed approach that says well with this population it moves and probably then we convert three times higher here than we do here because there is a propensity to pay for a box or you just take a blanket number over time the difference is actually relatively small because the number of views are so big if you had  million users and you are converting  million itd be a much bigger deal when you have  million users and you are converting  million but impact to overall add rpm even if all  million come out of the  million to  million there are your highest rpm users the impact over the ad business is meaningful but its not enough for you to worry about oh i shouldnt target those people aggressively historically that was different recent target or used to a month ago target users who listened a lot we would not try and upsell them because the activities the subscription relatively made was based on a per stream basis so these stream  hours or more we lost money on you as a subscriber the old netflix problem where they lost money on their best subscriber this was  years ago for netflix right different world and a streaming world well different world and pandora post labor day world where now its no longer based on that streaming so those high volume listeners we can convert if those high volume listeners happen to be at a very valuable segment from an advertising perspective you might say well were going to beat them there and increase advertising there and make more money off of them there is a direct correlation with churn and retention associated with that and if you can decrease churn and the propensity for that person is stay with pandora for a longer period of time if you convert them even if you come at a lower – it would have to be a pretty big swing even if you come over it at a lower contribution margin you just decrease churn like  basis points the lifetime value is still higher on a subscription business and you have to think about optimizing the portfolio product based upon lifetime value thats why go to the trouble of calculating those numbers and its from – its vibrant that we spend the time to just try and talk about that concept here because were not throwing products out there and hoping people convert doing it blindly were priced we have a gotomarket strategy we have built a royalty structure that optimizes as we move up that chain in every – and mainly there is a five people in new york that dont qualify for what i just told you but when you think about when you put in churn and retention customer delight into the equation then you have a balanced portfolio where you can optimize where users will retain the longest thats always the better choice for the business and thats our approach and i think that thats going to prove out to be the right one over the long term unidentified company representative and just to put a final point on that engagement and churn are inversely related right and the great challenge that all subscription services are facing now is churn their hunger for – they would kill for the engagement we have on pandora to get engagement they do stuff like saying how do they stay listening heres this and heres that and heres that come back come on spend more time because they know if they can get you using it just like a health club eventually youre going to sign off we go into this business the kings of engagement so as mike said yes highly engaged is a valuable asset for a user but that engagement will translate to a lower churn on subs thats a good business so i think we have solved the hardest problem not to repeat ourselves i think it embarrasses repeating we have spent  years building a product thats addictive we know how to play music for people how to engage and how to keep them thats the hardest part now we go in and take that into these new products in a way no one else can do and it gives us i think a level of flexibility and go to market that just no one else has so im glad you asked that question the cornerstone question for us unidentified company representative yeah and one additional piece on that i suspect you guys both agree with all of that is on how were marketing and talking so its not just pure farming of those monthly listeners and moving them over as we talked about we have a number of listeners who use us less often and maybe move from the monthly active to a quarterly active and some of thats being driven because theyre speaking other platforms to solve these ondemand needs we see a lot of people and back to the competitive question earlier using multiple services so we really not had the capability that we know is directly pointing to why people might have slowed down some of their use they still come back we still keep engaging them so a lot of it is bringing them back in selling them so while we are talking to our existing base and we have the opportunity to sell them were also bringing people back in and were tracking new and we have this really great relationship with them which is why so many people came back and use thumbprint radio like oh man i love pandora its so perfect and they fall in love again and thats the kind of story we can have whether they go back in and use adsupported more but they come back in fresh and they take plus or premium so it is hunting and farming is part of the game plan unidentified analyst hi its a indiscernible partners just two followup questions number one i know its early days for the skip and replay adsupported products are there any data points that you have and number two varying now between – between now and  do you anticipate that well have to have another capital raise unidentified company representative ill take maybe the first question so earlier in the presentation we talked about we are seeing some really great interaction with replays and skips even though our marketing engines are just now kicking in to tell our listeners about these feature both on platform and off platform earlier we talked about  of our actives even this is the first few weeks are already starting to use skips and replays and is driving  increase in video ad capacity from that use so that is a great single on something brand new because youve got to get new – youve got to get your listeners using your new things and the whole idea is that we feel pretty good that were doing a great job getting people to our new things but we can do way more there is a tons of headroom unidentified analyst question inaudible unidentified company representative yeah exactly so thats video ads load unidentified company representative in video ad because you have to engage with the video ad in order to unlock that handful of replay and unlock that handful of skips and then using those triggers and upsell where you get hey we felt that you love replay you might love our  offering so as that starts to kind of more awareness people start to oh my gosh i can replay a song they started to replay all the time it gives us multiple touch points over time to start to talking about subscribing and if they dont subscribe thats okay were making more money with those video ads and were keeping them from leaving our app and going to youtube i mean thats why adding value to each of the tiers in our lineup is so important and just to your second question before we indiscernible spend a little time on the cash flow statement or the cash flows for the quarter we have committed to new obligations in these deals but they are well within the envelope of our operating model as we see its going to occur so right now we dont see any current need to raise additional capital peter c stabler thanks very much peter stabler wells fargo one on engagement for chris and then one on advertising for mike on the engagement side chris i think your slide showed that for the ad supported model you didnt assume that engagement was going to increase much over the next couple of years from  hours so just wondering do you think the improvements youve made to the ad supported products could increase engagement and then how are you currently thinking about the car opportunity which i think a lot of us have looked at over the years and thought about the  of radio thats happening in the car when do you access that in a more meaningful fashion and then i got one for mike on ad spend unidentified company representative so i mean we do think that engagement hours are going to grow i mean mike showed us one of the options that can really help us achieve a lot more amortization opportunities as the hours growth and really thats one of the things were most excited about and what were seeing in  is were bringing people back in and theyre spending more time they are engaging more so we do believe that hours will go up and thats a good thing our average hours per listener is increasing so dave did you wanted to add unidentified company representative yeah i just wanted to add unidentified company representative you answer and ill go to the audio question unidentified company representative okay so there is also a modeling aspect of this which is we definitely assume that people – the higher their engagement as an ads per user their propensity subscribe is higher theyre going to hit more conversion points theyre going to use things like skips and replays more frequently and when we build that into our conversion model that – those people will have  hours or  hours a month or have a much higher propensity subscriber as so many indiscernible as you can so even though it might look like oh ad product is not growing its really because its a shift of the conversion the subscribers that are converting are the higher use and if you look at the average hours per user from a subscriber perspective its around  and – by the way all these slides are going to be available to be downloaded in pdf afterwards so all these numbers would be available to torching with over the next few years peter c stabler great thats helpful unidentified company representative and on auto do you want to me to talk about auto peter c stabler yeah thats correct unidentified company representative so i think we – were really excited about auto and ce as i mentioned earlier and actually coming soon im not going to kind of promise any specific date but i can tell you there will be a drumbeat of a new connected cars coming on with gm and honda and so forth so theyre kind of rolling out different models and different time periods but literally over the upcoming months and quarters youll see more connected cars come on line with pandora lid up and we see really great engagement when you could actually leave your phone at home and your car has pandora rolling so that is – we think that the repeat use the engagement can get deeper with the emergence with to the connected car but we also are seeing more and more engagement with people using their phone and continue to kind of tether into their speakers using their phone so were going to invest on multiple fronts in how capture more of the listening in the car we actually think that even our move into the podcast theme and spoken where we see a lot of people engagement in that kind of content during drive times so think of it as its like making it really easy to access think about it as having the right content and creating awareness around that we see there was a lot of upside and a lot of that is kind of just engines theyre going to kind of keep cranking out results that ultimately map out and grow peter c stabler right then mike on the advertising side and you said  in revenue this quarter on a local side local accounts were about  unidentified company representative  sorry peter c stabler im sorry  unidentified company representative yeah if ive said  i apologies  peter c stabler my mistake  so when we think about the market about  of our audio advertising is local whether its spot local or national local just wondering if youre looking at the market any differently now than you were a couple of years ago where do you think that  could go over the next couple of years and as your enthusiasm from the local audio ad market then develops thanks unidentified company representative yeah despite the fact that we are a number of local sellers hasnt grown in the year or nearly a year our enthusiasm has never been more so frankly for the local opportunity it does take more work we do think there is a self serve opportunity longterm local so we think its definitely a north of  of broadcast revenue certainly it is going to come from that channel at the end the enthusiasm in the field i was just recently took our detroit team out there who is neck and neck with dallas in terms of our top performing regional offices right now in terms of  performance and they are as bullish as they ever have been so you ever want to feel good about yourself as a pandora employee go meet with our sales people in the field but that makes me think that like there is a lot of room to grow there we need to enable that through technology through ad load there is a lot of pieces that still have to happen to make that work well the block heavy blocking and tackling getting to this point i heard an amazing effort by our sales team to get to where we are today to continue the momentum theyve had the enthusiasms there and we think that will continue to grow i definitely think it will be more than  over time unidentified company representative and definitely – one of my own focus as a ceo is definitely nailing that local we look back in hindsight at this year – how it planned for this year projected our inventory and how youve hired didnt accordingly in local i can answer you do that differently ive been probably on a  sales calls over my lifetime at pandora ive been to the local indiscernible as discounter in dallas with a local seller and if you just look kind of squint at our business where is the math of opportunity is there and you talked as somebody has been at pandora for a year that come over from clear channel of cumulus or what not if that got really want us take and that well take it theyre going to their same customers but they have been selling broadcast radio and theyre putting firmness portfolio of ad products that have targeting and reporting all these is itself evident if that is a massive competitive advantage so now i have been pushing the tech team like were going to invest in power that capability at pandora we should be crushing that opportunity to sort of over inducting as a company and how we drive revenue locally so were learning things every year and we have to kind of enjoy to get that right but well see it i think really being laser focused on accessing that opportunities in that doug anmuth thanks doug anmuth from jp morgan mike just a couple of questions on the cost side on the ad supportive business whats the right way to think about lpms going forward is that stable or is that increased with cpi over time and then secondly i think you showed the content costs for pandora plus coming down over time in the longer term model how does that work and other certain hurdle rates you need to hit for that perhaps unidentified company representative so to get questions on so youll see that our lpms get to a higher level than  by  in the model thats assuming a cpi increase somewhere to whats built into the crb over the same timeframe so thats exactly what is in our assumptive model for  and then for both plus and premium the royalty structures change over time depending on scale and there does – a very important aspect of our fields with the music industry in order to align both our incentives to grow in certain ways and also to help fund our ability to grow those businesses by making the return on making those investments higher so if i get better returns for hitting a certain levels of subscribers over time because i – my content cost go down and were willing to invest in that now right you can calculate a lifetime value of a customer at a certain contribution margin you compare that to a customer acquisition cost thats the mechanism which justifies that marketing spend where that conversion allocation from advertising to subscription and a lot of things cp said here thats a big part of what we spent the last two years was getting the music industry to understand and buy into that strategy where if you want big subscription businesses to thrive out there and pay you  billion a year which were forecasting paying the music industry by the time we get to  so thats where we go in and we say were not here to ask for price rates were saying lets put a structure in place that rewards us for driving a business thats going to pay – go from paying  million a year this year to  billion a year on an annuity basis only four years from now and by the way that can only happen if we are making money on the bottomline perspective and have the right incentives to drive the right growth and thats why those things are built in that way i cant give you specific milestones and exactly what drives that because the terms are confidential but the philosophy behind the way we structured these deals and built the relationships with the labels and the publishers was based upon that central tenant doug anmuth okay and then just a quick followup on – recognize this is a multiyear process and i kind of think about  as the first normalized year unidentified company representative lets hope so doug anmuth hope so but within that context can you help us think about nearterm profitability or loss so you saw the ranges in  theyre almost as big for  in this context of subscription numbers and premium adoption et cetera so we will give some idea around that in the february call but it will be definitely range based we will have – well be  days into plus really on our earnings call from q and so well have probably a lot more information and talk of – whats that unidentified company representative premium unidentified company representative no  days of plus unidentified company representative right unidentified company representative premium would be – its going to launch early  so well have just launched premium well have  days of plus experience we can be a little more definitive about expectations for subscription growth shifting from our user growth generally weve seen some good initial things over the next first  days but its a data point not a trend at this point but we like the data point so its hard for me to say now and its going to be hard for me to say that its impossible for me to say that maybe the best way of putting it weve built the structure to optimize this business over the long term how we get there in the trajectory to which we achieve these milestones that drive the target margins that we expect those are going to be selfevident through acquisition and thats why we laid out the metrics that were going to share so you can measure our progress and evaluate our performance and hold this accountable and the milestones that we think we need to reach  rpm things like that certain milestones in terms of subscriber numbers in order to achieve that level of profitability and that level of revenue growth well know more in february well know a little bit more as each quarter kind of unfolds well try and be transparent as possible but its too hard for me to say right now and will do the best we can over time unidentified company representative okay thanks unidentified company representative thanks doug operator great indiscernible do you have any final questions in the room but we have one from the web from jason helfstein of oppenheimer jason helfstein do you believe that the swedishbased company that is currently negotiating – renegotiating this deal is that the music industry is trying to shut down the free service the premium or simply get compensated at the level of the ad supported for that usage unidentified company representative i think what youre going to start seeing is discipline from the industry around requiring all sort of parts music services to be value accretive to the business so in our case we have an ad supported foundation that were upselling from we make money on from which we generate large royalties companies will not be able to get away with over time on monetized funnels that are essentially not only loss creators they are also the ones that train consumers that music is not – has no value perhaps in even more damaging effect of those things and everything we are hearing from the industry is they really want to be disciplined about that so i think were going to see more and more deals as it going to affect every company in doing this some already have this discipline are very sort of cut and drive out of thats just going to get more and more i think constrained unidentified analyst its ph tony gruff from stifel i just had one question on the cost structure reconciling a few things in a deck mike you mentioned that subscriptions wont be incorporating usagebased charges anymore but there is a slide in the deck which is pandora plus deals are now based on percentage of revenue per sub minimum or a per track rate so i just want to reconcile is it just a premium that does not user space unidentified company representative yeah its – so i cant seek specifically to the term but the royalty rates associated with that are based on calculations that are based on the arpu of the consumer and so do not fluctuate with usage stacks so that in terms of modeling thats a way i think about it in terms of performance the way to think about it unidentified analyst yes thanks unidentified company representative sorry i cant answer to you directly unidentified company representative all right thank you all for joining us we invite you to head downstairs and enjoy some refreshments and some music we have unidentified company representative maybe before we adjourn thank you all again for spending so much time with us today we have some alcohol downstairs to ease the pain really i appreciate your comment here were going to hang out to take any additional questions i hope you sense kind of our excitement and confidence of whats ahead we dont – we feel like as might – we done a kind of foundational work really really hard stuff and we feel to adopt to expand the business so thanks a lot copyright policy all transcripts

online radio thats cool addictive free andjust maybea lasting business by stephanie clifford stephcliff  comments radio on pandora founder tim westergren seeks headphone blissâ€”and a business model that works credit michael edwards michael edwards iâ€™m with the band most of pandoraâ€™s analysts are professional musicians they all work part time michael edwards close listeners pandora analysts rate songs on the basis of  different qualities at a rate of no more than six songs per hour tim westergren is due to take the stage in an hour yet he seems half asleep his shoulders are rolled forward his hair floppy and unbrushed and hes wearing loose blue jeans and scuffed hiking boots he ambles around the auditorium hes rented at the san francisco museum of modern art while the staff of pandora the online radio company he founded buzzes around him the salespeople smile at the advertisers the bizdev folks pump the arms of partners the engineers form a nervous little knot meanwhile the crowd gathering outside the auditorium doors keeps getting larger pandora has been around in one form or another since  and has spent most of its existence on the brink of shutting down yet westergren has always found a way to rescue his company and infuse it with new hope new direction tonight is one more of those times pandoras biggest product launch since its debut the company is announcing a move into mobile products which will let listeners access their personalized radio stations over sprint nyses phones or sonos and slim devices inhome music players finally at  the doors open and westergren  snaps to life most companies have customers pandora has fans nearly  of them stream in to hear what westergren has to say there are guys in shortsleeve buttondowns a redhaired middleaged woman whos brought her digital camera a man with long ropey dreadlocks a girl with highlighted hair and precise bangs and a couple with a tiny baby sucking a pacifier they look more like theyre headed to a downtown wine bar than to a hightech product launch the fact that theyve given up their tuesday night to listen to westergren suggests that he has built something unique with almost all the seats filled westergren takes the stage hes donned a jacket for his moment in the spotlight although its teal zipup and made of fleece im tim westergren and im the founder of pandora he says the audience claps and shouts so ive done a bunch of these town halls and i am jacked up he says ask any questions you have about the company the more we can sort of talk to each other the better he means it as westergren details the battered history of his company the crowd laughs and claps and oohs and aahs westergren has that rare talent of seeming chatty and intimate with an audience of hundreds listeners raise their hands and suggest ways that pandora might outwit regulators others volunteer to view more ads on their pandora radio players if that will help the company make money its tough to imagine even the most rabid consumers like apples customers offering to view more advertising now its up to westergren to turn that adulation into action to save his company once again hes in a common enough position hes trying to make a real business of this product he passionately believes in but hes never quite gotten his baby out of startup mode still after eight years of being tossed around westergren isnt talking about just making pandora turn the corner he wants to make it huge pandora has developed a proprietary method to analyze musicwestergren calls it the music genomethat lets users create online radio stations generated by the softwares recommendations tell pandora your favorite song is casey jones by the grateful dead and within seconds it will create a stationcasey jones radiothat streams nonstop songs from artists such as the youngbloods the byrds and the beatles along with stuff you might not expect like rem the jam and tom petty its undeniably cool and completely addictive but pandora has never quite found its footing as a business indeed the company has been through an almost unbelievable number of setbacks a series of blows that would make the most determined entrepreneur throw in the towel westergren has run out of money which forced to him to lay off his entire staff except for those willing to work for free hes been rejected some  times by venture capitalists he has faced bankruptcy haggled with anxious creditors and been sued by employees deal after deal has fallen through at the last minute yet somehow westergren has managed to amass more than eight million very enthusiastic listeners advertisers like microsoft and lexus and a database of some  songs over the years hes raised more than  million in funding most recently an undisclosed amount from hearst interactive media the media companys venture capital arm in  ive got to give tim the alltime award for persistence i probably turned him down at least three or four times says peter gotcher a venture capitalist who eventually participated in a  million round in  i liked his passion and entrepreneurial spirit call it passion spirit an obstinate refusal to quit its kept pandora alive but now just when westergren thought hed finally moved pandora into safe territory hes facing his biggest battle yet steep hikes in music royalty rates that were announced earlier this year every time pandora plays a song it must pay a small fee to the musics publisher songwriter performer and label westergren has lobbied congress and organized a grassroots campaign of millions of internet radio listeners why the urgency the rate hike has sent pandoras operating expenses soaring and threatens to silence pandora for good westergren plays the piano the bassoon the recorder the drums and the clarinet his personal pandora stations are based on songs by muddy waters ben folds josh fix oscar peterson art farmer elvis costello and james taylor he studied music at stanfordstan getz was one of his professorsand graduated in  with a deep understanding of music theory and computer applications for music and a notion that he could somehow make money as a musician he played piano in a series of takingthemselvesseriously acoustic rock bands called late coffee and oranges barefoot and yellowwood junction but after years of driving a van all over the west coast crashing in friends basements he became frustrated with how hard it was to get noticed band life fell apart in  westergren started composing scores for lowbudget independent films and thats when he began thinking differently about music hed ask directors about the sounds they were searching for and listen as otherwise articulate creative people struggled to find the right words usually falling back on descriptions like something like natalie merchant but more scary sitting at his piano trying to evoke a frightening natalie merchant westergren thought about what terms such as scarier and darker and happier meant in purely musical terms would changing the rhythm the melody or the alto sax arrangement produce the desired result if so then wouldnt it be possible to create a giant database of music based on its underlying characteristics which would make it easier for listeners to find exactly what they were looking for around the same time he read an article about the plight of singersongwriter aimee mann though manns two previous records had sold a respectable  copies and won critical acclaim her record label was refusing to release her current effort it was focusing instead on blockbuster artists with sales in the millions for westergren manns story brought back bitter feelings about yellowwood junction which had built a strong following in the western united states but had no way to get its music out to larger audiences all the ideas that had been swimming in my head coalesced at that point he says lucky for him it was  and everyone in the bay area seemed to be starting a company westergren founded his savage beast technologies with two friends jon kraft and will glaser kraft whod already started and sold a tech business helped westergren sketch out a business plan glaser worked on the software and westergren worked on the music his premise was that music could be broken down in an objective way by trained musicians he called his effort the music genome project a riff on the drive to map human dna westergren began by thinking about how any musician would describe a piece of music and came up with about  qualities he hired a professional musicologist to refine the approach and glaser created an algorithm based on the work the system now includes about  different genes for each genre pop classical jazz and hiphop that break down the musics form the instruments used and their tone is the saxophone gravelly the level of virtuosity and the overall mood and style for classical music is the mood pastorale giocoso or agitato for jazz is there an rb or a smooth jazz influence it analyzes lyrical content along with harmony rhythm and pretty much any other factor you can think of westergren was insistent on having humans analyze each song arguing that computers alone would not be able to pick up the nuances and mood analysts rate each song on a point scale on each of the  attributes those ratings constitute the songs musical dna which is entered into a database the goal is to point listeners toward music they might enjoy based on an analysis of what they already like the question was how to make money with this thing in  westergren pitched the company as an ecommerce site that would recommend music based on the genome and in march he raised  million in venture capital two weeks later the stock market crashed rendering an underfunded ecommerce site a very bad idea the next four years saw a plethora of different business plans for pandora the first day i started i sat down with tim and i said tell me about the product says dan lythcotthaims who joined westergren in  and is now pandoras creative director he said no you tell us about the product there was no product just a loose idea westergren set out to license the genome to other sites as a recommendation engine but after more than a year his efforts resulted only in a meager  development fee from barnes  noblecom his next idea was to put the technology into instore kiosks at music retailers at the end of  westergren reached a licensing deal with aol music and best buy nysebby chose pandora over  competitors to run a trial kiosk program both deals stretched payments out over a few years but pandora already was deep in debt and the cash problems continued to mount by this point jon kraft had left and westergren had about  employees and  parttime music analysts on staff he paid office rent from his own checkbook the only solution he could think of was asking employees to defer their salaries there was this core group of people that just believed in it there was no quitting says lythcotthaims westergren meanwhile kept knocking on the doors of vcs hes a likable guy casual and wellinformed but the vcs objected to his business plan in its third iteration by now gotcher for example thought there were only a handful of customers in either the licensing or the kiosk business but i also thought tim was a refreshing entrepreneur he says most entrepreneurs if you bring up a flaw in the business model will just adamantly try to claim theyve got it all figured out tim said well thats our best idea right now it was a good reaction but the situation at the company was increasingly dire at the end of  four former employees slapped pandora with a lawsuit theyd discovered that deferring salaries was illegal a possibility westergren hadnt even considered he had to argue his case before the california division of labor standards which forced him to settle with the employees with the last of his remaining money he let the rest of the employees go though a few true believers continued to pitch in by now westergren had pitched pandora to venture capitalists about  times and had finally learned to hint that his was a hot investment that other vcs were about to pour money into it the best buy trial was also showing good results and westergren convinced walden venture capital to lead an  million round in  the money meant that westergren could hand out salary checks for  or  to employees who had been working for free meanwhile he and the board decided to bring in a new ceo they tapped joe kennedy a former saturn executive in spring  hiring a ceo with consumer experience turned out to be a prescient move six months after kennedy joined deals with borders nysebgp and best buy fell through and the company once again had to reinvent itself having exhausted their businesstobusiness ideas kennedy and westergren turned to the consumer market where online radio was an obvious option the company decided to develop a website offering personalized radio stations and charge  a year for subscriptions pandora radio runs counter to nearly every internet trend it eschews automation in favor of actual human musicians doing data entry unlike rival webcasters such as lastfm mog and rhapsody it ignores social networks and the wisdom of crowds in favor of expert selection its profoundly unscalable our method is really absurd in that regard westergren says that was the vcs biggest objection how could you use this approach given how much music is out there in the end the only way to answer that question is to look at the experience itself and to ask does this approach give you noticeably better results the site has a simple interface that asks users to enter a song or an artist they like pandora then streams a radio station that plays songs with a similar genome profile you can give thumbsup or thumbsdown votes to guide pandora or add additional seeds say youre in the mood for a power ballad and enter guns n roses patience as the seed song pandora will begin streaming similar songs that are slow heavy on guitar and cool sounding distant mornings by gustav and the seasick sailors a swedish rock band with slight folk influences and hell just aint the same by theory of a deadman a canadian band it delivers surprisesyoure tempted to dismiss cat stevenss hard headed woman immediately but then you find that it does sound kind of like patience you also can direct pandora if for instance you want more power and less ballad you can give cat the thumbsdown or add another seedsay aerosmiths what it takes now the mix changes to meat loaf u and surprisingly guided by voices and dinosaur jr a pair of postpunk bands that fit in well the genome doesnt work perfectly as westergren admits when you enter an eclectic artist like the beatles as a seed the system doesnt know which direction to takedo you want psychedelia like lucy in the sky with diamonds british invasion pop like love me do or electric blues like yer blues and for some reason it misfires altogether with beck and frank zappa still when you seed a station with a song rather than an artist and use the thumbsup or thumbsdown ratings to guide the system you end up with hours upon hours of very good radio pandora launched in september  after a quiet rollout to friends and family the company had to double capacity three times in the first week nobodynobodyhad dreamed it would be as popular as it was says lythcotthaims emails poured in gushing about how cool it was unfortunately westergrens latest business model turned out again to be not so cool pandora offered listeners  hours for free before requiring them to subscribe but users easily could log in with different email addresses and continue getting the free version fortunately by now westergren was a pro at as he puts it jumping to another lily pad pandora scrapped the subscription model and decided to make money via advertisements on its site users interacted with the site a lot to rate songs or refine their stations and every time they did so pandora could load a new ad it could offer advertisers segmentation so a lexus ad would be shown on a jazz station while a bet awards ad would be shown on a rap station soon the company was doubling the number of listeners every month investors liked the new model and gave the company another  million that was the most enjoyable year of my adult life westergren says pandora was working at last but just over a year later it would be in crisis mode again westergren was taking a bus to work on march  when his treo buzzed with a news alert he read it and called joe kennedy right away frantic the copyright royalty boardan arm of the library of congress that oversees radio stations royalty paymentshad changed the amounts that internet radio stations had to pay web radio stations are charged on a per listener per hour basis starting next year they will be charged on a per listener per song basis pandoras costs will almost triple to about three cents an hour for each listener the crb also added a new charge of  a year per individual stationwhich in pandoras case with its millions of personalized channels would be catastrophic the new fees would triple pandoras costs and westergren and kennedy debated shutting down immediately at the new rates says kennedy the business model falls apart soundexchange the body that collects royalties for the recording industry is lobbying for the increase arguing that artists and songwriters need to be paid when their music airs online broadcasters agree that some payment is necessary but argue that it should be at rates they can afford they insist that theyre helping market music that wouldnt otherwise be heard westergren for his part finds the rate change inherently unfair amfm broadcasters pay royalties only to publishers and songwriters not to artists or labels satellite radio stations pay a flat fee of less than  percent of revenue for royalties but the new system charges web broadcasters based on a range of factors many of them on the esoteric side such as whether use of the service serves to promote or substitute for record sales and the fees tend to be higher at an emergency meeting some board members argued that the company should fight the rates others suggested striking separate deals with the record labels themselves which was deemed unrealistic pandora uses music from more than  different labels it would be impossible to arrange agreements with all of them westergren rallied he began by calling other webcasters who together founded savenetradio then hired a dc lobbying firm qorvis which has done work for aol amazoncom and halliburton to get behind it the firm helped place opeds and solicit endorsements from nearly  artists and managers it arranged a tour of capitol hill where small groups of broadcasters and musicians met with congressional staffers explaining their side of the story the coalition also named june  a day of silence for web radio when listeners tuned in to pandora yahoo music live and other online broadcasters theyd hear no music just a message telling them about the rate changes and directing them to contact their representatives westergren realized he had a huge weapon in his arsenal his customers westergren sends a welcome email to everyone that signs up its an automated email from an alias address but whenever anyone replies he replies back last year when he was touring the country looking for new music westergren decided to begin holding meetings with listeners hed choose a locale post it on the pandora blog and invite anyone in the area to attend four people attended the first meetup in austin but as he traveled to a senior center in phoenix a taco joint in san antonio and a lecture hall at mit the groups grew and soon dozens even hundreds of listeners were attending all the effort spent courting nonpaying customers might seem excessive but it lets pandora spend next to nothing on marketing in any case the listeners responded some have become so fanatic that theyve written songs about the site sent boxes of fudge and even made donations that work turning customers into fans westergren realized meant he could rally them behind the royalty rate issue so he sent an email to all the pandora listeners that identified their representative and senator and asked them to write in pandorans responded westergren estimates that about one million emails phone calls or faxes were made or sent by pandora listeners california democratic senator dianne feinstein received  emails in the office of jay inslee a seattlearea representative correspondence about internet radio equaled that concerning the iraq war inslee and illinois representative don manzullo drafted a bill that brought internet radio rates in line with those of satellite stations in the senate sam brownback and ron wyden sponsored a companion bill i said oh my gosh this is a bombshell ready to explode with the small radio stations says manzullo the legislation has been referred to committee the bills show little chance of passing even manzullo points out that the last thing you want to do is have congress regulate royalty rates industry should regulate them but the threat of legislative action seems to have pushed soundexchange to the negotiating table the group has agreed to meet with broadcasters and is making conciliatory gestures both sides are working toward resolving it says john simon soundexchanges executive director these are our partners they pay us royalties we want to make sure internet radio survives and thrives because they do pay us the new fees kicked in on july  for now pandora is paying them as it hopes for a reprieve after the sfmoma announcement westergren stayed out until midnightlisteners were invited to a postparty at a south of market art gallery with pandora employeesbut he is in the office the next morning at  the offices are in a rundown section of oakland and look cashstrapped but cheerful there are beige cubicles but also columns painted with famous album covers and a metal cabinet full of free kit kats and slim jims over on the side of the room there are several rows of tables where the music analysts sit its an odd sight at a tech company thats pushing the music industry forward these rows of humans clicking through screens and mutely analyzing songs at a rate of two to six per hour all  of them work parttime they have an incredible knowledge of music on one job application for a music analyst opening the applicant sketched out the chord structure of david bowies life on mars another analyst explained the classical music genome which hasnt yet launched using terms like homophony versus polyphony versus antiphony even though he wasnt a classical musician the parttime arrangement gives analysts time to work on their own music and anyone who works  hours a week gets health insurance almost everyone that works here is an active working musician and an active working musician needs supplemental income says rick higgs a silverhaired analyst who teaches guitar you can hardly find anything better for a musician this stuff makes a lot more sense than landscaping at this early hour thanks to musicians schedules and last nights party theres no one in the office but westergren he has a bunch of interviews today hell talk to an npr reporter about the rate increase then chat about the same thing with a sympathetic podcaster named jeremy westergrens cell phone isnt working and the internet and voip in his office are both down with the forbearance that only eight years at pandora could give westergren isnt fazed he tries some different lines tries his cell phone and shrugs its not the first time things havent gone as planned and it wont be the last ive never ever given up even when we were in the most depressive bleak times he says i always thought it was a good idea and would have a day when the phone finally rings it turns out to be a listener calling with a question about his pandora station westergren jots down his number to call him back later hes finally got the adoring audience he always sought finally figured out how to make a living at music he thinks hes got it right at last if not another change of tune will be easy to make given all the practice hes

from when the company began  weve seen this movie before   years ago when we launched internet radio a lot of folks said the same thing – aol microsoft yahoo had large personalized radio products with big distribution but we built a much better product and here we are years later the king of that category we just think weve seen this before with the launch this week of pandora premium — the
