are eca marcellus trust holders about to get whxed  eca marcellus trust i nyseect  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»are eca marcellus trust holders about to get whxedmar  about eca marcellus ect tx value investor longshort equity oil  gasthis article will explain why investors are set to lose over  of their money with eca marcellus trust ect the key points ect is only worth its  net asset value currently x overvalued ects dividend is about to get cut  in the upcoming quarter which catches lots of holders off guard and revalues the stock much lower insiders just dumped a lot of stock mm shares there is increased selling pressure coming now that insiders just swapped their shares to eager sellers overview ect is a royalty trust essentially unit holders own a claim on a cash flow stream from marcellus gas wells  producing wells since natural gas wells decline unit holders get a declining dividend stream which is essentially a return of capital plus a small return unit holders are mainly retail investors in search of yield who often forget that they are mainly getting a return on capital and often mistakenly think their dividend or yield is safe and not declining even the wsj has been trying to make investors aware of the risks of some royalty trusts when investors realize their distributions arent as safe or sustainable as they thought royalty trusts sometimes have oh sht moments for example whx crashed from  to  last summer sdt is down  in a month and a half what is ect really worth ects asset value based on its yearend  reserve report filed an k on  values its claim on marcellus wells at a present value pv of mm share ect has a market cap of mm share that is a ridiculous disconnect ect has no new wells there is no new production or upside it is just a cashflow stream based on its declining production and natural gas prices while the reserve report was run using mmcfe and gas prices are mmcfe today if the report was run assuming natural gas prices of mmcfe  above todays prices the present value would only be mm that means if gas goes up  to mmcfe ect is still only worth unit at current gas prices its only worth unit there are much much cheaper ways to get exposure to natural gas prices and get income why pay  for something that will only pay out  worth of discounted dividends which gets taxed before it dissolves essentially worthless in  moreover  is the value of the cashflow stream but trust holders will soon have to pay an increasingly higher percentage of taxes on distributions down the road as accelerated depletiontax shielding runs out this is why trusts should trade at or below their pv value after activity is complete ect is x overvalued but investors are wrongly valuing it off its current unsustainably high yield instead of realizing they are getting a return of capital a return on capital that is about to start declining rather quickly  marcellus wells can decline up to  in year one some investors have looked at book value for valuation help thanks to you forbes but thats also irrelevant for ect the  reflected in the statements of assets liabilities and trust corpus as royalty interests in gas properties represents  trust units valued at  per unit the carrying value of the trusts investment in the royalty interests is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of such royalty interests ect was worth  when it was sold initially to the public but that was in june  when gas prices were near mmbtu now gas prices are  lower and the trust has paid out  of its reserves thanks daniel so the value is much much lower even if gas prices rebound in  years  of the value will have been distributed in a low gas price environment and the remaining reserves will only be worth a few dollars ect annual distribution outlook at mmcf   net asset value which will be even lower once tax shield rolls off what reprices ect to its net asset value  dividend cut coming like whx nothing changes until the oh sht moment ects could be coming through  ect had  common units and  subordinated units units that wont receive a distribution unless the trust makes enough money each quarter its the way the royalty trust was set up the last few quarters ect hasnt made enough to pay the subordinated holders didnt meet the subordinated threshold so all the money goes to the common unit holders retail investors havent really cared about subordinated shortfall because they are getting their increasing distributions and they are happy ects q distribution of  jumped to  in q thanks to increase in gas prices and sub units getting nothing not bad it looks like a  annualized yield but in reality income was just unit again ects distributions are mainly a return on capital not a steady income stream and it is currently worth  and it will be worth  after the  may distribution so heres where it gets interesting the  subordinated units flipped to common units at yearend  investors would know that if they read the q but most dont there are only  analysts that cover the trust none has a favorable view moreover the trust doesnt hold a conference call anymore it just collects checks from producing gas so the distribution that investors have been watching grow is about to get cut  in q announced in may why  cut from the subordinated units flipping to common production will be down because all wells are now online and declining decline is actually steepest in year one gas prices are down in q vs q the positive basis differential will be down in q vs q call and ask eca if you disagree with any of the above the  decline in distributions likely catches most investors who look at historical distributions and extrapolate forward completely off guard and the stock will crash ect has badly missed target distributions and subordinated threshold but investors distributions have been going up until now disguised insider selling it gets worse the sponsor of the royalty trust eca cleverly unloaded its position by swapping as much as it could of its ect position the subordinated units that are now common units for ngt units an expiring royalty trust its basically huge insider selling and of course eca would want to sell their position thats x overvalued this doesnt impact ect at all other than free up mm shares of the float and put those ect units in the hands of holders who are trying to monetize their remaining position of an expiring royalty trust ngt doesnt trade and is set to receive a  breakup value in august  eca the sponsor for ect gave ngt holders who will collect  in august a premium amount of their ect shares now  worth in order to unload their position and to incentivize ngt holders to take it …such consideration represents a  premium to the anticipated cash value that each ngt depositary unitholder choosing not to tender would receive upon the termination of ngt… this will likely result in selling pressure by ngt holders who tendered k ngt units for mm ect units who couldnt get out previously and wanted to profit from getting ect shares at a  discount conclusion insiders are unloading there will likely be increased selling pressure from new unit holders ect is x overvalued at current gas prices and unit holders are about to see their dividend get cut  sequentially in early may id hate to be holding this hot potato disclosure i am short ect i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article additional disclosure i put on a small short position after reading daniel moores article and doing additional work if you disagree with any of this analysis talk to an analyst to fact check it unfortunately ect will eventually crash to its net asset value just like whx did royalty trusts are great income products and a great way to invest in commodities but only when valued
