intimate abuseby mills linda glocking up men who beat their partners sounds like a tremendous improvement over the days when men could hit women with impunity and women fearing for their lives could expect no help from authorities but does our system of requiring the arrest prosecution and incarceration of abusers lessen domestic violence or help battered women in this already controversial but vitally important book we learn that the criminal justice system may actually be making the problem of domestic violence worse looking honestly at uncomfortable facts linda mills makes the case for a complete overhaul and presents a promising alternativethe evidence turns up some surprising facts about the complexities of intimate abuse facts that run against mainstream assumptions the current system robs battered women of what power they do hold perhaps as many as half of women in abusive relationships stay in them for strong cultural economic religious or emotional reasons jailing their partners often makes their situations worse women are at least as physically violent and emotionally aggressive as are men toward women and womens aggression is often central to the dynamic of intimate abuse informed by compelling evidence personal experience and what abused women themselves say about their needs mills proposes no less than a fundamentally new system addressing the real dynamics of intimate abuse and incorporating proven methods of restorative justice millss approach focuses on healing and transformation rather than shame or punishment already the subject of heated controversy insult to injury offers a desperately needed and powerful means for using what we know to reduce violence in our homesgeneral womens studiescondition hpb condition ratingsnew item is brand

outstanding resource for videobased online learning particularly if multimedia software or coding skills are what you need the price is attractive considering you get unfettered access to all the courses in lyndacoms catalog lyndacom from linkedin by jill duffy and jordan minor and molly k mclaughlin may   pm est may   editors rating excellent msrp  pros amazing library of more than  online learning courses deep training for advanced software particularly adobe products wellstructured site excellent video and audio quality wellvetted instructors cons no pervideo or percourse access equally helpful training videos sometimes available for free online bottom line lyndacom is an outstanding resource for videobased online learning particularly if multimedia software or coding skills are what you need the price is attractive considering you get unfettered access to all the courses in lyndacoms catalog lyndacom is one of the best sources for online learning for years lyndacom has put informative and clear videobased training in front of people who need it as part of linkedin it has added learning paths to help professionals gain new skills the videos let you work at your own pace and the website is designed to help you keep track of what you want to learn and what you have already learned the site is exceptional at teaching technical skills and technique such as photography and coding beyond multimedia training lyndacom also helps people pick up business principles moneymanagement advice and much more when you need skills training fast lyndacom is the goto source for highquality results and a pcmag editors choice compare similar products compare khan academy   treehouse   codecademy   sitepoint   code avengers   safari books online by oreilly media   codecombat   codehs   code school   free code camp   inform    twine   general assembly dash   price and plans lyndacom is a subscriptionbased service some videos are made available free to help you preview courses but you really need a subscription to get to the valuable meat of this online learning site you can try the service free for  days but youll have to enter a credit card for access alternatively you can try it out via linkedin learning for one month which also requires a credit card or paypal account on file you can sign up on lyndacom with a unique login or sign in using your linkedin account a basic plan costs  per month or if you are billed annually  per month it includes unlimited access to all the videos lyndacom has to offer in other words rather than paying for a course you pay for unlimited access to everything in the catalog that flexibility is one of the key features of lyndacom separating it from other online learning services such as the great courses which charge you per course the basic plan comes with a few limitations you cant download project files or watch any of the videos offline on a mobile device if you pony up the  per month premium subscription fee you get project files opting for the  per year premium account gets you offline viewing access note that offline viewing isnt included for premium members who pay by the month group pricing is also available on request for four or more people lyndacom has apss for android appletv ios and windows though lyndacoms prices are completely reasonable for the highquality training you receive there are ways to get similar content free khan academy is perhaps the bestknown website with a vast and evergrowing series of videos that help you learn all kinds of stuff while excellent khan academy started out teaching academic material such as economics and algebra so you might not find the exact skills training that you need there lyndacom excels at teaching software programs particularly multimedia software and professional techniques for using them if you need a crash course in the latest features of photoshop or indesign lyndacom is sure to have them online quickly whereas with khan its a crapshoot excellent features for getting started as mentioned you do need to enter credit card details or a paypal account just to try out the site if you forget to cancel within your tenday window you will be charged once youve set that up lyndacom asks you what youd like to accomplish improve at my job change my career or job learn skills or build an app or a website if you choose one of the first three options youll be asked to choose your job or interests in order to get recommendations if you opt to build an app or a website youll be directed to suggested learning paths such as become an ios app developer and courses such as foundations of programming fundamentals hover over a learning path tile to see the number of courses included click through and you can see potential salary ranges and the number of hours the courses will take course recommendations also include the time commitment level and the number of views you can preview courses before diving in programming courses are broken down into a series of short videos most of which are just a few minutes long you can skip videos if you want or read the transcript instead another convenient feature is the ability to add them to a playlist you can also find courses by searching keywords or browsing the alphabetized library lyndacoms videos and help im continually impressed with the quality of lyndacoms videos the player is large with a few tabs below it for the video overview transcript view offline and exercise files the transcript tab has the full text of the video and it highlights a few words at a time to sync up with the presenters voice thats impressive and amazingly helpful if the speaker talks too quickly or you just didnt catch what she or he said exercise files are available with premium accounts and let you follow along with the instructor as he or she demonstrates lessons protip if you sign up for lynda on linkedin—branded as linkedin learning—you can access exercise files during your free trial lyndacom really sets a high bar for sound and image quality as well the presenters are informative and rehearsed but also relaxed like with khan academy i really trust that these people are experts lyndacom also highlights a variety of courses for those trying to pick up some new coding skills hundreds of courses and tens of thousands of video tutorials cover web development and design topics for beginners and experts alike the catalog features classes from the foundations of programming to specialized lessons on user interface responsive design and mobile app development some courses even feature expert opinions from legitimate titans of their respective industries such as game designer brenda romero and teachers will be pleased to know that many tutorials including some free ones are specifically targeted at children while lyndacoms coding lessons lack the helpful interactivity of a service like khan academy and treehouse an editors choice for paid learntocode services they make up for it with a much greater breadth and depth of content treehouse adds an extra touch with popups of important keyboard shortcuts and visual representations of coding symbols the quality of the videos is also a lot more consistent compared with udemys large open marketplace when you complete a course lyndacom offers a certificate which doesnt necessary bear any weight in the real world but is useful for when an employer wants proof of your training before reimbursing you for a course if you connect your account with linkedin you can add these certificates to your profile as well the site doesnt skimp when it comes to support outside of the training material a tollfree phone number international telephone number and email submission form all offer channels for technical support or to answer your questions youll find plenty of additional help files online too quality to spare lyndacom delivers highquality painstakingly detailed content especially for highend software members can watch the same videos as many times as they need at any time of day wherever they have an internet connection and appropriate videostreaming capabilities with a premium subscription paid annually you can even download videos to a mobile device to watch them offline while you certainly can spend your time hunting down free online videos to learn the skills youll pay to learn on lyndacom lyndacom removes the hunting and scrubbing through illlighted amateur youtube videos to give you what you need plainly and simply if youre the type of person who needs a live instructor to answer your precise questions lyndacom might not offer enough for you but be warned that one live course could cost you three times as much as a months worth of access lyndacom is our editors choice for online learning pcmag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page these commissions do not affect how we test
