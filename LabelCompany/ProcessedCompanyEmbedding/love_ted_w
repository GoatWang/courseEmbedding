transition about kalobios kalobios pharmaceuticals inc is developing a portfolio of proprietary patienttargeted firstinclass monoclonal antibodies designed to treat severe lifethreatening or debilitating diseases for which there is an unmet medical need with a clinical focus on severe respiratory diseases and cancer currently kalobios has advanced three programs to clinical development kba is an antipcrv mab fragment partnered exclusively with sanofi pasteur and is being developed for the prevention and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa pa infection kalobios has retained rights for the cystic fibrosis cf indication and is conducting a  patient phase  study in cf subjects with chronic pa lung infection kalobios has received orphan drug designation from both the us fda and the european medicines agency for kba for the treatment of pa lung infection in cf patients sanofi is pursuing a ventilatorassociated pneumonia prevention indication in the intensive care setting an indication which has received us fda fast track designation kb is an antiepha mab with potential in treating hematologic malignancies and solid tumors kalobios is running an ongoing phase  study evaluating kb in hematologic malignancies the phase  dose escalation portion of that study in subjects with hematologic malignancies is ongoing kalobios initiated the phase  expansion portion of the study focused on patients with certain epha positive hematologic malignancies in early  kb is an antigmcsf mab with potential to treat inflammatory diseases that was being developed for the treatment of severe asthma a phase  clinical study in  patients with severe asthma has been completed in the united states europe and australia which did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in fev from baseline as compared to placebo  kalobios has discontinued development of this compound in severe asthma and is continuing to analyze the phase  data to review with thought leaders and evaluate other possible indications in order to determine next steps if any in the development of kb all of the companys antibodies were generated using its proprietary humaneered® technology a method that converts nonhuman antibodies typically mouse into recombinant antibodies that have a high binding affinity to their target and are designed for chronic therapeutic use the company believes that antibodies produced using its humaneered® technology offer important clinical and economic advantages over antibodies generated by other methods in terms of high binding affinity high manufacturing yields and minimal to no immunogenicity inappropriate immune response upon repeat administration in humans for more information on kalobios pharmaceuticals please visit our web site at httpwwwkalobioscom forward
