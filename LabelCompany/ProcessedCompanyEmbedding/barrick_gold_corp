seen steady gains in  following the incredible run up in  precious metal producers such as barrick gold corp tsxabxnyseabx have split from following the run up in gold prices and have actually dropped barrick’s stock price has retreated nearly  year to date over the course of the past month period that drop is an even more concerning  that’s not to say that barrick hasn’t performed well over the past few years the company’s efforts to improve efficiency and slash costs have seen the company go from us billion in debt and high costs to just us billion in debt barrick has achieved one of the most efficient operations in the business in a little over two years the company has even mentioned the prospect of being completely debtfree within a decade as impressive as these developments have been barrick’s recent drop is more to do with the company missing on q results which were exasperated by barrick calling for lower production at its veradero mine in argentina while barrick can and will weather this temporary storm there is downward pressure on the stock which is also weakened by the current environment in the gold market what happened to the gold market the current woes in the gold market aren’t limited to barrick on a macro basis nearly all producers are feeling a pullback in prices which is due to a variety of factors historically gold has been viewed as a safe store of wealth this view is being reconsidered by investors that aren’t attached to gold itself but rather the opportunity that it represents the reason that gold was a safe store of wealth was that it was and still is rare in high demand and has a steadily increasing price the more investors purchased it the higher the price went turning to more recent events there are several developments that are bringing into question that long established view cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are now challenging the safestoreofwealth and increasingvalue viewpoints bitcoin has surged this year more than doubling in value year over year with no end in sight for the more connected investors the returns on cryptocurrencies are too good to ignore another point worth considering is interest rates the us fed has already raised rates this year and now canada has followed suit industry experts speculate that one more hike in the us is likely later this year given the roller coaster of a ride that gold has been on in recent years some investors may start to reconsider their precious metal investment in lieu of another that is appreciative of the changes underway in the economy is barrick a good investment barrick’s production woes will be resolved and the company will return to higher production later this year barrick’s efforts at slashing away debt will also continue to make strides and place the company in a much better standing over time the stock may continue to drop before those improvements take place in my opinion investors looking to buy into barrick may soon see an opportunity to do so at a discounted rate whereas existing shareholders should wait out the current storm canadas answer to amazoncom youve probably never even heard of this upandcoming ecommerce

miners team up in chilean venture goldcorp shares fall most since november after deals announced goldcorp ceo says project pipeline quite full right now in the dark days of the commodities meltdown mining companies turned to partnerships to lower costs and survive now as prices recover they’re hooking up for growth  or at least the possibility of itcanada’s two biggest gold miners barrick gold corp and goldcorp inc are teaming up to develop a goldcopper deposit in chile as part of a complex chain of transactionsthe cultures of the two companies are in many ways opposites where goldcorp has been focused on boosting production barrick has repeatedly stressed that its priority is improving cash flow through better margins barrick’s latest joint venture with goldcorp means it’s off the hook for the initial development costs associated with a large project in the maricunga mineral belt in exchange for handing over control of part of the assetunder terms of separate deals announced tuesday goldcorp will acquire  percent of the barrickcontrolled cerro casale project in chile goldcorp will also buy kinross gold corp’s  percent total interest in the deposit for  million upfront as well as other deferred payments and a royalty making barrick and goldcorp equal partners at the sitemeanwhile through the acquisition of exeter resource corp goldcorp will buy the caspiche project just  kilometers  miles from cerro casale adding it to the new venture’s project mix‘long time’by combining cerro casale and caspiche goldcorp believes it can reduce the capital burden to develop the area and eventually generate a better return chief executive officer david garofalo said in an interview“it will be a long time before we put a shovel in the ground on these properties” garofalo said tuesday by phone “but if we don’t tuck them into our portfolios and advance them we’re never going to get them to a point where we actually can make an investment case” goldcorp fell  percent to c at  pm in toronto after tumbling  percent the biggest intraday drop since nov  barrick declined  percent and kinross was down  percentminers are wading back into the deal pool following years of austerity that staunched investments in future production exploration budgets are rising and miners are looking to acquire assets through partnerships or outright purchases goldcorp will continue to look for opportunities garofalo said in the interview tuesday although he noted that large deposits are increasingly difficult to find  “i’d dearly love to buy more of them they’re just not available and i’d certainly love to do more of these collaborate deals with pure companies like barrick” garofalo said “we’re talking to all of our peers about these types of transactions because the industry has been suffering a downward trajectory in its reserves for five years now”gaining ‘optionality’goldcorp will spend  million toward barrick’s portion of the initial development costs over five years  million of which will be covered by giving barrick half of caspiche once that deal closes and it’s added to the assetfrom barrick’s perspective this moves development of the deposit forward at no additional cost to its shareholders president kelvin dushnisky said in a statement “this agreement will allow us to direct capital elsewhere in our portfolio while ensuring shareholders retain exposure to the optionality associated with one of the largest undeveloped gold and copper deposits in the world”the deal is “strategically neutral” for barrick andrew quail an analyst at goldman sachs group inc said in a research note but could be positive insofar as it represents a move toward risksharing among large miners he saiddushnisky and barrick executive chairman john thornton have said they would consider partnerships as a way of developing assets in chile and elsewhere in  barrick agreed to sell a  percent interest in its zaldivar copper mine in chile to antofagasta plc for  billion barrick ceo discusses deal strategy in february interviewfor goldcorp the announcements tuesday are a “slight strategic negative” quail wrote “we believe this transaction highlights the company’s lack of largescale organic growth projects when compared to its peers” such as barrick and newmont mining corp he wroteas part of its deal with kinross goldcorp will also acquire  percent of kinross’s interest in the quebrada seca exploration project adjacent to cerro casale and will give barrick a royalty interest on gross revenues derived from both projectsclick here for details on today’s transactionsgoldcorp has joint ventures with barrick at the pueblo viejo mine in the dominican republic and with vancouverbased teck resources ltd at the nuevaunion project in chile last year goldcorp bought canadian explorer kaminak gold corp in a c million share swap“particularly in chile and peru it makes sense to work in mining clusters where operations can join to share infrastructure” cesar
