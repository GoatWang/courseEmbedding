was the highest rated foundation at misskatcom asian beauty site with tons os reviews wonderful i have such dry skin but this is just fine its super smooth and doesnt feel chalky at all not too matte but not too shiny which i sometimes felt with the stila ipf the compact is gorgeous and i can travel with it comes with a cloth pouch and there is a compartment to keep the sponge separate from the product or i use a brush for lighter coverage i dont wear much makeup but this is so fast and looks so natural it is defn going to be used up by me and it is a godsend in this hot humid weather chantecaille just makes such superquality products the only thing that would make this even better is if it had a high spf i am a fs cream and bamboo seems to be a prefect matchhmmm its two weeks later since i wrote the review i still love the chantecialle but i think that my skin is getting paler bc the bamboo isnt the same match i just need to find another one i hope but it is still

am more reviews by ammit age  skin combination fair neutral hair brunette straight fine eyes hazel hands down the absolute best powder foundation ive ever owned i heard great things about this and finally purchased it a couple of months ago petal is my perfect shade and it gives my skin a very natural polished and airbrushed look to it i normally apply my foundation as normal and then wear this on top sort of like a finishing powder but it really does add a bit of extra coverage it isnt cakey even if you apply it with the sponge and the colour match is absolutely perfect id say that this is imperceptible on the skin to be quite honest with you and i would recommend it to anyone who asked me what good powder compact they should buy this always this i did sort of want more coverage mainly because thats what i expected from this but it hasnt let the product down in any way its perfect on top of tm the cons are that this is an expensive purchase for sure and after  months of daily use i have already hit pan on it in the very centre which has disappointed me somewhat but also alerted me to the fact that this is a staple in my routine and one that i do not wish to be without i have tried other foundations in the past which have sat on top of my skin not matched very well or looked too obvious and this is just its just understated classic and elegant i may even buy a second one to keep in my baga little note on the compact it gets scruffy looking fairly easily because its so shiny and beautiful at the start and its constantly being thrown in my makeup bag but it is quite expensive looking and pretty  it has a nice mirror and a compartment under the powder with a decent sponge in it  it is the perfect travel companion and looks elegant and beautiful i highly doubt ill be swapping this for anything else anytime soon its on of those products report abuse  of  people found this helpful cinerem on   pm more reviews by cinerem age  skin combination fair neutral hair brunette wavy medium eyes blue chantecaille compact makeup was my first foray into more nicheinaccessible highend makeup based on online swatches i blindly chose the color petal for my nw skin petal is neutral with a slight tinge of pink to date i have not been able to find a better match for my skin in terms of shade and undertone the second closest foundation match ive been able to find is the ysl top secrets bb cream in clearthe foundation powder is housed in a metallic silver moon its definitely one of the larger compacts in my collection and its size is comparable to that of the shu uemura lightbulb oleopact like the lightbulb the top of the compact is domed so you cant really stack other things on top of it ive seen reviews of this product online and some pictures show it coming in a beautiful drawstring pouch i ordered this product from nordstrom about  years ago and it did not come with a pouch despite the larger size i do appreciate chantecailles attention to detail with the packaging the general feeling is one of weighted luxury and this compact puts my chanel purchases to shame and gives my guerlain powders a run for their money the mirror is generously large and ill often use it for touchups when im onthego the compartment below the powder has venting to allow the thick plush sponge to dry between uses the compact snaps shut securely and ive never had any issues with it opening and wreaking havoc on the contents of my bagin terms of formula this is my hg pressed powder foundation id say it sets to a natural matte coverage can be built up to almostbutnotreally medium for me the main selling point is the enhancement of skin texture my pores seem smaller and theres a general appearance of smoothness this overall sense of evenness combined with textural refinement means that a thick layer of spackle isnt required to get a polished look my skin still looks like skin with both powder brush and sponge application the powder itself has a creamy texture when some powders get to that panned state they crumble even if you look at them the wrong way that hasnt occurred with this foundation about  of the pan is showing at the moment and i know ill be able to use it up to the endive made this formula work for me despite skin type fluctuations i am tremendously clogprone this product has never exacerbated my acne and was one of the few products id turn to when my skin was being extra temperamental i used it when i was younger and my skin was considerably oilier i would still have oil breakthrough after  or  hours but given the volume of oil pumped out of my skin thanks crappy genetics this was considerable longevity even at the end of a workday the majority of my foundation would still be in tact with some fading around the chin and nose i am currently on a course of accutane and this foundation still holds its own even though the oil production in my skin has halted my skin is desert dry but with an extra layer of moisturizer only a bit of dryness shows around my mouth at the end of the workday anyone who is familiar with the effects of accutante will know how incredible that is overall if you are seeking a balance of coverage and textural perfection and can stomach the chantecaille price i wholeheartedly recommend this foundation im a foundation addict and i havent looked twice at another pressed powder since i bought this report abuse  of  people found this helpful tgivens on   pm more reviews by tgivens age  skin oily fairmedium not sure hair brown other other eyes hazel let me just start by saying i have never liked a product enough to write a review i have been searching for quite some time now for a powder foundation to stand up to my oily skin i live in florida and between my oily tzone and humidity make up usually melts right off this powder foundation lasts for a solid  hours and keeps the oil under control it is easy and quick to apply i use a powder brush as it goes on quick and even this is not a full coverage make up it goes on light and feels like you dont have any make up on for me this is a plus i dont like my face to feel heavy although this is expensive it is well worth it not the largest color selection but i was able to wear dune which worked okay this brand is also cruelty free which is very important to me update  i have not continued to use this makeup i do still highly recommend it but the color selection needs to be expanded dune is the closest i could find to my skin tone but looked pink is certain lighting for a very expensive makeup it needs to be perfect there is no compromising on a  compact report abuse  of  people found this helpful deandra on   am more reviews by deandra age  skin sensitive fair neutral hair blond straight medium eyes blue this is one of the best powder foundations ever created its excellentin the store the lighting made it difficult to choose the correct color i walked out of there with a lovely neutral shade called bamboo only to find after two days that it was much too dark for me neiman marcus was surprisingly very kind and understanding about letting me exchange it for a different color and i was glad because  is a lot to spend on foundation shell ended up being a better match for my skin the compact has a mirror in the lid and a hidden compartment with a circular sponge like stilas illuminating powder foundation if you were ever a fan of that this compact has a more elegant look and feel than stilas or macs and i guess the higher price tag gets you better packaging the compact is so handyat home i use a brush to apply instead of the sponge because i find i dont need much coverage can be light or medium depending on how you apply ive only used it dry one of the ladies at nm told me it can be used wet but i have not tried it that way this is lighter feeling on the skin than my bare escentuals original foundation i realize be costs half as much but also chantecaille gives me a better finish and does a better job of hiding flaws the name sounds french but the powder is made in italy it seems to melt into the skin the sa almost put me in petal when i exchanged bamboo but i was afraid that was too light and pinkish delicate rose ivories dont work out for me they usually wash me out if petal is neutral in different light it might be right for winter when i am more pale again its so hard to tell in the store shell is relatively neutral with a slightly yellow undertone normally i wear it over a sunscreen product that contains titanium dioxide and i really think shell blends softly and believably into my skin the sa said both colors could work for me i am using a powder brush most of the time rather than the sponge and not caking it onim no stranger to powder foundations macs studio fix powder foundation is one of my fallback favorites but this powder is more finely milled and lesshmmpowderylooking again chantecaille is expensive so you have to decide how much youre willing to spend another selling point that will appeal to some buyers this powder does not go ghostly on you when photographed its also fragrancefreei think a great liquid foundation is probably better for my combination sensitive skin when i need more coverage than this sometimes my bare skin looks lovely but sometimes i get acne and need to conceal it all pressed powders run the risk of adding a zit because of ingredients that hold the powder together in that handy little cake this foundation is really best for skin that just needs a little help but not a major fix for problem skin there are better choicesmy love for a good powder foundation comes from a desire to simplify i get busy and when im in a hurry powders are so quick to apply for weekend jaunts a run to the market or yikes a surprise visit from a neighbor i love the convenience of this i dont always have time to apply primer deftly blend liquid foundation with a sponge and follow with finishing powder sometimes i hit the snooze button you know i put a dusting of chantecaille compact makeup on this morning and its still comfortable on my combination skin at pm i did touch up twice with mac blot powder in the t zonenow that i know shell is my color match at least in summer i will probably buy it again after i run out even though  is costly report abuse  of  people found this helpful sonia on   am more reviews by sonia age  skin very dry fair cool hair brown kinky fine eyes blue skintype very dspwthis is a light to medium coverage foundation it doesnt cover pimples that well they seem to poke thru even if you try to cake it however in saying that it has the best antishine staying power ever i use this on the very humid  hot west australian days  degress celsius if you are looking for a light coverage foundation with great staying power and have pretty good skin already this foundation is for you edit i just picked this up again for the first time in  years it really is specatcular its sits so finely milled on my dry skin and it leaves my skin looking poreless and glassy without sitting in lines damn i love it petal is a great match for my uber ppp skin dont be put off it applies and wears much lighter than it appears in the pan great packaging too d however its not very forgiving on very very dry skin i wouldnt recommend it for winter wear report abuse  of  people found this helpful chevalierbossu on   am more reviews by chevalierbossu age  skin very dry fair not sure hair black curly fine eyes black i got this in shade shell i am quite fair and i find this shade just right though im thinking about getting the nw shade petal as well thinking since it is so light and natural it wont be artificial to use the whiter and pinkier shade petal shell is natural on my face its almost like i havent done make up it just light up complexion i have both used it with or without a makeup base i of course prefer a makeup base because in the afternoons without the help of a makeup base it falls off or melt a biti pair it with dior radiant base this combo light up my face i look alive i am happy with the golden microshimmer contained radiant base and then a thin layer of this chantecaille im quite happy that i dont look too melty after  hoursbut note that it is more lean to weak coverage side i will give it a  out of  for coverage if  is full score really weak so for people who dont have good skins conditions  most of us are like that unfortunately it doesnt cover at all it highlights the good skin but doesnt help disguise bad skin you need to have a good base  primer  foundation and then apply this compact use it alone it only helps to light up your skin a bit and helps to even out discoloration a little but it doesnt give any coveragestill a bit drying even chantecaille claim its moisturizing but i dont expect a compact to do the moisturizing workmy skin feels extremely dry so i find this compact isnt too bad report abuse  of  people found this helpful littleanita on   am more reviews by littleanita age  skin combination fairmedium neutral hair brown relaxed fine eyes brown its the best compact ever i will definitely buy it agnits sheer nature give your skin beautiful glowi got the peach coulor its perfectly match with my skintone report abuse  of  people found this helpful tulipsplash on   am more reviews by tulipsplash age  skin normal fairmedium neutral hair blond straight fine eyes green per paula begouncoverage polished natural and sheer especially for a powder foundation wears more like a pressed powderapplication smooth and evenfinish natural matte not dry or chalkyshade selection beautiful but each goes on lighter than it looks in the pan must test driveappropriate skintype best for normal to dry or slightly oily i would have to say that i agree with paulas critique i love to wear this over my sunscreen however the biggest selling point for me was the shade selection i have a very hard time finding foundation colors that match me my skintone is in the family of nwnw but the mac products look chalky on me if you have pink peach and yellow undertones and if you find that most foundations wear too yellow or too pinky beige on you chantecaille compact makeup in peach just might work it did for me report abuse  of  people found this helpful girllovepurple on   pm more reviews by girllovepurple age  skin dry fairmedium not sure hair brown other other eyes brown this is the best powder foundation ive ever used  comparing to channel armani ysl guerlain and nars etc i have dry skin so generally i am not doing very well with powder but this one is different the texture is so smooth that it went on my face than disappear yet i can tell all my pores and minor imperfections were covered and it lasted quite long time  my face was still fresh after a long night going out its amazing im nw and peach is perfect for me report abuse  of  people found this helpful karens on   am more reviews by karens age unknown skin combination other not sure hair blond other other eyes brown i love my chanel mat lumiere but was worried that  aurore was a little too dark we have such a poor colour selection in the uk i need to get a better shade in the us soon i decided to try chantecaille compact makeup after reading the fab reviews herei bought mine at spacenk for gulp � approx  what a waste of money this seems to be nothing more than a tinted powder the shade cashew is a better colour on me than my hg chanel although my dd thought it was a little too light but the texture feels dry and powdery accentuating any dry areas and making the skin around my eyes look crepey  ouch as for coverage what coverage i was oily and needed to use a blotting sheet after a couple of hours at least  with chanel the packaging is bulky and dare i say it cheap looking having used and loved other chantecaille products i was really disappointed with this  not to say miffed at my expensive mistake im
