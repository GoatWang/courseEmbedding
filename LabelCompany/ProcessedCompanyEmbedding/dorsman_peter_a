region twenty years after the handover hong kong’s future is more uncertain than ever june   was one of those rainy days that are typical for the summer months in hong kong wet humid weather with massive downpours that tend to render umbrellas useless light rain started as governor chris patten said goodbye to his residence in the afternoon and a torrent of rain enveloped hms tamar where british forces beat their retreat culminating when the prince of wales delivered the queen’s farewell notes  mainland chinese officials argued that the rain washed away the stain of colonialism others pointed out that the gods were crying as a free and prosperous hong kong was delivered to an uncertain future​self governmentwhatever it was on that very day chris patten made it very clear what the new order would be after his departure by stating that  “now hong kong people are to run hong kong” not only was this the core belief on which he had staked his political legacy it was vested in the territory’s constitution the basic law it basically said that hong kong would get to manage its own affairs and issues of defence and foreign relations fell into the lap of beijing as the sovereign entity with ultimate control a deal that is guaranteed to last until  the fiftieth anniversary of the handover the rationale for that timeframe was simple britain and china – at the time under margaret thatcher and deng xiaoping – agreed that china needed time to catch up with the citystate’s living standards and seamless integration of hong kong into the motherland would take some time and that is why today on the face of it hong kong is still pretty much what it was twenty years ago a selfgoverning entity separated by borders from mainland china and enjoying levels of freedom that are simply not present anywhere in the people’s republicyet things have changed quite a bit since that rainy day twenty years ago the hong kong press even before the handover started to selfcensor while beijing has kept a tight lid on elections it remains impossible for prodemocracy antigovernment parties to obtain a majority in the city’s parliament the legislative council what is more its citizens do not have a say in who gets to be its chief executive effectively hong kong’s leader who came to replace the job previously held by the british governor the current leader leung hunying is like the first chief executive tung cheehwa a beijing friendly business leader a background that is seen to balance the political need to remain close to the motherland while ensuring the interests on hong kong’s economy are met next week the job will go to carrie lam the first woman to hold the position and a civil administrator who will face the near impossible task to succeed where all of her predecessors pretty much failed to get the people of hong kong to at the very least accept work with and place its trust in its own administration it will require the one thing where businesspeople and civil administrators normally fail applying political skills and the reason for that simply is that they’re not elected have never really campaigned and are thus not really in synch with what the people on the street want and expectback in the s and s hong kong’s powerful business elites solidly aligned themselves with the leadership in beijing in order to ensure a stable business environment – which in hong kong means keep developing pricey real estate unhindered what is good for hong kong’s economy is good for local stability and that is best for the leadership in beijing or so the reasoning went china’s key strategic goal has always been to prove that integration into the mainland works so that the same model could be repurposed for the main prize peaceful reintegration of taiwan into the people’s republic the warm relationship between hong kong’s wealthy elites and the chinese leadership seems to have solidified the relative calm over the territory’s first twenty years under chinese rule but it was not always easy as china was well aware of the resentment towards the motherland beijing leaders reportedly were puzzled by statements from some business leaders in the runup to the handover that ‘hong kong people were yearning to join the motherland again after years of colonial oppression’ nothing of course was further reform the truth as the citystate’s population never saw itself as suffering under british rule on the contraryhong kong’s identityone of the things that i recall from my hong kong days is the unambiguous way in which the former british crown colony’s residents define their status in general they consider themselves to be hong kong residents or possibly hong kong chinese but that is more often to underline their ethnicity not their nationality residents of hong kong are proud and when asked about it and will rarely if ever say that they are from china and the reason for that is simple most of them are not in fact the very large majority of hong kong residents ran away from china during mao’s reign of terror and their descendants through the years forged a very different identity culturally and economically over  years of british rule created an ethnically diverse open market where trade the rule of law and political stability created a turbocharged and self confident city state with its own dialect and customs that had it not been for some historical flukes would have remained a set of sparsely populated coastal islands with fisheries as the main economic driver​but while business and culture flourished having over seven million people crammed on a small plot of land does pose its environmental challenges even during the end of british rule it had become clear that issues like housing development and pollution could no longer be effectively handled by a benign colonial administration  in the wake of the handover it became even clearer that the interests of a beijingappointed business elite stood diametrically opposed to the wants and needs of a population that despite its growing wealth had a vested interest in ensuring that the citystate would remain livable the call for more democracy and freedom was not a hollow one it was a genuine quest to sit at the table and determine what hong kong should look like there was limited interest in it from becoming a polluted metropolis much like other chinese urban centers where development and economic growth trumped everything else a quick health check with the hong kong chinese diaspora in places like sydney and vancouver will tell you that the combination of political uncertainty and quality of life was more than enough to leave for better and above all greener pastures  protest all of the discontent culminated in the  street protests in hong kong that became known as the umbrella revolution a series of street protests in reaction to beijing tightening of hong kong’s electoral rules now hong kong has a long tradition of outspoken politicians and legislators who have made it their life’s work to ensure beijing’s power is kept in check ranging from the feisty emily lau waihing to the calm and measured martin lee however these were the more traditional prodemocracy personalities who despite their disdain for beijing’s undemocratic approach sought to play within the unfortunately tight framework in which they had to operate always facing a probeijing majority they accepted the hand they were dealt and managed to present hong kong’s as effectively as possiblebut out of the umbrella revolution a new crop of youthful activists has emerged and they have been willing to take the debate a step further than the laulee generation with some resounding wins during the  legislative elections which are essentially unwinnable against progovernment parties some fresh young candidates pushed what now has become known as the ‘localist’ line openly calling for hong kong’s independence from china the most noteworthy ones were sixtus baggio leung chunghang and yau waiching who both successfully contested seats in the election under a proindependence banner in doing so they were pursuing both a logical conclusion to hong kong’s postumbrella prodemocracy movement while at the same time crossing the very line that is guaranteed to spell deep trouble openly calling for secession from the chinese motherland they crossed the one line that no one was supposed to cross and in opening the door to beijing’s retribution both leung and yau were eventually disqualified from taking their seats after intentionally using their oathofoffice taking ceremony in the new legislative council to display their total disrespect for china as hong kong’s sovereign masterwhile their actions were qualified as ‘immature’ or ‘unnecessarily provoking’ both leung and yau thought it would be their one and only chance to make their prohong kong prodemocracy case for all the world to see while baiting china into showing its hand and through their local intermediaries china did indeed take that bait beijing found a legal route to boot them out of their elected seats and the hong kong administrative apparatus dutifully complied to ensure that the territory’s elected body remained unanimously loyal to the motherlandnextthe localist movement was much like the arab spring or the populist movements that are shaking western democracies right now a logical outcome of unleashing tensions that the system could no longer contain and it was an outcome that was inevitable the young hong kong protestors and localist activists not only acted out what they felt as citizens of hong kong they demanded exactly what they were explicitly promised on that rainy day twenty years ago that now it was the people of hong kong who would call the shots in their own home and by showing their hand now the chinese overlords made it abundantly clear that hong kong’s freedom to manoeuvre under the basic law is and will remain minimal​so we are into twenty years of ‘one country two systems’ and in a way the countdown to the next benchmark date has started as thirty years is not all that far away the basic law has no firm expiry date but based on recent developments there is good reason to believe that on june   hong kong lose its unique postion and will become what most have feared would be the most undesirable outcome a chinese city like any other personal note i lived and worked in hong kong in the  period and witnessed the build up to the eventual handover and the first few years when the territory tried to find its way under its new sovereign rulers i had the pleasure to meet both chris patten his book ‘east and west’ about his time in asia is highly recommended reading as well as tung cheehwa and to this day remain fascinated and intrigued by what i consider to be one of the best and most dynamic places on this planet in a recent talk i branded hong kong turbocultural which i define as a multicultural entity where ethnic differences are minimal and all potential tensions are subordinated to the greater good of economic success to which most if not all residents have accessphotos cotton tree drive leading from central up to the midlevels on hong kong island photo from december  and localist politicians sixtus baggio leung chunghang and yau waiching   comments book review the mandibles by lionel shriver   comment   is a monetary crisis the real threat and if yes what will it look like while climate change appears to be the one existential threat to civilization to some and mass immigration to others it can be argued that the far more imminent one is monetary collapse lionel shriver takes on this theme in her latest novel ‘the mandibles a family ’ in it she paints an in my opinion unusually realistic view of how a once wealthy family is reduced to poverty and famine as the value of the once mighty us dollar evaporates shriver’s trademark approach is to take on some current issue and frame it into a unique and often dark fictional narrative with character studies that leaves you wondering if you have to read the whole book again as it is not only that good you are still ridden with a myriad of questions about each protagonist in the book she has successfully taken on america’s ongoing healthcare trauma in ‘so much for that’ obesity in ‘big brother’ and extreme school violence in ‘we need to talk about kevin’ the latter was turned into a movie with tilda swinton and the story leaves you wondering about the horrendous reservoirs of misery that the human mind can apparently sink to beyond depressing but a captivating read ‘the post birthday world’ on the other hand is far more upbeat and captures an extramarital affair in minute detail exploring two different outcomes if a kiss had or had not happened so my expectations for her latest tome ‘the mandibles’ were quite high and shriver does not disappoint on the contrary she has taken her social commentary to a new level altogetherit would be hard to describe the book and not give away its plot but in short it comes down to the greenback losing its value and the countries that have so generously advanced money to the debtaddicted american nation now seek repayment by other means  the world’s reserve currency is now the ‘bancor’ and america’s first latino president resorts to extreme measure to ensure that the nation’s debt can be repaid in order to avoid a looming war with among others china as we have seen in reallife with greece’s debt crisis the pain of drastic monetary action falls on the citizenry and so it falls on the mandible family whose journey we follow over a year period again what makes shriver’s writing so compelling is the plausibility of her fiction in many ways we have already and consciously started the downward journey to a world where the greenback is no longer valuable and where we have to find our way back to gold and other instruments like bitcoin that store and preserve valueit is not hard to imagine a world without currencies and cash and just imagine if we did away with it all would the physical world not look exactly as it is now a house is still a house with or without a mortgage contract right the mandibles is almost a piece of basic economic theory explaining how the artificial monetary construct on which we have built our society is vital in sustaining our physical world and pretty much all relations that govern our lives once money evaporates the world around us changes so much that our core foundations get uprooted to such an extent that everything around us falls apart and gets destroyed rip up a mortgage contract and your house will all of a sudden look very different that is what shriver’s book tells usso yes although fiction the book is a piece of socialpolitical commentary that resonates deep in the current environment something that shrives alludes too when referring to the  financial crisis in her book keynesian budgetary policies are demonstrated to have outlived their usefulness and a tech empowered welfare state that is used as an outsourcing center for the world’s new economic powerhouses china india stand out as examples of our near term economic prospects the crowning piece however is a libertarian nirvana that has seceded from the united states on close inspection however it is nothing less than a darwinian struggle for survival where the absence of government supported healthcare and rampant crime are the inescapable side effects for those that seek to claim one of the last remaining pieces of freedom on planet earth as dry and haunting as this may sound shriver brings this dark vision of our future to life with some phenomenal protagonists that span four generations the kids that are our current day millennials the postboomers boomers as well as the last representative of the greatest generation embodied by the mandible pater familias ‘great grand man’ whose fortune everyone is after are condemned to each other and to figuring out life without the hoped for family fortune as a consequence each family member has to fend for his or her own interests and shriver dives right into her knowledge of self as she describes the impact of the economic crisis on the generation that ultimately carries the most guilt in our monetary undoing the baby boomers obsessed by selfinterest health and eternal youth these are the ones that have to fight hardest to accommodate the most to the unforgiving postdollar world one of them nollie mandible is the boomer that is able to redeem herself and is in all likelihood shriver herself as she paints the way out of the disaster that has effectively destroyed the united states as we know it​it did not take me long to finish the book it was that riveting a read blending personal fictional drama with a fairly plausible analysis of the world’s future if we keep borrowing and printing money it is after all not that hard to fathom that at some point this century indonesia will invade australia yet it takes some dark futurology to invoke it in a novel as an entirely logical outcome of a reordered world shriver does that with both humor and substance and has put down a book that we all should read and reflect on while we still have our hands on the monetary steering wheel  comment building a startup ecosystem in the caribbean   comments   the region’s first angel investment conference aligns entrepreneurs and funders for a diversified regional economylast week i attended and presented at the caribbean angel investor forum in montego bay jamaica the first conference of its kind jointly organized by the caribbean export development agency and the world bank the goal was to put angel investing in the caribbean on the map and seek to professionalize the emergence of a new asset class which can be a key driver for economic growth and job creation it was hoped that it could also deal with debunking the stereotype of angel investing as some sort of game for the wealthy only  not only do many people invest at the angel level these days they do this in combination with offering mentoring startups and helping to build ecosystems that will support stronger and above all more diversified economiesa number of angel investors lawyers entrepreneurs and government officials from all over the caribbean as well as the us and canada exchanged ideas and above all sought to learn from each other the caribbean has not been immune to global shifts and the trinidad delegation pointed out that their economy could no longer take oil revenues for granted and that diversification of the economy through angel deals was a necessity for them while each country had its own issues it was key to bring them on all on the same page with regards to proper angel investing it was therefore good that at the opening tomi davies from nigeria laid down very clearly that early stage investing was primarily investing in people and building longterm relationships it was relatively easy for me to expand on that theme by explaining that i had seen wellfunded companies with great technologies fail while i had seen relatively lowertech companies with limited amounts of cash flourish simply because of the people involved  while in some caribbean countries the concept of angel investing has only just taken hold others are making solid progress and have raised the bar significantly in the latter category falls first angels jamaica which has built up a small portfolio of interesting investments but above all has developed a very disciplined investment approach at the same time they are lobbying for government and regulatory support which will benefit all jamaican investors and entrepreneurs its chairman joseph matalon opened and closed the conference and not only shared his experiences to date but pointed to the challenges in getting government support in that he elaborated on the fact that politicians are driven by election cycles and that building ecosystems where angels invest and nurture emerging companies takes much longer this is something we have seen in canada as well where the focus on natural resource projects somehow always outranks entrepreneurial activity during election cycles in any case jamaica’s minister of state for finance fayval williams was present to hear this message and took the opportunity to summarize the progress the island state has made and emphasizing the fertile ground it now is for entrepreneurial activity      it was timely that the naco common documents had just been launched so i could give some depth and materials to my workshops on deal structuring and due diligence and share some vital education with the caribbean community there was energy and a clear thirst for knowledge on how to negotiate financings how to create solid working relationships with entrepreneurs and equally important how to get angel investors to work together share deals pool funds and do due diligence together in an organized waythe best part of the conference for me were the entrepreneur sessions a number of regional startups pitched their ideas followed by ‘speeddating’ at a number of tables the impressive thing was not only the quality of the pitches – they would easily be very competitive in a north american setting – but the visionary and global approach each entrepreneur took they all understood that their market was pancaribbean and global and their plans and ambitions more than underlined that a much needed emergency platform an extremely energetic candy manufacturer a caribbean ubertype transportation play an inabm advertising deal that generated some interesting revenue streams and a platform for stroke and elderly patients brought the audience to action it was great to have dinner afterwards with a few of them one local entrepreneur had graduated from mit set up his mobile survey conversations startup in kenya and had now stopped at the conference on his way to silicon valley to talk about his series a financing global thinking in action indeedso there is no lack of ambition and willingness to finance and nurture an emerging angel and startup ecosystem in the caribbean and kudos to those that have taken the plunge in making it happen but there are some major hurdles too lack of capital is not one of them according to most of the participants although some time was spent on figuring out how to mobilize the caribbean diaspora to invest back home much like ethnic chinese have done when their country roared back to growth in recent decades lack of investable deals however was the key and most cited issue building deal flow not only requires patience it also is a matter of education mentoring and changing a mindset as is engaging with local universities and possibly enticing diaspora talent to come back and start companies add to that the common complaint that local entrepreneurs often lack the maturity to negotiate a deal and be mentored and it became very clear where the energies are to be focused a combination of education and trial and error will in the end yield results and this is exactly what matalon alluded to when he spoke about the time and effort involved in building successful startup ecosystemsthe key driver for this however in the end is success not until the first early stage deals grow become success stories and generate exits will the larger environment take notice and mobilize new entrepreneurial minds who have seen that it can be done while also unearthing new pools of capitalwhile each participant came away with different insights and ideas all of them were energized at the same time they were armed with a good sense of reality by understanding in what areas work needs to be done going forward the first caribbean angel investor forum was a wellorganized effort and a good start to get that process going keep your eyes open for the next emerging startup market  comments tech and term sheets   comments   creating a canadian standard for term sheets to get more and better deals done faster​over the past year and a half i have been conducting a workshop on term sheets and structuring deals across canada this is part of the national angel capital organization of canada’s naco effort to encourage angel investing and in particular help tech businesses get off the ground it has taken me to niagara kitchenerwaterloo calgary victoria my hometown vancouver kingston in jamaica and next week regina and saskatoon wherever i go there are keen and very diverse audiences willing to learn how to structure and do better deals having done this work for many years it is sometimes surprising to see how light the knowledge about this is on the ground and what difference an intense hour workshop can make not to mention getting people enthusiastic about participating in an asset class that was until recently the domain of a privileged few because yes people are writing cheques into highrisk ventures or into funds that are trying to get a return on supporting emerging tech firms across canada as i have learned the term sheet is the starting point of what sometimes can be a very long and rocky relationship so better get it right on day onein the process it has become clear that canadian startups often use outdated term sheets sometimes found after a google search or by simply copying american documents that are an awkward fit for local deals as a board member of an angel fund i see many founder generated term sheets and even when there are reputable advisors or directors involved the quality is generally poor i do not need to see a term sheet where one page is dedicated to director biographies these are not deal terms and documents like this go straight to the garbage can unless we find the company willing to renegotiate and rewrite the document in most case such a joint effort yields much better term sheets and at the same time we have enhanced the entrepreneurs’ understanding of the processso how great it was that boris mann – another vancouver tech veteran – and i got invited to project manage nacocommondocs a project designed to launch a canadian standard for common and preferred share deals as well as convertible loan and convertible equity the latter also known as safes or simply agreement for future equity as easy as it would have been for boris and me to lock ourselves in a room for a day and bang these new standards out they have to reflect the canadian market place and regional opinions and some deep legal thought from the six law firms that are sponsoring this important project not to mention accounting opinions so we have travelled to montreal toronto calgary victoria halifax and of course vancouver where lawyers angel investors and entrepreneurs commented on our work and at times ripped apart some of our assumptions and deeply held beliefs our egos believe me can take that there is nothing like solid and constructive feedback that seeks to improve your product  and yes there are regional differences in some parts of the country angels will insist on having the ‘redemption right’ in any term sheet whereas in vancouver and calgary the mere mentioning of this concept generated outright hostility try and synthesize those two points of view into one standard document​but as always in life the truth is somewhere in the middle and there are many ways is which we can bridge the discrepancies and still present a menu card from which to build a perfect term sheet for your startup both angel investors and founders can now use a base term sheet with options to extend with additional clauses that will better reflect their deal at the same time lawyers will no longer have to worry about wasting billable time on educating cash strapped company founders on what a term sheet really is they will be able to point to the naco website and say educate yourself negotiate a deal and we can help you with the rest  as we dove into this it became clearer that there are indeed many aspects depending on if you are doing a common share preferred share convertible loan or a convertible equity safe deal tax implications share options vesting schedules you name it it is all more than just sticking a clause in an agreement so in addition to the term sheets and accompanying educational notes we will present a number of onepagers on the naco portal when the project is launched april that will complement and enhance knowledge expect notes on tax credits friends  family rounds and the not unimportant one that answers the question which document to use when​but above all the key drive is to build better companies as canada’s economy is diversifying while at the same time being asked to compete in a razor sharp global environment last week’s bc tech summit in vancouver made me realize how far we have come over the past twenty years and how mature start ups have become even when often using crappy term sheets there is strong momentum with many ideas and readily available capital although we can do more to create better companies and mobilize more investment dollars the challenge will be for solid people to combine these ingredients and build a strong technology cluster that will – as much as angel investors like exits – stay in canada and build wealth right here   comments the dutch election   comment   the pioneer of modern day populism gets ready for a vote that may change very little being the first always takes some unusual bravery and unique character it was the dutch that started experimenting with right leaning movements that put immigration on the agenda in the late s and its initial champions were indeed hardly average citizens a flamboyant gay professor an errant moviemaker and a poor somali refugee turned politician were the pioneers in ending the small nation’s politically correct consensus model championing enlightenment values they warned of a society that would succumb to accommodating nonwestern values and eventually the erosion of individual rights the professor convincingly argued he was not prepared to fight the s battle for women and gay rights again the refugee and moviemaker teamed up to make a controversial short film about the submissive role of women in islam brave as they were within short order two of them were murdered and one was hounded out of the country to take up us residency pim fortuyn theo van gogh and ayaan hirsi ali had been able to create a foundation on which the dutch will now contest a much anticipated and divisive election that will tilt country further to the right fracture its parliament and decimate one of the dominant purveyors of that famed consensus the labour party that said it remains to be seen if the march election will bring the sort of change that some are now expectingalmost each and every piece written about the netherlands ever since fortuyn rose to international fame will wax on lyrically about dutch tolerance and its liberal attitudes the lax attitude to drugs in particular gives north americans something to drool about for some reason foreign commentators fail to understand and align their rosy view of the country with the realities that literally brought blood to its streets the perceptions are as mistaken as they are misinformed the dutch by nature are not more liberal than any other group history and culture have forged a nation that is at best extremely pragmatic and at worst pretty indifferent the political violence and drama are not a shattering of a liberal nirvana no they represent a logical reset as something was apparently not working anymore the pragmatic consensus had run its course a notion not fully understood around the globewhen its economy rose from the ashes in the post war world cheap labour from southern europe and notably turkey and morocco fuelled growth and created a lower class of nonintegrated citizens of whom the expectation was that they would pack up and go once they had reaped rewards from a dutch dream but nothing like that ever materialized – on the contrary family reunifications increased the size of this group dramatically – and a growing muslim minority became a feature of dutch life in a nation that stood silently by and in many cases actively collaborated in the deportation and murder of  of its jewish citizens the guilt of that weighed so heavily that any form of discrimination indeed any critical discussion of minorities became a total taboo the instinct was to make it work as best as possible and to rather not talk about it in an odd twist of fate it was the dutch contribution to the holocaust that ensured that instead of jews its new and sizeable minority was now muslimas the s unfolded and more refugees eastern europe africa came to take up dutch residency the european union added its weight by usurping the nation’s sovereignty its currency and with it its confident sense of self native dutch emigration against a backdrop of political discontent and an emerging economic crisis set the tone for the first decade of the new century if you can get out you might as well for a brief moment the belief that things would be fine emerged hopes of a ‘moderate muslim’ and successful integration patterns heralded some calm but not for long the brexit vote and migrant streams from the middle east boosted the fortunes of the new right and put pressure on mark rutte the current prime minister who is heading a reasonably successful liberallabour coalitionwith its three pioneers off the stage fortuyn  emerged in the form of geert wilders an erstwhile liberal politician who broke ranks with his party over turkey’s potential eu membership his words were harsher far more direct including a political rally in which the crowd shouted “less less” to wilders’ question if they preferred “less” or “more” moroccans he answered his audience that “we will take care of that” and it landed him in court which true to the populist instincts of his movement only boosted his popularity and poll rankings any attention is better than no attention and the nature of his campaign had become mainstream as his star continued to rise in the pollsanother thing the nation pioneered successfully was realitytv yes the wave of shows that enveloped the world originally started out with the ‘big brother’ series in the s launched in the netherlands exported globally the coarser and the more vulgar the language the more viewers and so it went with dutch politics where – much like donald trump – the race to the abyss was accelerated in order to get more media attention morality and decency be damned the voter not only stopped caring they had developed a veritable appetite for it all and leave it to the dutch to do one better only a few weeks ago it was treated to a real ‘golden shower’ video with a famous s  s singer allowing herself to be rained on by her lover yes by all means do the math on her ageso in this cacophony of noise political instability and eroding sense of nationality populist parties are thriving and if polls hold steady wilders’ freedom party has a decent shot at being the largest party with second place going to rutte’s freemarket liberals the very people who until now represented the real dutch right the left has fractured into a socialist workers party party for animals greenleft democrats  the remnants of labour and think a party representing immigrants to top it all off the party  is gaining traction in a nation where the greying top layer is increasingly worried about its entitlements although it has consistently refused to produce babies at the replacement rate in order to secure these benefits and at the same time no one is interested to have the required level of immigration to supplant these unborn babies call this hedonism at its best so in a bizarre way the fear of immigration contrasts itself with the need for immigration a fact none of the dutch parties left or right has so far really acknowledgeddutch consensus worked well historically as proportional representation forced the parties to collaborate sometimes tilting left sometimes tilting right but never any dramatic shift in either direction the pragmatic mandate brought nonideological common sense to governing the lowlands and that may indeed explain the nation’s social and economic successes in the postwar years the question now is if the current pressures on the system will force it to break or notif wilders wins big he will most likely not become prime minister as any coalition can lock him out of power a position he actually may prefer it is better to oppose and make the usual noise than to take real responsibility at the same time any coalition government will be weak by virtue of the number of parties now required to get support from a parliamentary majority so the best the dutch can hope for is a fragile consensus that may not be able to carry the load of issues it is being asked to deal withthe cracks that have started to emerge in dutch political system after fortuyn van gogh and hirsi ali may reach deeper after this election but it will not be an election to end it all more one to perpetuate it allupdate march  so the results are in the populist right under wilders gained but not nearly as much as was projected only a month ago the newer parties on the left green party for animals think did well too but not nearly well enough to change the game the two largest parties lost big labour was clobbered and the freemarket liberals lost but are still the largest party in parliament with  of the seats while the traditional christiandemocrats and independent liberals recovered some groundso the electorate gave a stern but mild warning to the traditional parties to get their act together the voters pulled both right and left but not hard enough the traditional centrist parties now have the unenviable task to agree to form a four party coalition that will need to steer the small nation through the stormy waters it is in a mild repudiation of the ‘ruling elites’ has given these very elites the task to try it once more but they will have to take into account that that there is some unhappiness that will need to be addressedan outcome where no one wins is probably the best definition of a compromise the dutch are good at that and in the end may not be a bad thing at all  comment bannon and thiel   comment   will creative destruction be america’s future one of my good friends here is a true old style american liberal crossed the border into canada as a result of his disgust over vietnam in the sixties became a professor and now an angel investor and avid student of history but a liberal above all we get together often to talk business and politics so not long after the election of trump i reached out preparing myself for a somewhat emotional lecture of how devastated he was about it all yet his reaction was as calm and measured as it was baffling to me ‘no’ he said in a resigned manner ‘this was bound to happen if something is not working americans will try the next best option and it is as simple as that’ ‘but’ he added ‘progressivism as we know it is dead in america that’s for sure’ no anger no frustration just a simple statement underlining how americans pragmatically tweak and change things as they see fitit was a sobering but above all realistic call of what had just transpired his words lingered in the air in the subsequent weeks as i tried to unwind the new balance of power figuring out how things would be managed from washington going forward the name that kept popping up was that of steve bannon ceo of breitbart media and trump’s campaign manager having met andrew breitbart many years ago when he was only known as ‘drudge’s westcoast guy’ i was quite familiar with the brand and the general political direction of the media outlet bannon invested in and now managed it has to be said though that when breitbart passed away there was praise for him from all sides of the political spectrum a sentiment that was hard to find now that his successor was ensconced in the white house but what was bannon really about what were his objectives the superficial slurs of ‘white supremacist’ seemed too banal and uninformed there had to be some deeper grounds on which bannon made his career as an activist and that landed him only steps away from the presidencyonce i had digested some readily available articles about him most quite overlapping in terms of information i watched ‘generation zero’ a documentary bannon released in  and which supposedly lays out his vision for america it is a somewhat dark and haunting epic centered around the financial crisis of  its origins and its key perpetrators at least according to bannon the baby boomer generation to put it in simple terms he sees four turning points in american history each an economic crisis that mutates into an all out war that unites the nation and in turn resets american life to a new start the american revolution the civil war and the second world war were the first three the recent financial crisis of  is a prelude to the fourth turning point that – as it happens – we are now entering into the movie itself does not point to the imminent war but based on bannon’s comments it is likely an everexpanding conflict with radical islam or could it be chinathese are of course entirely plausible theories of history and bannon fills the documentary with evidence of it all but noticeably points to the liberal baby boomer generation – of which he is a part – as the inadvertent architects of the fourth turn the economic argument he puts forward could equally have been made by bernie sanders government bails out wall street and the average citizen foots the bill a bill that is now so high that we are passing on an amount of debt that will likely crush and frustrate the next generation’s prospects of having a chance at a life that would resemble that of previous generations bannon takes the gloomier road and points to the baby boomer’s hedonism and selfindulgence as the dark force that has wrecked america for many decades to come in it he makes no distinction between the three boomer leaders that presided over the steady rot that has infected the system clinton bush and obama elitism trumps ideologythroughout trump’s campaign there was a call to go back to the s a time when ‘america was great’ productive and growing i have seen similar nostalgic calls for that period in my native netherlands when the late pim fortuyn took the stage as rightofcentre populist when the postwar years were heralded as a model to aspire to no one has ever made clear why my father always said the fifties were an incredibly and forgettable boring period but bannon succeeds in explaining the why no one he argues after having gone through the great depression and world war ii was interested in anything but a ‘white picket fences’ happy suburbia where everyone worked played and was content this also explains why we can no longer replicate this utopia none of us have gone through a real depression and devastating war so none of the baby boomer or millennial generations can actually value much less aspire to that what is so special about this suburban dreamland if anything it has made most people deeply unhappy and often in search of a ‘meaning of life’ quest if bannon’s views come to fruition there will be plenty of meaning to be found in merely surviving and fighting whoever takes on what is left of the western world as i said gloom and a prelude to a civilizational war is what ‘generation zero’ is all aboutbannon seeks the creative destruction of this deformed society that we now live in a society where risk taking the core american value has been taken away either directly or by government guarantee in that he parts ways with sanders who would use the state as a force of good bannon wants to tear the state apartthe carmaker bailout is a great example and that brings us to that other creative destructionist supporting trump silicon valley entrepreneur peter thiel few understood how a gay tech entrepreneur could back up trump based on what we know about him is that he saw in trump exactly the same thing bannon noticed the agent that could bring about a radical reset of how we run the economy how we manage america as a socalled ‘technolibertarian’ thiel would no doubt have rejected the now infamous auto industry bailout not only because of its poor economics which would have been bannon’s point but also for the fact that ‘the car’ was already being reengineered by different companies in a different place why bailout ‘big auto’ when google is already on its way building tomorrow’s car thiel believes strongly that america lost its way because it stopped innovating at the pace it once did and only a radical overhaul of existing industries can open the way to a new america herein lies of course a conflict with the new president whose promise to ‘bring back’ manufacturing jobs contrasts sharply with the idea of ‘reinventing’ manufacturing jobs if he is to take thiel’s – and bannon’s advice  – the actual destruction of old industries would set the stage for very different jobsso bannon and thiel unleashed a quest for a new america and settled – for the time being – on trump to bring in that agenda and while the entire world is fretting over immigration and the president’s daily tweets the far more powerful move into the future is beginning to shape up it is one that is inspired by both bannon and thiel and will very likely end or reform liberal society to a point that we find it hard to recognize it quite possibly unleashing an unregulated and extreme form of freemarket enterprise because that is what america is best at and reversing laws like frankdodd will unleash another wall street bonanza this time however there will not be a government to bail out the losersthe deeper question is if bannon and thiel will be able to influence trump to bring about their vision for a renewed america and what geopolitical gambles will be part of that package west wing access is a fluid thing even for these two in case their tenure or trump’s comes to an end the question will be who will work with what has been put in place because as my good liberal friend alluded to it is unlikely that we will ever be turning back the early stage of the bannonthiel fueled revolution is an answer to the wave of irreversible technological global and fiscal realities we will all have to deal and work with it  comment so long chase hotel   comments   saying goodbye is never easy and this week i felt some real sadness upon learning that the chase hotel in palm springs had been sold to a group of developers  during our early years here in canada we spent no less than three christmas holidays in one of the nicest family hotels i have ever visited and here’s the storyit was a chance encounter for sure irene and i had spent weeks googling for a nice place to stay over christmas in the desert resort knowing that with two very young kids we needed access to a lot of things and ideally a kitchen so somehow we hit the chase during our online search and booked two adjoining rooms with kitchen in the heart of the old city of palm springs better known as the ‘movie colony’  it was an older motel  famously frequented by doris day in the s  small and nicely renovated with a decent pool and sizeable like huge rooms  we felt at home right away in no small part because of the owner craig blau and his super friendly staff  a retired fisherman from oregon he and his wife had started looking for a home in palm springs but ended up buying a hotel by his own admission he had absolutely no knowledge of the hospitality business and that is probably exactly what made him such a great host he ran the place as if it was his own home and treated each and every guest with the same open friendly attitude that you would extend to any houseguest i did not get the impression craig wanted to lose money on his hotel venture but making the hotel hugely profitable was never of paramount importance or so it seemed the hotel oozed calm friendliness and warmth much like the desert surrounding ita simple selfserve breakfast of fruit juice and muffins enabling our kids to walk down and have breakfast on their own if they wanted oranges and grapefruits right from the poolside trees and late afternoon chocolate chip cookies were the signature treats at the chase and then the guests a stable crowd as they kept coming back yearafteryear we made some good friends there and even a potential business deal emerged with a couple from newport beach who were devoted chase frequenters the kitchen in the room enabled us to make some great meals – our induction to the world of trader joe’s hails from the chase days – and the bbq at poolside was often used while we sipped away at quality cabernets that in canada are too expensive too buy  and although we only brought kids guests were allowed to bring their dogs and craig would politely but firmly dismiss any potential guests that did not like dogs if people wanted to bring their pets finecentrally located it was only a stroll to palm springs’ main drag south palm canyon drive with its shops and sonny bono statue yes you could feel some of the old hollywood influence and craig was always keen to venture some background stories like how our favourite mexican restaurant around the corner was frequented by suzanne somers who rumor had it would never tip the waiters and then there was the palm springs art museum just a few blocks away and the short drive to the indian canyons for some desert hiking people always ask me what you can do in palm springs beside golfing and sitting next to the pool but there is so much there one could spend months exploring and living the desert life the chase somehow opened that door for usthe pressure of development was always there and more than once the owners got offers or threats from neighboring developers to move the chase somewhere else  i remember craig telling me that he had some issues with a neighboring property owner who threatened to sue him as it was his “american right to develop anything he liked” next to craig’s hotel craig remained unfazed and commented it was his american right to oppose that in any way he could  it highlighted his total calm and care to keep the chase the way it was simple clean friendly and above all unpretentious the only thing that would really excite him was politics and i recall how he was embarrassed about bush jr and the iraq war and it makes me wonder what craig is thinking right now that we have landed in the age of trump​as time moved on our christmas holidays changed in  taking craig’s own strong advice to go to arizona as its desert was so much nicer than the one that surrounds palm springs life moves on and we lost touch with the chase with craig now well into his seventies it is going to be redeveloped and the fear is smaller rooms with your prefab minikitchenette because the new owners want you to eat in their new restaurant of course what’s worse the hotel will lose its name and revert to its s name holiday house hotel i remember sitting in the patio with craig one day and asking him why they called the hotel ‘chase’ he looked at me with a grin and pointed at his dog and said ‘we couldn’t come up with anything so we just named it after the dog’ and that was precisely how the hotel was warm fun with an ability to take life not all that seriously the chase hotel its owners and staff will be deeply missed christmas  nora and maeve in their pajamas in the hotels reception area with craig on the right and the dog that gave the hotel its signature name forgot the name of the guy on the left entrance to the chase on west arenas road  comments education update   comments   so i finally had some time to put down my thoughts on british columbias convoluted public education system with some ideas as to how we can fix it you can find it here  comments angel investing in jamaica﻿   comments   over the past year i have been conducting a workshop on structuring early stage deals and term sheets as part of the naco academy now this will take me to such places as calgary and kitchener to name a few so imagine my pleasant surprise when i was invited to conduct the workshop in kingston jamaica the local angel investing group firstangels jamaica had organized a twoday event where they would present one of their latest deals have their members network and allow me to run two modules one a general introduction to angel investing and a second one focused on term sheetslike any other small nation jamaica is forced by history and circumstances to look outward and be creative in developing its economic potential and for good measure this goes well beyond reggae tourism and having great athletes booking olympic successes jamaica consequently is a nation of entrepreneurs and in that they are supported by a wellconnected jamaican diaspora that is able to source capital and deals that spur entrepreneurial activity on the island nation of some three million people in addition it is also one of the key hubs for caribbean economic development so it was great to discuss the deals firstangels had recently done and understand how local universities on the island plugged into this development what emerged was a country with a real zest to develop new business sectors ideas ready to be funded and incubated by a steadily growing class of private investors keen to diversify their holdings and help fund local growth when asked what the biggest constraint was on growing this community the answer was as i had expected deal flow so far firstangels has funded four deals and they are keen to find more within their geographic setting it should be noted that angel investors generally prefer to invest close to home during the actual workshops and panel discussion it was interesting to see the parallels and differences with other angel networks in north america there were lots of questions from the audience that consisted of both aspiring investors entrepreneurs and various professionals a lot of time and questions dealt with valuation and i did my best to dissuade the attendees from getting too hung up over these and encouraged them to focus on the bigger picture and map out the future financing milestones of a new venture first it was also rewarding to dive deeper into concepts that weren’t fully incorporated into local deal structuring and i happily elaborated on founder vesting and structuring option plans it was great to have some jamaican lawyers on the panel and get them to share some of their experiences but above all it was great to meet the entrepreneurs and learn how they got their businesses off the ground with limited resources firstangels presented their most recent deal an investment in bookfusion and the ebook company is not any different from us or canadian startups having cleverly outsourced some development to europe combined with a us presence this jamaican company is on to the next step with the support of the local angel community their story merged perfectly into my framework for the workshop and enabled all the participants to learn more about starting and financing companies and above all feel energized to take the next steps in that process as for me i really enjoyed the extremely friendly and positive jamaican atmosphere and once more realized how the rapid movement of capital and ideas is fuelling a new breed of economic activity across borders note anyone interested in getting me to do the twohour introduction to angel investing or the fourhour structuring deals and term sheet workshops should contact melissa dodaro at naco for further details  comments ariel sharon and deng xiaoping   comments   some lessons for life and political success staying at it it is surprising to some extent to see how the world these days devours ‘selfhelp’ and or ‘career advisory’ books all promising to deliver the right tools and techniques to bring us riches and happiness or some sort of combination thereof it was a relief for me this summer to return to my old passion of reading political biographies and to realize that all the clues to happier lives and better careers can easily be found by studying the lives of some of history’s great and see how they navigated some of the deeper challenges that defined their lives and come out as winners so this summer i dove into david landau’s epic work on the life of ariel sharon and it was followed by the deeply researched and voluminous biography that ezra vogel put together on deng xiaoping as a historical figure sharon tends to generate some negative reactions given the abrasive style he was known for his presumed guilt in the sabra and shatila massacres and triggering the second intifada following his visit to the temple mount in  both of these claims by the way are clearly and helpfully dispelled by landau’s book deng however usually can count on a far more sympathetic treatment as the man that transformed and modernized china this of course is somewhat questionable as deng most probably had been far more directly involved in unleashing lethal force on his own subjects no less during his career as one of chairman mao’s key enforcers and eventually as china’s paramount leader during my years in asia it was not unknown to hear business leaders praise the bloody crackdown in tiananmen as one of the essential building blocks of a stable china that is open for business  whatever the merit of that morally flawed argument both deng and sharon built their careers in newly formed nations – israel being established in  and the people’s republic of china only one year later  – that were under such formative pressures that the internal and external use of force were essential parts of the job although china and israel came into being under vastly different circumstances and cannot be compared in terms of size and histories the parallels between the careers of both men are striking  both biographies clearly present that their entire lives were essentially in the service of their nation and that both consequently took a deep personal toll in the process these were compounded by significant personal dramas landau’s description of the death of sharon’s young son gur is moving and heartbreaking much the same can be said for the way deng’s son pufang was denied medical treatment during the cultural revolution a result of which he spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair paralyzed from the waist down it is a testament to the quality of the books that you can sense how the deep pain of these personal tragedies accompanied these two men for the rest of their political lives and how it motivated them yet the essence of both careers was that it took a lifetime to get to the top positions deng being a solid seventyfour when he could truly claim to be china’s paramount leader sharon was seventythree on the day he was inaugurated as israel’s primeminister both books give a very detailed accounting for the reasons it took so long and how both men persisted against the many different forces that were aligned against them the pragmatic fixer deng had the nearly insurmountable task to carve out a space for plain reason and common sense progress in the toxic environment created by mao’s continuous political struggles where dogma trumped everything else deng was purged from the leadership twice in  and within about a year of returning from the first one in  both of these had career ending potential yet deng not only overcame both events he emerged stronger and far more decisive sharon in turn had to navigate a different but equally explosive political environment in israel – landau’s book is a key primer to get a feel for the machinations of israeli political powerplay – but also his own character which at times created some roadblocks on avenues that had opened up for him the benefit of the long road that both had to travel was of course the accumulation of deep experience and a huge personal network of politicians administrators and military commanders complemented by an incredibly clear and growing sense of direction for each nation this of course was compounded by the fact that by the time they reached the highest office there was little time left for them given their advanced age for deng it meant rejecting orthodox communism and embracing capitalism while maintaining oneparty rule for sharon it was ditching the nationalist settler movement that propelled him to power and embrace disengagement from the palestinian enemy once you come to the end of sharon’s biography it is both harsh and painful to see how he in early  succumbed to a hemorrhagic stroke that sent him into an eightyear coma from which he never woke up  the remaining question that even the masterful landau can not answer is whether sharon would following the departure from gaza in  have continued his unilateral disengagement by withdrawing from the west bank and setting the stage for more favorable conditions for israelipalestinian peace than is the case now what we do know is that had sharon lived as long as deng he would no doubt have left an even deeper imprint on the middle east deng retired from the political scene in  having reached the tender age of eightyeight and as opposed to sharon did live to see most of what he set out to do a stable and steadily growing china so what do these old men of state and their biographers have to tell us about our lives and careers the same lessons that drove deng and sharon to ultimate success in their lives and careers hard work focus family and never ever giving up   note  deng xiapong and the transformation of china by ezra f vogel  and arik the life of ariel sharon by david landau  as a complement i would recommend reading the cultural revolution a peoples history  by frank dikötter  which gives a bit more depth and analysis of the horrors of the cultural revolution an area on which vogel’s book was a bit light  comments previous about this is my weblog and as opposed to the earlier one i ran years ago this is not one about just politics and markets this is about everything i fancy from time to time simply because i need to write and comment  archives june  may  march
