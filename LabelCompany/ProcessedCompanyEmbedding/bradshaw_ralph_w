university school of medicine st louis mo  senior fellow and acting research assistant professor department of biochemistry university of washington seattle wa  research associate department of chemistry indiana university bloomington in research interests my overall research interests are related to the structurefunction relationships of proteins for many years these have focused on two areas eukaryotic signal transduction and coposttranslational processing of protein ntermini we are presently using proteomicbioinformatic approaches to study both areas primarily through the use of mass spectrometry an important segment of cell signaling is dependent on polypeptide growth factors and their receptors our recent studies have focused primarily on the trka receptor and the downstream phosphorylations that it induces utilizing stably transfected chimeric receptors with the ectodomain of the pdgf receptor and the transmembrane and endodomain of the trka receptor to define signaling responses we have quantitatively determined the shifts both positive and negative in the phosphoproteome induced after  min of stimulation in pc cells these modifications primarily involve serine and threonine residues tyrosine modifications generally occur at much shorter time points of stimulation by comparison to other analyses with the egf receptor in human cells at the same time interval following activation there was a dramatic similarity in response as judged by the responses of various kinase classes determined by substrate motifs we have also used the same paradigm to study the effects of mutating known tyrosine docking sites y and y on this profile these analyses revealed that there are additional signaling regionsdocking sites on the trka endodomain that are not subject to activation by the phosphoryaltion of y or y we are now expanding these studies to determine the profile of lysεacetylation and oglcnac modification of serine and threonine residues as an overlay study to the phosphoproteomic analysis the techniques utilized in these studies will also be useful in other applications such as determining the basis of drug resistance in cancer and in the differentiation of stem cells in addition in collaboration with the shokat laboratory we have also been addressing the immediate substrates of the trka kinase domain utilizing mutants that can utilize special atp derivatives and bearing the same signaling alterations the earliest modifications of proteins following the initiation of protein synthesis are nterminal modifications that can be divided into three main groups those that modify the αamino group those that modify the side chain of the nterminal residue and those that involve proteolysis of one or more amino acids there are more than three dozen such alterations some of which are quite common and are essentially ubiquitous and others that are quite rare similarly some occur as cotranslational events while others take place only later in the lifetime of the protein after it is fully synthesized we have focused on the removal of initiator methionine residues and the acetylation of the nαamino group with or without the methionine defects in these modifications have been increasingly tied to various pathologies and form the basis for further investigations select publications biarc j chalkley rj burlingame al

growth  income reckoning with questionable shareholders  boulder growth  income fund inc nysebif  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»boulder growth  income reckoning with questionable shareholdersnov  about boulder growth bif james ladue the boulder growth  income fund nysebif recently received two unsolicited shareholder proposals to elect alternative directors to the funds board of directors terminate its investment coadvisory contracts and continue an aggressive levelrate distribution policy ralph w bradshaw and ronald g olin the aforementioned shareholders suspiciously have a history of simultaneously submitting such requests an issue boulder plans to bring to the attention of the sec these similar proposals submitted by ralph w bradshaw and ronald g olin to other closedend funds were conducted in concert with the affiliated doliver capital adviser institutional manager whose hold currently stands at approximately  of the funds shares this association boulder also finds questionable considering the affiliated group has neglected to meet federal securities laws in filing their status as such moreover the group proposed the termination of the investment coadvisory contract between the fund and boulder investment advisers and stewart investment advisers the boulder advisers with this it is anticipated the group would have proposed cornerstone advisors as the replacement adviser based on past behavior to this fund president steve miller commented its hard to imagine that someone with cornerstones track record would have the audacity to suggest that the boulder advisers with their track record be replaced maybe they should take care of the cooking in their own kitchen before they recommend a new chef in ours reiterating his position miller disclosed … the trailing oneyear period ending  crfs total return on nav was  and clms was  this compares to bifs return on nav for the same period of  crfs market price has suffered even more falling from a lofty  premium in july  to about a  premium as of last friday and clm was at a  premium in may  and as of friday was at a discount of  as far as the group’s proposal for an aggressive levelrate distribution policy the board perceived this as overlooking the many factors not taken into consideration these factors include implementing and maintaining a levelrate distribution policy including the funds previously stated goal of tying its distribution rate to its longterm performance compliance with certain federal securities laws on maintaining the levelrate distribution policy the impact of an aggressive policy on the funds leverage coverage ratio the policys current and longterm efficacy in narrowing the funds discount from net asset value the tax consequences of levelrate distributions and the longterm investment interests of all of the funds shareholders miller continued the fund intends to pursue very aggressively its claims that this group and their investors are acting in violation of federal securities laws including referring this matter to the sec we are concerned that given their past tactics and their poor stewardship of the cornerstone funds their proposals would destroy value and not serve the longterm interests of our shareholders any proposal such as theirs to destroy the longterm value of one of the betterperforming closedend equity funds must be viewed with great skepticism we believe that the shareholder group led by messrs olin and bradshaw including doliver is known in the closedend fund industry as a group who acts in concert to gain control over closedend funds with little regard for federal securities laws this group tries to take action with respect to its own interests to profit at the expense of the interests of longterm shareholders this group may posture itself to be an advocate for shareholder rights but we believe that it acts only for its investors personal profit irrespective of whether their proposed actions are detrimental to longterm shareholders who have invested in the fund they have targeted the wrong fund additionally boulder plans to refer the group’s excess holdings to the sec for review and other independent remedies against the group for possible violations of federal securities laws the fund is a closedend management investment company comanaged by stewart investment advisers and boulder
