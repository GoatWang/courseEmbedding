alan d wilson has been charged with steering the company through difficult economic times and periods of extreme volatility in commodities prices founded in  and based near baltimore mccormick recently reported  fourth quarter sales of  million a  increase over the previous year but the company also noted that hikes in the cost of products such as dehydrated garlic black pepper and cinnamon spurred a  uptick in the prices of spices mccormick sells to restaurants supermarkets and other retailers it is likely that the increase will result in higher prices for consumers buying from the grocery shelf wilson joined mccormick in  and served in several managerial roles before becoming chairman and ceo in  prior to joining the company he worked at procter  gamble for nine years in a recent conversation with knowledgewharton wilson discussed the economy’s impact on the company mccormick’s efforts to expand internationally why the increased popularity of food network and celebrity chefs has been a boon and the company’s aim to create a relationship with customers by playing up “the romance of spice” an edited transcript of the conversation follows    knowledgewharton could you talk a little bit about how closely tied your business is to ups and downs in the commodities market alan d wilson practically everything we sell is subject to agricultural commodity changes… we have a wide variety of things that we are dealing with — everything from pepper to anise basil and turmeric — and they are grown all over the world competition for agricultural space is creating that surge in commodities… a lot of our industrial business — where we are selling products to other food manufacturers or to quickservice restaurants — is subject to things like the price of flour and soy bean oil which really are surging right now knowledgewharton mccormick recently raised the prices of the products it sells to grocery stores and to restaurants and warned that customers might see price increases as a result what are the challenges of getting consumer buyin for that especially when customers have become used to paying the same price for years — or may not have purchased a particular spice for several years when the cost was lower wilson well part of the challenge is the long purchase cycles of individual products consumers come to our section five or six times a year but they are buying something different almost every time they come there is not a lot of consciousness in terms of what you paid last time but there is a comparison between our products and competitors’ products in our case private labels store brands are our largest competitor we have to make sure that we are responsible in pricing our brand carries a premium and consumers are willing to pay a certain premium for the promise the taste the freshness and the flavor that we deliver but we have to be very cautious about not letting those price gaps get too large knowledgewharton on the face of it your product is pretty basic spices are spices — or at least a lot of customers might think that how do you encourage innovation within that space wilson the key thing we are doing is looking at food trends and making those food trends accessible to the home consumer in our institutional business where we are selling to restaurants we do a lot creatively using chefs and food technologists to create new trends — then we are always out front we have something called the “flavor forecast” which we release a couple times a year looking forward a couple of years at what the new hot trends are going to be a few years ago we identified chipotle pepper as a food trend now you can get a chipotle dressing on a sandwich at subway or mcdonald’s so it has kind of hit the mainstream what we do is identify those trends and bring those to consumer products for example chefs are using things like smoked paprika or roasted spices and we have introduced a line of roasted gourmet spices and we also sell smoked paprika so we stay in front of that the other thing we do is convenience we have a new line called recipe inspirations which includes all of the spices that you need to make a specific recipe in one package and we sell those for under two dollars so it is very easy for the consumer to learn a new recipe and it is very convenient because everything is in one package knowledgewharton that would also seem to touch on the idea that a consumer might not want to buy a full bottle of a spice like coriander that he or she may never use again after making a specific recipe but if you buy it in a packet it’s just for that recipe wilson it is one use that’s right and if you like the recipe you can go buy the bottle knowledgewharton what kind of food trends do you think we can expect to see in the near future wilson what we are seeing is a real trend toward fusion kinds of flavors so a mixture of sweet and hot — for example mixing a cayenne pepper with a tart cherry kind of flavor is something that is really on trend international foods are continuing to find their way into everyday cuisine so what used to be more infrequent and exotic is now becoming part of our regular repertoire we have a brand called thai kitchen that was born out of identifying the fact that there are a tremendous amount of thai restaurants but most american consumers don’t know how to make thai food from scratch we provide the authentic ingredients and easy ways of getting to the things that you experience in a restaurant knowledgewharton i understand that mccormick is trying to expand its presence internationally what are the most important growth markets for you how do tastes in those markets differ from the tastes of us customers and how do you adjust to that wilson about  of our sales today are outside the united states we see the opportunity and the need to bring the kinds of things that we do to global consumers currently our largest markets outside the us are in western europe but we see a lot of growth in china and india india is one that is very exciting to us because spices are such a big part of the culture the average indian consumer consumes about four times the number — the poundage — of spices in a year that the average american consumer does india is a huge opportunity but right now it is not an organized market a lot of the spices are bought in bulk on the street as you need them… as people move up the economic chain there is a need for reliable brands and consistent products that are safe for those kinds of consumers… knowledgewharton high school we have a really good business in parts of latin america but in big parts of latin america we don’t have a presence other than joint ventures or licensees we don’t have the presence that i think we can have eastern europe is also an open territory for us we are continuing to work on expanding our presence in africa… we think there is a lot of growth from geographic expansion as we look around the world knowledgewharton how much research and preparation goes into figuring out how to sell your product in a new market how closely do you have to look at the population’s tastes and habits and how does that translate into the way you push the product wilson the most critical thing that we have to figure out for our success is how people cook and then how to make our products accessible to them in china for instance we are certainly selling spices and herbs in grocery stores and in food service outlets but consumers cook differently there the spice market in china is much much smaller than you would expect because consumers are cooking with things like chicken powders and bouillons and those sorts of things because of that our product line is a little different in china we are selling certainly spices and herbs but we also are selling some western products like ketchup salad dressings and jams but we are also selling chicken powders and chicken bouillons that are in line with the way people cook there we have to keep adapting to what people do in their local market knowledgewharton i had the chance look at your website this week there is a lot of information there including recipes tips and articles about the origins of different spices how important is that to your overall marketing how does it play a role in efforts to drive sales at the point of purchase wilson the biggest thing we can do to help grow our sales is to help consumers find new recipes and add a recipe to their weekly repertoire if they are doing that then they are going to continue to buy our products because we are helping to make that easy the biggest reason people come to our website is for recipes and we keep refreshing those the second piece of it is creating that emotional attachment that every brand has to have with a consumer a lot of what we do around the origins of different spices and creating the whole romance of spice is how we tell our story mccormick has been doing this for over  years we have people traveling to all the places that spices are grown and there is a tremendous amount of romance attached to the origins how things are processed and the really unique flavors that you can generate we want to make sure that we are bringing that kind of appeal to consumers knowledgewharton do you find that customers tend to gravitate toward the spices they know are customers gunshy about trying something that sounds more exotic how do you bridge that gap wilson things like the food network the cooking channel and celebrity chefs have people experimenting more and that is actually driving a surge we have seen spice consumption in the us go up substantially over the last several years as people get addicted to things like the food network that is a huge benefit for our business and we are making it easy for consumers as they try to find new things there certainly are consumers that are looking for everyday consistency we want to make that easy too for some consumers if it’s tuesday it is taco night so we have a taco seasoning mix that is familiar that kids love and that is really easy to use in new orleans there is one night of the week that is red beans and rice night we produce that product and sell a lot of that in the new orleans area specifically for those kinds of events where people are looking for familiarity knowledgewharton can you tell me a little more about what is involved in sourcing different spices what kind of processes are taking place before the products end up on store shelves wilson because we are the largest company in the category we have made an investment in teams of people who travel to the farms and the collectors and the local regions where the spices are sourced we’re doing a couple of different things one we are working with farmers for sustainable agriculture we are helping them with growing conditions obtaining the right kinds of seeds and how they handle product so that we get product that is consistent and safe that way we have to do less to treat the product when we bring it in to make it safe for consumers a second part of that mission is to be on the ground at different parts of the growing cycle so that we see what the yields are going to look like we can do some economic planning around what the prices are going to be and the supply part of the supplydemand curve so that we are anticipating and making decisions on whether we are taking long positions because crops may be short or more expensive or shorter positions because it is a really abundant crop and we know that prices are going to change we have teams traveling to all parts of the world at multiple times during the growing cycle so we really get an assessment we are sourcing products in different countries because their harvest cycles are at different times for example vietnam has a different harvest cycle for pepper than brazil than india or than indonesia we are really looking at that to see what the optimum timing and the right yields are for all those products knowledgewharton does that mean at different times of the year if i am buying black pepper for example it could be coming from a variety of different countries depending on when i buy it wilson we create a blend of different origins — and black pepper is a really good example — that gives you a consistent flavor every time you buy it now we do have in our gourmet lines very specific origins so if you are buying malabar pepper it is coming from one specific region but we do certainly blend everything to make it consistent it is just that the way we bring it in and the way the crop cycles come in knowledgewharton so if containers of pepper were entirely sourced from vietnam or from india the two would taste different thus you blend the different varieties together wilson to create a consistent flavor knowledgewharton that’s interesting how important does social responsibility become when you are working with so many different growers and different suppliers all over the world wilson it is a big part of our heritage we have always been a very responsible communitybased organization it also serves our economic interests to make sure that we have sustainable sources of the products that we are buying because we are dealing around the world with hundreds of thousands of individual farmers as we are able to help in creating that sustainable agriculture it helps our business be sustainable — economically sustainable as well as viable we found ways of helping so that the farmers and the collectors really want to deal with us we have done things like building schools and medical clinics in places like indonesia we built a medical clinic — two medical clinics — two years ago when there was an earthquake in indonesia those clinics survived and they really became a part of helping the community knowledgewharton what is your biggest challenge as a leader what do you enjoy most about your job conversely what keeps you up at night wilson i am in my fourth year as ceo and we have had a lot of volatility with the financial markets we have seen two upanddown cycles in commodities in that period and there is still a lot of uncertainty we are dealing in most developed markets still with pretty high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence at a time when commodity prices — in not just our products but oil prices and almost anything that people are buying in terms of food — are going up there is just an awful lot of volatility with that i have to make sure that our strategies and our business processes are adaptable to pretty rapid changes in the external environment we are continually working on how we can move faster to adapt our plans to what has happened in the external market as a leader the most important thing that i do is make sure that we have the right people in place working on the right things that’s where i spend a tremendous amount of my time — making sure that we have got good succession that we have people that have the skills that they need that are motivated and rewarded the right way that are based on building our business from the business strategy standpoint i spend a lot of time telling our story to consumers with customers and with investors so that we continue to get the kind of support and deliver the kind of results that we have delivered in the past knowledgewharton what is your favorite part of your job what do you enjoy most wilson i love the aspects of being out and being with teams i spend a lot of time in our culinary centers tasting the great food that we are preparing i love walking through and visiting our plants and facilities around the world seeing the passion that people bring to their jobs every day and talking to them about where the company is going… i get to go to some really cool places and eat some great meals that’s a great part of the job knowledgewharton mccormick was founded and originally based in baltimore but later moved its headquarters to the suburbs i understand that at one point the company launched a campaign to let customers know that if they still had spices in their kitchen with a baltimore address on the back of the package that those products were at least  years old and needed to be thrown out wilson and now they are  years old knowledgewharton and now they are  years old can you tell me a little more about that consumer education component of your business did you hear stories from people who had had the same bottle of basil in their kitchen for  years wilson oh absolutely part of that campaign was based on the fact that people don’t really manage their pantries when they have spices it is something that a lot of consumers perceive last forever while they will still be safe you lose the flavor aspects of it the reason you are putting things like sage in your turkey or your turkey gravy for example is to get that flavor impact that campaign was just an education campaign recognizing that people tend not to replenish things in their pantry very often when i talk to consumers i will ask “what would you serve your family that is five years old what food product” and the answer is “nothing” but they will keep spices for a long time because they tend to have — some of them especially — lower useup rates you have to keep thinking about it before i came to mccormick i had gotten a spice rack as a wedding present i had been married about  years when i came to the company and when i joined the company i got a new spice rack i started looking at the old one and realized that i had a lot of this stuff for  years it is an education campaign for consumers to keep replenishing and refining the obvious question is how long do spices last the answer is that it depends on how you store them but whole spices until they are ground have a very long shelf life — several years but once they are ground and if they are stored in the light you need to replace them every  to  months knowledgewharton i understand that you are kind of a foodie what is your favorite thing to cook and what is your favorite thing to eat wilson i am a grilling master… i grill yearround — i create a little path through the snow between my back door and my grill so i can grill even when there is a lot of snow on the ground… i love to do everything from salmon or other fish to steaks and venison and the kinds of things that really go great on the grill my favorite thing probably to eat is fish i eat a lot of different kinds of fish as i travel around and generally whatever is fresh there are lots of ways to cook fish whether it is with core spices or some marinades that create the flavor when i am out i tend to order a lot of fish knowledgewharton when you’re at the grocery store are you ever tempted to give customers advice in the spice aisle   wilson i do i absolutely do wherever i go i go to stores sometimes you will see consumers standing in front of the spice display and looking for something specific and i will help them find it… i will say “try this” or “i see you have some fresh melon try this chilean lime on melon — that is really good”   knowledgewharton do you tell them that you are the mccormick ceo and what is their reaction wilson usually no but i do sometimes go and talk to the grocery clerk who is managing the spice set because i want to find out what is working well what is not working well and they are very aggressive about telling me whether we are getting good service or not and what is moving and what’s not i find a lot out just by walking around talking to people supports kws marketing content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to

to steaks and venison and the kinds of things that really go great on the grill my favorite thing probably to eat is fish i eat a lot of different kinds of fish as i travel around and generally whatever is fresh there are lots of ways to cook fish whether it is with core spices or some marinades that create the flavor when i am out i tend to order a lot of fish knowledgewharton when you’re at the grocery store are you ever tempted to give customers advice in the spice aisle   wilson i do i absolutely do wherever i go i go to stores sometimes you will see consumers standing in front of the spice display and looking for something specific and i will help them find it… i will say “try this” or “i see you have some fresh melon try this chilean lime on melon — that is really good”   knowledgewharton do you tell them that you are the mccormick ceo and what is their reaction wilson usually no but i do sometimes go and talk to the grocery clerk who is managing the spice set because i want to find out what is working well what is not working well and they are very aggressive about telling me whether we are getting good service or not and what is moving and what’s not i find a lot out just by walking around talking to people supports kws marketing content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for personal use mla mccormick’s

released apr   on the severn label issued by marylands severn records label the blind owl is  amazingly  the first comprehensive overview of alan wilsons contribution to canned heat the legendary bluesrock band he cofounded with bob the bear hite blind owl buy cd music few would argue that ch were one of the two american groups so deeply influenced by delta blues that they brought the music form wholesale into rock  roll during the mid to late s the other group was of course the allman brothers band blind owl songs compiled and produced by skip taylor the bands manager and producer and chs drummer adolfo de la parra this wonderfully annotated volume contains all the originals wilson wrote for ch as well as the tunes on which he sang lead vocals with his unusual tremulous meld of tenor and falsetto that fueled the bands two biggest hits going up the country and on the road again blind owl album for sale along with his songs and wildly inventive rhythm and slideguitar playing his ingenious harmonica playing must be factored in it was one of the heats trademarks and gave them an otherworldly timeless sound blind owl cd music besides the hits other standout cuts include time was featuring some stellar lead guitar work from henry vestine an owl song with killer piano work from dr blind owl buy cd music john do not enter an angry early example of the bands tranceinducing qualities the haunting and prophetic my time aint long the slow spooky loose and lengthy pulling hair blues and his cover of little walter jacobs mean old world which could have been recorded in the late s rather than in  another highlight is skat the only tune here that showcases the band in the company of horns featuring wilsons scat singing and guest guitar work from harvey mandel the only excesses in this set  though for historical purposes they had to be included  are on wilsons four parts of chs opus of selfindulgence parthenogenesis though they are easiest to endure   see full
