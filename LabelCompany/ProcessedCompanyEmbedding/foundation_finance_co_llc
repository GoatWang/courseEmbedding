does your business have a bad reputation fix it the right way corporate advocacy program™ seo reputation management at its best in  my partner and i purchased our very first home oh how exited we were after a very stressful time getting through the loan process a week later we had a knock on the door from a salesman which we learned is typical of a new build community this salesman was not selling concrete or new back yard but a water system but not only a water system but one that we new home owners needed our home at the time was a new build meaning the pipes are extremely new and had not been used to clear out building debris ie dust etc but we invited the salesman in he then begins to explain his product and what it does and then pulls out his water testing kit then tells us we have hard water its not clear like it should be so on and so forth he then makes ice with our ice maker and shows us our ice verses his ice in a picture dummies we were he begins to explain to us again who the company was who makes this water system nuevia and how we would supposedly pay for this system and how it came with so many perks being that we just went through a loan process out question to the salesman was what is the loan amount and the interest as that was the part he didnt go over before i go into that info let me advise consumers that we were new to all of this homeowners realestate virgins if you rather and were a bit green and naive so he saw dummy written all over our faces but a typical water softener system cost anywhere from  to  on the very highend but he the salesman in a quick spoken sentence rattles out the price of the system is  with no interest and that all payment would be applied to the principle balance which we should have known how did they make their money well i thought it was just off the overpriced system boy were we wrong this system turned out to be a high interest loan with a third party finance company whom apparently loaned my partner and i  foundation finance turned out to be the company and what a rocky path it has been dealing with this company from its extremely rude employees from the call center to the upper management within the call center if there really is such a thing and beyond there i have been treated with the utmost worse customer service when i explained to them that we didnt have clue what they were what the contract entailed and had we known we wouldnt have signed up for this loan as we where instructed by our lender do not run our credit for at least    days after purchase of our home i received rude responses and told oh well you signed a contract as i sit and type this with tears of absolute anger we where sorely taken advantage of a few months into having this system and purchasing our home my partner and i were both laid off our jobs meaning we had a substantial drop in income forcing us to live off of what was left of our savings after purchasing a home and waiting the decision of edd i reached out foundation finance to explain and once again i was treated with horrible unsympathetic rudeness and told that if we didnt pay there would be a lien placed on our brand new home we were terrified foundation finance is a scam and a scheme to put people in debt its a sham of a company since we first initially signed a partial contract as the salesman didnt give us the full contract with important details of this loan foundation finance has been running our credit almost monthly semimonthly or when youre a day or more late on the payments resulting in tanking credit scores and your personal information being thrown at you like a weapon once on the phone with them they feel because we seem to be paying your mortgage and car notes why cant you pay them on time i have asked several times for the part of the contract were we agreed to allow them to run credit checks when we are late on a payment and i have yet to receive that they know they are scammers as they always want to record the payment portion of the call and no other part of the call especially the parts where they talk crazy to you and bully you out of money please please consumers do your homework and if you are not sure about a situation do your own credit check bbb is always a great place to start or simply google the company and put complaints following their name this report was posted on
