the purpose of locating and purchasing used vehicles at auctions from private individuals from other dealers and selling these vehicles specifically to consumers in salt lake city utah on january   we acquired  percent of the membership interests of alpine auto brokers llc a utah limited liability company formed on december   alpine auto brokers llc commenced operations of selling vehicles in approximately march  we then operated through a whollyowned subsidiary alpine auto brokers llc our dealership and executive offices were located at  south state street salt lake city utah  our offices

accounting officer at the effective date of the transfer tsz ting ip assumed the role of director and president chief financial officer secretary and treasurer of the company on july   the company changed its name from alpine auto brokers inc to balincan international inc we were focused on selling older model vehicles with a price range of  to  most of the vehicles we sell are priced under  the majority of our prior customers had good credit and get their financing from local banks and credit unions on june   the company discontinued these operations by disposing of its only subsidiary alpine auto brokers llc which had been the only business unit of the company the company is currently negotiating with matthew pau a minority shareholder and nonaffiliate of the company to purchase all of the issued and outstanding equity of bkg international limited formerly known as getabed company limited bkgi bkgi was incorporated in hong kong on may   by matthew pau and four business partners for the development of a new hostel business in hong kong however as it failed to obtain a valid hostel license it ceased business in january  the company had been dormant for about a year the company changed its name to bkg international limited on february   and matthew pau became the sole owner on july   through its hong kong incorporated wholly owned subsidiary max treasure holdings limited bkgi has set up a retail shop selling skincare and cosmetic products in hong kong with the intention of building it up to be a chain of shops targeted at the local consumers as well as visitors from mainland china the shop is positioned in the middle to upper end of the market with products sourced from uprising brands from countries including the us korea japan and switzerland bkgi has also established a wholly owned subsidiary in china for the development of an online business initially targeted at the female and family markets selling imported consumer goods including milk powder organic honey and meat to satisfy the fast growing demands for safe and healthy food to assure authenticity of products goods will be delivered to buyers direct from abroad or bonded warehouse in china in the near future bkgis online business will be extended to cater for the professional skincare markets sales channels will include the companys own website as well as its own shop on wechat promotion and marketing will be primarily through social media currently it has engaged a sales agent to sell and promote its products through her account on wechat market analysis according to exportgov value of hong kongs market for cosmetics toiletries and skincare products was approximately us billion in  although it is expected to shrink slightly in  and  it is still a sizeable market with fast growing subsegments following the rise in popularity of korean popstars and idols in hong kong in recent years imports of cosmetic personal care and skincare products from korea have been experiencing doubledigit growth over the past few years in  the increase was  resulting in korea being hong kongs second largest source of imports after france hong kong is also a major launch pad for marketing cosmetics and skincare products in the mainland chinese market hong kong serves as a showcase for the millions of chinese tourists  million in  that annually visit hong kong often with shopping for personal family or even resale use as a primary or sole travel objective for local retailers and distributors of cosmetics toiletry and skincare products increased sales in the next few years are expected to continue to come largely from mainland tourists while china has reduced import duties on cosmetics and skincare products thereby reducing the retail price differential between hong kong and china mainland visitors to hong kong are still attracted to products in hong kong over china according to industry sources the perceived authenticity and reliability of the products in hong kong often outweighs price as a buying factor apart from import tariffs that the chinese government imposes on cosmetics there are also vat and product registration costs which do not exist in hong kong meaning that equivalent products may actually cost less on the hong kong side of the border there are no import duties on cosmetics toiletry and skincare products in hong kong and registration is not required for cosmetic products the market is however very competitive with the top ten brands accounting for about  percent of the market demand from tourists accounts for about  of hong kongs total retail sales of cosmetics skincare and toiletry products according to the hong kong tourism board about  of the mainland tourists who visited hong kong regarded cosmetic and skincare products as among their top three shopping purchases according to euromonitor internationals estimates retail sales in chinas skincare and cosmetic products market will grow at an average annual rate of  from  which is much higher than the global average of  and will reach rmb billion in  in  china had more than  crossborder ecommerce companies and over  companies engaged in crossborder ecommerce through different platforms cited by the hong kong trade development council chinas ministry of commerce estimated that crossborder ecommerce would reach rmb trillion in  representing an annual growth rate of over  hence we believe that there exists great potential in selling skincare and cosmetic products through crossborder ecommerce in china competition and distribution the beauty industry is highly competitive and at times changes rapidly due to consumer preferences and industry trends our retail shop will face competition for consumer recognition and from popular chain stores that have achieved significant brand name recognition and consumer loyalty these prominent incumbents include mannings watsons joyce beauty and online shops such as hktvmallcom and hereweseoulcom each of which have launched and are promoting a variety of skincare and makeup brands these companies have significantly greater resources than we do and enjoy a longer history in hong kong these competitors typically devote substantial resources to promoting their brands through traditional forms of advertising such as print media and television commercials because of such mass marketing methods these competitors products can achieve higher visibility and recognition than ours in order to succeed we must continue to take market shares from our competitors across our retail channels we compete with chain stores by strategically locating our shop in prime commercial area we will launch mainly swiss and korean natural skincare products with high popularity among our young target customers owing to the highly competitive nature of the skincare market in hong kong competitive and discount pricing will be offered to attract customers and boost sales turnover in our initiate stage of operation we will keep signing up different suppliers in order to introduce more brands and products into our shop so as to increase the variety of products which can then attract revisited customers ecommerce is an extremely competitive industry in china our competitors including jdcom tmallcom amazoncom vipcom and many other corporate and individual operators from small to the medium scaled provide a large variety of products online both imported and locally made among all these competitors there is a lack of professional skincare products platform where competition is thus less sever as demand for professional skincare products in china is very high we will gradually extend our online shop to sell professional skincare products to freelance beauticians and salons we believe that entering into this specific segment of the beauty market at the present moment will enable us to gain a significant market share in order to compete our online shop will be operating on a zero inventory base which eliminates carrying costs and obsolete inventory costs under such fierce competition our strategy is to increase the number of online visitors while maintaining fixed costs at a very low level that means we will maintain a small operating team in china and use external logistic service providers for the delivery of goods sales marketing and distribution strategy the main marketing channels for skincare products in hong kong will be through advertising in social media such as facebook instagram wechat and weibo and by launching promotional activities including interviews with celebrities and models sales of skincare products will be made through our physical store in prime shopping area in china as sales will be made through our eshop cell phone app and pc marketing activities will be conducted mainly through wechat which is the countrys most widely used social networking app discounts free gifts coupons etc will be granted to attract attention and buyers to the shop assuring customers of the authenticity of our products direct shipments will be made direct from abroad or bonded warehouses in china to buyers through our suppliers using third party logistics companies as a new entrant to this ecommerce industry we expect to incur significant amount of resources in advertising and promotion in order to gain consumers attention and build up a substantial online user base as a result we expect to operate with very low profit margins in the development stage products and delivery the companys skincare and cosmetic products are products sourced from uprising brands in the us korea japan and switzerland the companys retail shop will sell skincare and cosmetic products in hong kong with the intention of building it up to be chain of shops targeted at the local consumers as well as mainland chinese visitors the companys online shop sells foreign consumer goods including milk powder organic honey health and beauty food hair care products and baby care products to satisfy the fast growing demands for safe and healthy food of chinese consumers in order to assure authenticity of these products goods are delivered to consumers direct from abroad or from bonded warehouse in china business will be conducted through the companys own website as well as its own shop on wechat employees we currently have two employees tsz ting ip and chung lai lok initial public offering our form s registration statement went effective on september   it was an all or nothing offering for  presplit shares of our common stock at  per presplit share with a september   deadline to completely sell our offering we sold our complete offering as of january   forward stocksplit effective january   we forward split our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a  for  basis this increased the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding from  presplit shares to  postsplit shares results of operations for the nine months ended september   and  during the nine months ended september   the company had no continuing business after disposal of subsidiary gross revenues cost of sales and operating expenses incurred before the disposal of subsidiary were classified to discontinued operation during the period our net loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended september   was  retractively gross revenues cost of sales and operating expenses incurred during the nine months ended september   were classified to discontinued operation as a result our net loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended september   was therefore  the increase in loss from discontinued operations during the nine months ended september   is mainly due to the loss on disposal of subsidiary during the period for approximately  liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had zero balances in current assets cash and inventory as of september   we had current liabilities in the amount of  classified as other payable due to bkgi which had paid for the legal and administrative expenses on behalf of the company off balance sheet arrangements as of september   there were no off balance sheet arrangements going concern we have experienced recurring losses from operations and we had an accumulated deficit of  as of september   to date we have not been able to produce sufficient sales to become cash flow positive and be profitable on a consistent basis the success of our business plan during the next  months and beyond will be contingent upon generating sufficient revenue to cover our costs of operations andor upon obtaining additional financing for these reasons our auditor has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management discussion and analysis the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we do not believe that any accounting policies currently fit this definition recently issued accounting pronouncements our management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements our management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements oct   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage us stocks trade in record
