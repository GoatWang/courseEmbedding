comprehensive abortion reform act by its sponsors proponents of the bill argued the legislation would strengthen lateterm abortion laws and prevent socalled coerced abortions particularly with respect to minors the kansas city star reported that hs sb  would have required the state of kansas to collect patient diagnostic information providing detailed medical justification for lateterm abortions and would have also permitted litigants to sue abortion providers if they thought that a relative of theirs was planning a lateterm abortion in violation of kansas law sebelius objected to the constitutionality efficacy and morality of the proposed legislation she wrote the united states supreme court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the womans life or health however sb  allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion even where it may be necessary to save her life i am concerned that the bill is unconstitutional or even worse endangers the lives of women in addition she expressed concern that the bill would likely encourage extensive litigation and that it unnecessarily jeopardizes the privacy of kansas womens confidential medical records sebelius is a member of the catholic church however in early march  thenarchbishop raymond leo burke

pilledit despite her prochoice view in december  sebelius overruled the fdas recommendation on making the morningafter pill plan b onestep available over the counter for females under the age of  president obama said that the decision was sebeliuss not his judge edward r korman of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york struck down this restriction calling it frivolous and silly and alleging that pure politics — not scientific evidence — was behind efforts by kathleen sebelius the secretary of health and human services to block easier distribution to young girls the obama administration in response lowered the age limit from  to  but decided to appeal this ruling to maintain the loosened restrictions in a move that was widely criticized by advocates of reproductive rights capital punishmentedit sebelius is an opponent of capital punishment during her first term the kansas capital punishment laws were declared unconstitutional by the kansas supreme court however on appeal by kansass attorney general phill kline the ruling was again overturned and the current law reinstated by the united states supreme court drug importationedit as governor of kansas sebelius adopted a state drug importation program in  to help her constituents afford prescription medication the program called isaverx connected individuals with and helped them buy medication from licensed pharmacies in canada ireland and the united kingdom the program later went on to include australia and new zealand due to federal laws prohibiting personal drug importation under most circumstances the fda intercepted some prescription orders en route to americans who participated in isaverx while in most cases prescription imports for personal use are not seized educationedit sebelius at cool springs elementary school in adelphi maryland early in the term sebelius made education funding her top priority education funding reached a breaking point in the summer of  when the kansas supreme court ordered the legislature to increase k– funding sebelius offered one education funding plan early in her first term which consisted of property sales and income tax increases resulting in  in the largest k– education funding increase in the history of the state the threeyear plan aimed to increase education funding by nearly  billion over three years but did not

own firearms but does not believe a broad concealed carry law would make them safer i dont believe allowing people to carry concealed handguns into sporting events shopping malls grocery stores or the workplace would be good public policy and to me the likelihood of exposing children to loaded handguns in their parents purses pockets and automobiles is simply unacceptable sebelius vetoed like her republican predecessor bill graves a concealedcarry law that would have allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons after obtaining a state permit and passing an fbi background check the veto left kansas at the time as one of four states without any form of a concealcarry law on march   she vetoed senate bill  a similar concealedcarry bill on march  her veto was overturned after the kansas

stated that abortions declined  during her tenure as governor according to the kansas department of health and environment statistics the number of induced abortions in kansas declined by  or  from  to  the year of the most recently available statistics her administration attributes the decline to health care reforms that sebelius initiated including adoption incentives extended health services

reliable us statistics sebelius has been endorsed by planned parenthood which has raised funds on her behalf in    and again in  sebelius vetoed legislation that would have limited abortions in kansas on april   sebelius vetoed house substitute for senate bill  titled the comprehensive abortion reform act by its sponsors proponents of the bill argued the legislation would strengthen lateterm abortion laws and prevent socalled coerced abortions particularly with respect to minors the kansas city star reported that hs sb  would have required the state of kansas to collect patient diagnostic information providing detailed medical justification for lateterm abortions and would have also permitted litigants to sue abortion providers if they thought that a relative of theirs was planning a lateterm abortion in violation of kansas law sebelius objected to the constitutionality efficacy and morality of the proposed legislation she wrote the united states supreme court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the womans life or health however sb  allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion even where it may be necessary to save her life i am concerned that the bill is unconstitutional or even worse endangers the lives of women in addition she expressed concern that the bill would likely encourage extensive litigation and that it unnecessarily jeopardizes the privacy of kansas womens confidential medical records sebelius is a member of the catholic church however in early march  thenarchbishop raymond leo burke prefect for the apostolic signatura the holy sees highest court declared that sebelius should not approach the altar for communion in the united states saying that after pastoral admonition she obstinately persists in serious sin kansas city archbishop joseph fred naumann also asked that sebelius no longer receive holy communion because of her position on abortion naumann criticized sebelius for vetoing hs sb  the action received mixed reviews in the catholic press antiabortion activists criticized sebeliuss hhs nomination because she had received donations to her campaign from george tiller the medical director of an abortion clinic in wichita not long after sebelius was sworn in as hhs secretary on may   tiller was shot through the eye and killed by scott roeder morningafter pilledit despite her prochoice view in december  sebelius overruled the fdas recommendation on making the morningafter pill plan b onestep available over the counter for females under the age of  president obama said that the decision was sebeliuss not his judge edward r korman of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york struck down this restriction calling it frivolous and silly and alleging that pure politics — not scientific evidence — was behind efforts by kathleen sebelius the secretary of health and human services to block easier distribution to young girls the obama administration in response lowered the age limit from  to  but decided to appeal this ruling to maintain the loosened restrictions in a move that was widely criticized by advocates of reproductive rights capital punishmentedit sebelius is an opponent of capital punishment during her first term the kansas capital punishment laws were declared unconstitutional by the kansas supreme court however on appeal by kansass attorney general phill kline the ruling was again overturned and the current law reinstated by the united states

connected individuals with and helped them buy medication from licensed pharmacies in canada ireland and the united kingdom the program later went on to include australia and new zealand due to federal laws prohibiting personal drug importation under most circumstances the fda intercepted some prescription orders en route to americans who participated in isaverx while in most cases prescription imports for personal use are not seized educationedit sebelius at cool springs elementary school in adelphi maryland early in the term sebelius made education funding her top priority education funding reached a breaking point in the summer of  when the kansas supreme court ordered the legislature to increase k– funding sebelius offered one education funding plan early in her first term which consisted of property sales and income tax increases resulting in  in the largest k– education funding increase in the history of the state the threeyear plan aimed to increase education

working group charged with helping to develop practical economical state and federal public health and environmental standards related to natural gas production firearmsedit sebelius and eric holder sebelius has said she supports kansans right to own firearms but does not believe a broad concealed carry law would make them safer i dont believe allowing people to carry concealed handguns into sporting events shopping malls grocery stores or the workplace would be good public policy and to me the likelihood of exposing children to loaded handguns in their parents purses pockets and automobiles is simply unacceptable sebelius vetoed like her republican predecessor bill graves a concealedcarry law that would have allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons after obtaining a state permit and passing an fbi background check the veto left kansas at the time as one of four states without any form of a concealcarry law on march   she vetoed senate bill  a similar concealedcarry bill on march  her veto was overturned after the kansas house of representatives voted – to override it this followed the kansas senates  override vote which occurred the day after her veto on april   sebelius signed senate bill  into law which repealed a  state law prohibiting civilian ownership of machine guns and other firearms restricted by the national firearms act of  specifically permitting ownership by civilians successfully meeting the requirements of the nfa the law was passed in part to address legal issues that could have prevented dealers from delivering firearms to law enforcement agencies in kansas the law took effect on july   lgbt issuesedit sebelius did not support an april  amendment to the kansas constitution that made samesex marriage in the state unconstitutional

stated that abortions declined  during her tenure as governor according to the kansas department of health and environment statistics the number of induced abortions in kansas declined by  or  from  to  the year of the most recently available statistics her administration attributes the decline to health care reforms that sebelius initiated including adoption incentives extended health services

reliable us statistics sebelius has been endorsed by planned parenthood which has raised funds on her behalf in    and again in  sebelius vetoed legislation that would have limited abortions in kansas on april   sebelius vetoed house substitute for senate bill  titled the comprehensive abortion reform act by its sponsors proponents of the bill argued the legislation would strengthen lateterm abortion laws and prevent socalled coerced abortions particularly with respect to minors the kansas city star reported that hs sb  would have required the state of kansas to collect patient diagnostic information providing detailed medical justification for lateterm abortions and would have also permitted litigants to sue abortion providers if they thought that a relative of theirs was planning a lateterm abortion in violation of kansas law sebelius objected to the constitutionality efficacy and morality of the proposed legislation she wrote the united states supreme court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the womans life or health however sb  allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion even where it may be necessary to save her life i am concerned that the bill is unconstitutional or even worse endangers the lives of women in addition she expressed concern that the bill would likely encourage extensive litigation and that it unnecessarily jeopardizes the privacy of kansas womens confidential medical records sebelius is a member of the catholic church however in early march  thenarchbishop raymond leo burke prefect for the apostolic signatura the holy sees highest court declared that sebelius should not approach the altar for communion in the united states saying that after pastoral admonition she obstinately persists in serious sin kansas city archbishop joseph fred naumann also asked that sebelius no longer receive holy communion because of her position on abortion naumann criticized sebelius for vetoing hs sb  the action received mixed reviews in the catholic press antiabortion activists criticized sebeliuss hhs nomination because she had received donations to her campaign from george tiller the medical director of an abortion clinic in wichita not long after sebelius was sworn in as hhs secretary on may   tiller was shot through the eye and killed by scott roeder morningafter pilledit despite her prochoice view in december  sebelius overruled the fdas recommendation on making the morningafter pill plan b onestep available over the counter for females under the age of  president obama said that the decision was sebeliuss not his judge edward r korman of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york struck down this restriction calling it frivolous and silly and alleging that pure politics — not scientific evidence — was behind efforts by kathleen sebelius the secretary of health and human services to block easier distribution to young girls the obama administration in response lowered the age limit from  to  but decided to appeal this ruling to maintain the loosened restrictions in a move that was widely criticized by advocates of reproductive rights capital punishmentedit sebelius is an opponent of capital punishment during her first term the kansas capital punishment laws were declared unconstitutional by the kansas supreme court however on appeal by kansass attorney general phill kline the ruling was again overturned and the current law reinstated by the united states supreme court drug importationedit as governor of kansas sebelius adopted a state drug importation program in  to help her constituents afford prescription medication the program called isaverx connected individuals with and helped them buy medication from licensed pharmacies in canada ireland and the united kingdom the program later went on to include australia and new zealand due to federal laws prohibiting personal drug importation under most circumstances the fda intercepted some prescription orders en route to americans who participated in isaverx while in most cases prescription imports for personal use are not seized educationedit sebelius at cool springs elementary school in adelphi maryland early in the term sebelius made education funding her top priority education funding reached a breaking point in the summer of  when the kansas supreme court ordered the legislature to increase k– funding sebelius offered one education funding plan early in her first term which consisted of property sales and income tax increases resulting in  in the largest k– education funding increase in the history of the state the threeyear plan aimed to increase education

the state in addition she vetoed bills authorizing the construction of coalfired power plants on three separate occasions saying in march  we know that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change as

have a role in the development of regulations governing hydraulic fracturing president obama issued an executive order enabling the center for disease control cdc to participate in an interagency working group charged with helping to develop practical economical state and federal public health and environmental standards related to natural gas production firearmsedit sebelius and eric holder sebelius has said she supports kansans right to own firearms but does not believe a broad concealed carry law would make them safer i dont believe allowing people to carry concealed handguns into sporting events shopping malls grocery stores or the workplace would be good public policy and to me the likelihood of exposing children to loaded handguns in their parents purses pockets and automobiles is simply unacceptable sebelius vetoed like her republican predecessor bill graves a concealedcarry law that would have allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons after obtaining a state permit and passing an fbi background check the veto left kansas at the time as one of four states without any form of a concealcarry law on march   she vetoed senate bill  a similar concealedcarry bill on march  her veto was overturned after the kansas house of representatives voted – to override it this followed the kansas senates  override vote which occurred the day after her veto on april   sebelius signed senate bill  into law which repealed a  state law prohibiting civilian ownership of machine guns and other firearms restricted by the national firearms act of  specifically permitting ownership by civilians successfully meeting the requirements of the nfa the law was passed in part to address legal issues that could have prevented dealers from delivering firearms to law enforcement agencies in kansas the law took effect on july   lgbt issuesedit sebelius did not support an april  amendment to the kansas constitution that made samesex marriage in the state unconstitutional

set sign up invalid email address got it got it by kathleen sebelius by kathleen sebelius july   kathleen sebelius is secretary of health and human services the supreme court decision upholding the affordable care act was a turning point in the healthcare debate a chance to stop refighting old political battles and move forward with implementing and improving a law that is already lowering healthcare costs and providing more security for millions of american families instead congressional republicans will spend wednesday staging yet another repeal vote fortunately for those americans whose health and finances depend on protections in the law the vote is only symbolic but it’s worth setting the record straight about some false claims that have recently resurfaced one claim is that the affordable care act is driving up americans’ healthcare costs the facts tell a different story in the decade before the law was passed national health expenditures increased about  percent a year but in the past two years those increases have dropped to less than  percent per year saving americans more than  billion and that trend is expected to continue with healthcare costs projected to stay level as a share of gross domestic product from  all the way through  you can see the same trend with premiums between  and  the average family premium more than doubled from  to  an annual increase of  percent from  to  family premiums still rose — but at a rate  percent lower that generated savings of more than  per family a trend of lower premium increases that independent experts such as mercer the human resources consultant and the nonprofit national business group on health project will continue and the law will provide even more relief in the years to come including a tax cut averaging  for  million middleclass americans — a tax break that repeal would eliminate another falsehood repeated by opponents of the law is that it is putting a greater burden on small businesses again the facts show that the opposite is true smallbusiness owners were struggling in the health insurance market long before the law passed spending an average of  percent more than their large competitors annually for health coverage and often seeing their insurance bills skyrocket if a single employee got sick the result was that the number of small businesses in the united states offering coverage to employees was falling rapidly — from nearly  percent in  to less than  percent of employers by  — leaving millions of working families without coverage since the law passed the share of small businesses offering employee coverage has held steady at  percent the kaiser family foundation has found in part because new tax credits in the law are saving hundreds of thousands of small companies thousands of dollars each on their insurance costs and independent experts such as rand corp predict the number of employers offering coverage will rise in  — just as it did in massachusetts after health reform was passed — when smallbusiness owners have the choice of shopping for health coverage in new competitive marketplaces a third false attack recycled in recent weeks is that the affordable care act cuts medicare benefits in truth medicare is stronger than ever thanks to the law seniors have new benefits such as free preventive care as well as discounts on brandname medications in the “doughnut hole” coverage gap that have already saved more than  million people with medicare about  each medicare advantage premiums have fallen two years running new crackdowns on fraud and abuse returned a record  billion to medicare in  and  and the healthcare law has strengthened medicare’s longterm outlook adding eight additional years to the projected solvency of the medicare trust fund those calling for repeal have yet to propose credible ideas for lowering healthcare costs in fact the same house republicans who are voting wednesday to repeal these medicare savings voted to keep them in their budget in march people are entitled to their opinions but not to their own facts and the facts in this case are clear since the affordable care act was passed national health spending is rising at a slower rate health insurance premiums are rising at a slower rate smallbusiness coverage is holding steady and medicare is on a stronger financial footing now that the supreme court has issued a decision the american people would be better served if congress joined the president in working to build on that progress not undo it read more about this debate

  sebelius announced her resignation from her position as secretary of health and human services assumedly tentative upon the confirmation of her successor sylvia mathews burwell was nominated that same day as her successor political positionsedit abortionedit sebelius is staunchly prochoice her office stated that abortions declined  during her tenure as governor according to the kansas department of health and environment statistics the number of induced abortions in kansas declined by  or  from  to  the year of the most recently available statistics her administration attributes the decline to health care reforms that sebelius initiated including adoption incentives extended health services for pregnant women sex education and a variety of support services for families nationally the number of abortions declined approximately  from  to  the year of the most recently available and reliable us statistics sebelius has been endorsed by planned parenthood which has raised funds on her behalf in    and again in  sebelius vetoed legislation that would have limited abortions in kansas on april   sebelius vetoed house substitute for senate bill  titled the comprehensive abortion reform act by its sponsors proponents of the bill argued the legislation would strengthen lateterm abortion laws and prevent socalled coerced abortions particularly with respect to minors the kansas city star reported that hs sb  would have required the state of kansas to collect patient diagnostic information providing detailed medical justification for lateterm abortions and would have also permitted litigants to sue abortion providers if they thought that a relative of theirs was planning a lateterm abortion in violation of kansas law sebelius objected to the constitutionality efficacy and morality of the proposed legislation she wrote the united states supreme court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the womans life or health however sb  allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion even where it may be necessary to save her life i am concerned that the bill is unconstitutional or even worse endangers the lives of women in addition she expressed concern that the bill would likely encourage extensive litigation and that it unnecessarily jeopardizes the privacy of kansas womens confidential medical records sebelius is a member of the catholic church however in early march  thenarchbishop raymond leo burke prefect for the apostolic signatura the holy sees highest court declared that sebelius should not approach the altar for communion in the united states saying that after pastoral admonition she obstinately persists in serious sin kansas city archbishop joseph fred naumann also asked that sebelius no longer receive holy communion because of her position on abortion naumann criticized sebelius for vetoing hs sb  the action received mixed reviews in the catholic press antiabortion activists criticized sebeliuss hhs nomination because she had received donations to her campaign from george tiller the medical director of an abortion clinic in wichita not long after sebelius was sworn in as hhs secretary on may   tiller was shot through the eye and killed by scott roeder morningafter pilledit despite her prochoice view in december  sebelius overruled the fdas recommendation on making the morningafter pill plan b onestep available over the counter for females under the age of  president obama said that the decision was sebeliuss not his judge edward r korman of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york struck down this restriction calling it frivolous and silly and alleging that pure politics — not scientific evidence — was behind efforts by kathleen sebelius the secretary of health and human services to block easier distribution to young girls the obama administration in response lowered the age limit from  to  but decided to appeal this ruling to maintain the loosened restrictions in a move that was widely criticized by advocates of reproductive rights capital punishmentedit sebelius is an opponent of capital punishment during her first term the kansas capital punishment laws were declared unconstitutional by the kansas supreme court however on appeal by kansass attorney general phill kline the ruling was again overturned and the current law reinstated by the united states supreme court drug importationedit as governor of kansas sebelius adopted a state drug importation program in  to help her constituents afford prescription medication the program called isaverx connected individuals with and helped them buy medication from licensed pharmacies in canada ireland and the united kingdom the program later went on to include australia and new zealand due to federal laws prohibiting personal drug importation under most circumstances the fda intercepted some prescription orders en route to americans who participated in isaverx while in most cases prescription imports for personal use are not seized educationedit sebelius at cool springs elementary school in adelphi maryland early in the term sebelius made education funding her top priority education funding reached a breaking point in the summer of  when the kansas supreme court ordered the legislature to increase k– funding sebelius offered one education funding plan early in her first term which consisted of property sales and income tax increases resulting in  in the largest k– education funding increase in the history of the state the threeyear plan aimed to increase education funding by nearly  billion over three years but did not

practical economical state and federal public health and environmental standards related to natural gas production firearmsedit sebelius and eric holder sebelius has said she supports kansans right to own firearms but does not believe a broad concealed carry law would make them safer i dont believe allowing people to carry concealed handguns into sporting events shopping malls grocery stores or the workplace would be good public policy and to me the likelihood of exposing children to loaded handguns in their parents purses pockets and automobiles is simply unacceptable sebelius vetoed like her republican predecessor bill graves a concealedcarry law that would have allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons after obtaining a state permit and passing an fbi background check the veto left kansas at the time as one of four states without any form of a concealcarry law on march   she vetoed senate bill  a similar concealedcarry bill on march  her veto was overturned after the kansas house of representatives voted – to override it this followed the kansas senates  override vote which occurred the day after her veto on april   sebelius signed senate bill  into law which repealed a  state law prohibiting civilian ownership of machine guns and other firearms restricted by the national firearms act of  specifically permitting ownership by civilians successfully meeting the requirements of the nfa the law was passed in part to address legal issues that could have prevented dealers from delivering firearms to law enforcement agencies in kansas the law took effect on july   lgbt issuesedit sebelius did not support an april  amendment to the kansas constitution that made samesex marriage in the state unconstitutional sebelius said she supported the existing state law

product is good videos  taylor marsh facebooktwitterinstagrampinteresttumblrrss homeaboutbooksblogcontact previous next kathleen sebelius “the product is there the product is good” videos secretary kathleen sebelius talks to dr sanjay gupta “the interest is there” – secretary kathleen sebelius in the conversation secretary kathleen sebelius she said there had been  calls with “ plus” accounts of people who are shopping for coverage with monthly figures promised how well is it working “thousands of people have signed up… it is not where we need it to be … the good news is we have a product we have a market we have competitive plans affordable prices and no one will ever be locked out of the insurance market with a preexisting condition and that’s good news…” – secretary kathleen sebelius in what is a stunning admission secretary kathleen sebelius said that president obama didn’t know about the website problems before aca launched on october  secretary kathleen sebelius didn’t consider resigning but simply doing the job she was charged to do which she sees as the most important work of her life dr sanjay gupta pressed her on this topic but resigning wasn’t something she wanted to discuss for obvious reasons “accelerating the fixes” is the first order of business “this will be fixed as quickly as possible” secretary sebelius said but she couldn’t give dr sanjay gupta a specific date “millions of americans want this product” she said which is no doubt a lot of people aren’t tech savvy with “lots of people” wanting a “live body” to talk to about signing up this “isn’t a website it’s about health care and about affordable plans” whether the individual mandate will be delayed is “not really the question right now” according to sebelius “you need everybody to come into the pool… we need people to sign up” secretary sebelius said at the end of the interview that she is looking to the enrollment figures at the end of march  when open enrollment ends it sounds like that’s when we’ll know the full numbers and success of the launch of aca right as the  midterms are gearing up i’m not sure anything kathleen sebelius says will change the dynamic right now but it’s an interview she had to do with more administration officials needed to continue making the case if people don’t have confidence not enough will sign up which will hamper the effectiveness of aca those of us who have insurance aren’t impacted by aca’s open enrollment period but there are millions of uninsured who absolutely do need health care who are depending on the obama administration delivering concerns will remain until stories from uninsured signing up and the numbers of those who getting insurance start shifting and actual numbers of those successfully enrolling are offered and

institute found in december  that between july   and november   president obamas public schedule had no oneonone meetings between obama and sebelius who was in charge of implementing his most important initiative during that timeframe there were  meetings with other cabinet members in response to the claim that the two had not met over that period of time press secretary jay carney stated cabinet secretaries don’t regularly get entered into the visitor logs a department spokesperson backed up carneys statements claiming she is frequently at the white house for meetings related to the implementation of the affordable care act including dozens with the president in the last year alone in fact she met with the president just yesterday the hill released the findings of a freedom of information act request on february   showing evidence of  meetings between october  and october  seven of those meetings were specifically on the topic of obamacare when questioned by the news outlet on why president obama was not aware of the website problems a hhs department spokesperson responded she is frequently at the white house for meetings on a wide range of topics including the implementation of the affordable care act as we have also said the affordable care act is more than just a website and consistent with other significant policy initiatives there was coordination across the administration on a broad range of policy and implementation topics healthcaregov rollout see also healthcaregov website rollout pat roberts calls for sebelius resignation the launch of the healthcaregov website featuring the federal healthcare exchanges created by the affordable care act was met with error messages faulty information being sent to insurers and problems with direct enrollment through insurance companies at an october   promotional event for the website sebelius stated believe me we had some early glitches but its getting better every day sen pat roberts called for sebelius resignation over the struggling website on october  stating enough is enough today i am calling on kathleen sebelius to resign her post as secretary of health and human services secretary sebelius has had three and a half years to launch obamacare and she has failed sebelius testified before the house energy and commerce committee on october   during testimony sebelius stated in these early weeks access to healthcaregov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many americans including many who have waited years in some cases their entire lives for the security of health insurance officials have not released an estimated timeframe for fixes on october  rep jeanne shaheen dnh called for an extension of the open enrollment period while the administration attempted to fix the problems while sen joe manchin dwv was already drafting a bill to delay the individual mandate for a year contracting practices investigation on december   sebelius asked the inspector general of the health and human services department to open an investigation into the contracting practices involved in the healthcaregov website she said the investigations results would help to prevent future issues like happened with the website rollout she also announced the creation of a chief risk officer position in the centers for medicare and medicaid services rite aid partnership on september   sebelius announced a partnership with rite aid to promote the affordable care act throughout the country the company promised to place insurance agents at  of the chains  locations nationwide agents are not to be affiliated with the insurers offering new exchanges but they do receive commission on each policy taken out rite aid also receives a commission per policy sebelius commented on the agreement stating we werent ever going to make this program work from washington this has to be an ontheground effort americans trust their pharmacists often the pharmacist is the ontheground health provider people see the most and know the best so having this critical role in a pharmacy makes wonderful sense steve lonegan a new jersey candidate for us senate spoke out against the agreement stating if rite aid and the other big companies are so enthusiastic and think this is such a great plan let it stand on its own two feet organ transplant lists in late may  sebelius was involved in debate over transplant lines for adult lungs policy requires that children under  in need of a lung transplant be placed at the bottom of the waiting list for adult lungs while being placed at the top of the transplant list of childrens lungs though they are more rare ten yearold sarah murnaghan of pennsylvania was in need of a lung transplant due to cystic fibrosis she had been on the pediatric lung transplant list for  months sebelius ordered a review of the policy but stated she cant imagine anything worse than one individual getting to pick who lives and who dies on june   a federal judge ordered sebelius to allow murnaghan to be added to the adult lung transplant list giving her a higher probability of receiving a transplant after hearing oral arguments in a lawsuit filed by murnaghans parents a change to the policy would allow about  children annually to be added to the adult waiting list consisting of  patients dr arthur caplan of the new york university langone medical center explained that the reasoning behind the policy is that children generally fair worse than adults after the procedure caplan worried that the precedent set by the court ruling could result in politicizing medical judgements presidential preference  presidential endorsement ✓ sebelius endorsed hillary clinton for the democratic primary in the  us presidential
