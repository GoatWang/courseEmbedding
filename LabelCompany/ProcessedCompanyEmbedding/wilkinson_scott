wilkinson scott wilkinson on home theater episode scott went to see dunkirk in both mm imax and dolby cinema he preferred mm though not a lot of deep blacks but ultimately imax is best because thats how director christopher nolan shot it and he shot it on the same beach in dunkirk belgium with original aircraft and boats the important point is that all the shots are framed within imaxs square aspect ratio of x it makes it very immersive leo says its a great movie beautifully done scott agrees and quite historic in its depiction scott wilkinson on home theater episode yesterday was cut the cord day started by tv maker tcl its the day to commemorate canceling your cable or satellite subscription in favor of streaming video online but scott says that while cord cutting is extremely popular the options were getting is really just another spin on the cable model he hopes that someday well get true ala carte programming where you just pay for what you want but currently sling youtube hulu and directv now are all just cable lite and in many ways you end up paying more or the same amount by cord cutting that may be the whole idea scott wilkinson on home theater episode leo and scott talk about cleaning out and organizing the techno spaghetti factory that is wiring coming from all home theater stuff there was also a lot of dust built up and scott says its a good idea to clean out that cruft at least once a year and use iec standard power cables to keep everything consistent leo likes banana plugs and scott agrees but many people dont like them because they tend to be easier to disconnect they make it easy to swap out other tech though scott wilkinson fills in for the tech guy episode scott wilkinson fills in for leo this week so get your home theater questions ready to go scott wilkinson on home theater episode scott says its getting harder for elderly viewers to enjoy the home theater tv experience theres a problem with poor sound mixing on tv sets that makes the dialog difficult to hear and the speakers on todays tvs are terrible thats why scott recommends a sound bar or sound base that goes in front of the tv the sound base will allow you to put the tv on top of it and it wont block the tvs remote zvox has a sound base that has a feature called accuvoice which makes it easier for older viewers to hear the dialog scott wilkinson on home theater episode this week is the th anniversary of star wars and on home theater geeks scott had as his guest one of the original sound recordersdesigners for the film mike minkler he talks about the first use of front to back panning in sound and how george lucas was very particular on how the film would sound in theaters scott wilkinson on home theater episode angus wants to hook up some old speakers to his  hdtv whats the most affordable way to do this leo says who cares if the picture is small if the sound is big scott agrees and says that the best solution is to get the most affordable av speaker or amp you can afford and hook it up make sure it has an opticaldigital input also known as toslink scott checked at lifewire and they say the pioneer vsx  for  is the best value for the money scott wilkinson on home theater episode scott reports that nasa is going to do the first ever live k stream from space they will be sending it to earth at mbs which scott says is really small the backend is being handled by amazons elemental streaming and cloud based processing division which will stream it online via h hevc and then transcoded into h so to watch it online youll need at least mbps of bandwidth scott wilkinson on home theater episode scott joins leo with a great story on avs forum about the sentient singing internet where you can record the music you can hear in your head and yes its an april fools day joke scott wilkinson on home theater episode scott joins us to talk home theater and has questions from the chatroom is there a great ultrahd bluray scott says that oppo is the best out there it supports hdr dolby vision and k but it doesnt support streaming and oppo says that since people get streaming from other devices that it wasnt necessary for oppo to get caught up in that they just focus on having the bluray player still be best at playing discs its everything you want in a player and at  it should another option is the xbox one s but it doesnt

be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give
