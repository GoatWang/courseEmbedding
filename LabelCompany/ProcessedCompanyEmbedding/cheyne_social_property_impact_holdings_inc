market structure buy side looks to fintech sectors  by terry flanagan banks london hedge fund eyes social housing investments share this on stuart fiertz cofounder president and director of research of cheyne capital management said hedge funds have an opportunity to fund social housing as government spending decreases fiertz said in a briefing “there is a role for private pools of capital to replace government spending in a time of austerity” last year for example us alternatives firm blackstone group agreed to buy  apartment blocks in madrid for €m as the city sold assets to trim a deficit when andy rose was appointed chief executive of the uk government’s homes and communities agency last year he said ‘it is clear that continued delivery in the sector depends on the ever closer integration of the public and private sectors” in an interview with social housing magazine rose said “the aim is to work with the private sector efficiently and bring in private sector capital alongside public funding the pressure to move in this direction is greater when the public sector is constrained although public sector capital should always be seen as a scarce resource” fiertz said “social housing could become as fashionable as student housing which is one of the hottest sectors today government grants for social housing have dropped from about £bn a year to zero” in the uk there are  million families waiting to go into social housing according to fiertz “at a cost of £ per unit there is a shortfall of £bn of property” he added it is understood that cheyne capital is launching a social property impact fund a thirdparty social auditor will sit on the investment committee to review each transaction for its social benefit londonbased cheyne capital was launched in  and has more than bn of assets under management the firm invests in a number of strategies including real estate debt corporate credit event driven and equity and equitylinked securities in february this year the firm launched a debtfocused opportunity fund cheyne real estate credit holdings fund iii the fund will invest in core european real estate opportunities mainly in uk and germany across the debt spectrum european banks have shrunk their balance sheets since the financial crisis and new capital requirements have forced them to cut lending as a result banks have reduced loans to the real estate sector in particular to midmarket borrowers providing an opportunity to other providers of capital ravi stickney head of cheyne’s real estate debt business said in a statement “cheyne capital is well placed to source and understand the attractive opportunities arising from the dislocation in the real estate lending and the cmbs market which continue to suffer from a supplydemand imbalance” the cheyne real estate credit holdings fund crech i returned  in  from investments in loans and real estatebacked bonds the value of ordinary shares including dividend distributions in cheyne’s london stock exchange listed company real estate credit investments increased  last year according to the firm visited  times  visits today sign up for newsletter and receive exclusive
