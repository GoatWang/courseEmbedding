franklin square start a nontraded product price war with its cheaper bdc forget  the firms new business development company has a hard cap on fees and commissions at  of gross offering proceeds jan     pm by bruce kelly  zoom is franklin square capital partners the sponsor of a series of nontraded business development companies starting a price war in the nontraded investment industryfranklin square with  billion in assets under management may have lobbed its first grenade last fall when it filed the prospectus for its latest nontraded bdc fs investment corporation iv in its past bdcs franklin square like the vast majority of nontraded bdcs and real estate investment trust sponsors have capped the total commissions paid to brokerdealers and registered reps at a hefty  more secs mary jo white rips bill to ease restrictions on bdcs ten percent for commissions and underwriting fees is the maximum allowed by industry rules ten percent for illiquid investment products like nontraded reits and bdcs have been the standard for reit and bdc sponsors managers and the brokerdealers that sell the products indeed when i have asked industry executives over the years why they have slavishly adhered to the  rule and asked whether it could ever go down they typically responded by going all mc “u cant touch this” hammer on me but the independent brokerdealer industry has faced a torrent of criticism for being tied at the hip to nontraded product sponsors for that eyepopping  when selling a nontraded bdc or reit the broker is typically paid  his brokerdealer takes  or  and the wholesale broker or manager which is usually controlled by the product sponsor takes the rest that  fee structure which can be onerous to the investor if a deal goes sour may finally be changing fs investment corporation iv just sliced off  basis points from the standard commission and underwriting fee nontraded bdcs and reits typically charge clients according to the companys prospectus which was filed in october the bdc is placing a hard cap on fees and commissions and will stop paying fees to reps and brokerdealers when the “total underwriting compensation” equals  of gross offering proceeds the bdc which broke escrow this month is seeking to raise  billion and will invest in senior secured debt of private middle market us companies its currently being sold at  per unit as a “t share” a share class that pays less of an upfront commission to the broker but creates an annual trailing commission more franklin squares kelly growth consolidation on tap in the bdc spaceone franklin square executive wasnt about to admit to launching a price war with its competitors “i dont see it that way” said zachary klehr executive vice president with franklin square “the products price is an important component and investors should look at it but there are many fabulous features for investors in the t share class” it appears however that there is a bit of pricing voodoo in franklin squares ability to undercut its competition in fs investment corp iv the sponsor franklin square is kicking in  cents per share for a commission to the broker thus allowing for a greater amount of the investors money to go to work and buy assets part of the trailing commission pays back the sponsor over time “the sponsor advancing commission the alignment of interests between investors advisers and the sponsor that should generate a positive outcome for all” mr klehr said the cut in underwriting compensation by franklin square comes at a time of incredible change for the nontraded investment industry which took a huge hit last year according to investment bank robert a stanger  co nontraded reit sales in  dropped  from a year earlier to slightly less than  billion over the same time nontraded bdc sales decreased  to  billion there is no doubt that the department of labors proposed fiduciary rule for retirement accounts and the financial industry regulatory authority incs new account statement rule to take effect in april have contributed to that drop while it is often roundly criticized by the brokerage industry for being ineffectual finra has gone through the hard work of making its new account statement rule finras goal was to bring greater pricing transparency to illiquid products and to put more investor money to work immediately rather than in the pockets of advisers and their brokerdealers franklin squares new offering raises the question of whether other nontraded reit and nontraded bdc sponsors are living up to the spirit of the rule whos intent is to lower costs for the products nontraded bdcs and reits remain attractive to some investors because they promise a stream of income in a nearzero interest rate environment is franklin square truly trying to shake up the nontraded investment industry which has been criticized for selling highpriced products to unwary investors or is the firm simply making a good marketing play by capping commissions at  for its newest offering  comments what do you think view comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus recommended for you related stories are music
