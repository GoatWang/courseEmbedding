locations of obstacles or objects building and updating a representation of the environment and returning to a safe location are all tasks that constitute typical activities efficiently performed by

cognitive emotional and motor behaviors this system makes use of passive potentially unreliable sensors analogous to animal visual and vestibular systems to learn while navigating unknown environments as well as build usable and correctable representations of these environments without requiring a global navigation satellite system gnss in phase i neurala and the boston university neuromorphics lab will construct a virtual robot or animat to be developed and tested in an extraterrestrial virtual environment the animat will use passive sensors to perform a spatial exploration task the animat will start exploring from a recharging base autonomously plan where to go based on past exploration and its current motivation develop and correct an internal map of the environment with the locations of obstacles select the shortest path of return to its recharging base before battery depletion then extract the resulting explored map into a humanreadable format in phase ii neurala will enhance and

together on intelligence for cameras jul   motorola solutions announced that it will work with neurala to develop intelligent cameras for public safety users the goal is to enable police officers to more efficiently search for objects or persons of interest such as missing children and suspects the companies will work together to integrate neurala’s ai capabilities with motorola solutions’ software and cameras including its si bodyworn camera the integration will create intelligent cameras that can learn “at the edge” and automatically search for persons or objects of interest – significantly reducing the time and effort required to find a missing child or suspicious object in environments that are often crowded or chaotic neurala’s “at the edge” learning capabilities help solve some of the biggest challenges that come with realtime applications of ai neurala’s patentpending technology provides an alternative to lengthy training for the ai engine so that for example the intelligent camera “learns” to identify the person or object of interest this feature known as incremental learning also reduces the risk of “catastrophic forgetting” which occurs when a neural network forgets its previous training incremental learning also enables enhanced accuracy and latency for realtime public safety applications of ai neurala’s technology enables ai applications to learn at the edge after their deployment” steinberg continued “this can unlock new applications for public safety users in the case of a missing child imagine if the parent showed the child’s photo to a nearby police officer on patrol the officer’s bodyworn camera sees the photo the ai engine ‘learns’ what the child looks like and deploys an engine to the bodyworn cameras of nearby officers quickly

neurala enables developers to quickly add powerful ai software into drones toys and other products industry technology neurala’s new developers program makes sophisticated deep learning neural network ai software originally developed for nasa easy to use and deploy boston prunderground march rd  tweet product developers can significantly accelerate the deployment of ai applications without a team of phd researchers an extensive evaluation of different tools or years of costly rd with the neurala developers program announced today by neurala  neurala makes the neurala brain a deep learning neural networks platform that is making smart products like toys cameras and selfdriving cars more autonomous interactive and useful the neurala developers program has everything a software developer needs to integrate the neurala brain into a target application it includes a set of c apis testing tools code examples and a working program with source code mobile wrappers are provided for android and ios to make integration easier on those platforms the software behind the magic neurala’s neural network software—originally developed for nasa—uses a bioinspired approach to mimic the way the human brain learns and analyzes its environment this software enables a variety of smart products—from selfdriving cars and industrial drones to toys consumer electronics and smart cameras—to learn adapt and interact in real time for example toys can learn to identify their owners security cameras can identify specific threats drones can learn how to diagnose problems at the tops of cell towers saving humans considerable danger and drudgery and selfdriving cars can be safer and learn to avoid obstacles one significant differentiator of neurala’s deep learning software is that it scales from embedded hardware to powerful servers neurala calls this an “anywhere brain” by operating “on the edge” and locally on the device toys can entertain without communicating personal information to a third party and applications like selfdriving cars need not rely on the internet—which can be slow or unavailable—to avoid accidents neurala’s software development kit sdk supports industrystandard nvidia arm and intel processors so teams can develop for the processor that is best for their product instead of being forced to select a highpriced proprietary processor ai for all “the artificial intelligence capabilities we once saw as futuristic possibilities are becoming realities now anyone can easily integrate a deep learning neural network in an app” said massimiliano “max” versace neurala cofounder and ceo “we’ve spent years developing the neurala brain so that a variety of devices can benefit from bioinspired brainpower as we make this technology available to developers for everyday projects we look forward to witnessing the resulting proliferation of products that can learn see and act more autonomously” teal drones is the first in the drone industry to bundle neurala technology in every drone built a powerful and unique differentiator “the neurala brain is giving our drones autonomy and control that would not otherwise be possible” said george matus founder and ceo of teal drones “neurala’s realtime deep learning software is powerful and versatile—and we believe it will find many compelling applications in the hands of the larger developer community” neurala making ai easy building a drone car or robot is difficult building ai is even harder with different skill sets and extensive resources required companies wishing to integrate ai into a product or service have historically faced a long and costly process that involves assembling a team rd deploying testing and optimizing with the “zoo” of hardware platforms and software tools available developers traditionally have found choosing the right fit difficult until after development and testing are done—often taking years and involving an investment of millions of dollars neurala’s developers program eliminates the need for any of that neurala’s new offering allows developers to build and deploy their own ai “brain” immediately the offering is coptimized for realtime control of machines and allows for ·       edge learning onthefly ·       enhanced cloud learning ·       both custom and offtheshelf “brains” ·       cloud postprocessing about neurala neurala inc
