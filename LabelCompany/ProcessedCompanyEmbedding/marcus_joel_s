reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo i never think oh i need to make that decision and i know im right that was hard to learn for a while but ive learned that lesson joel s marcus said credit mark kauzlarichthe new york times this interview with joel s marcus chief executive of alexandria real estate equities was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq what were some early influences for youa i grew up in denver my dad was an entrepreneur and had many careers — he built homes sold cars managed restaurants and then ended up in a political career i was always interested in what he was doing and i spent a lot of time with him when he was working i wanted to be in business from day  how else did your parents influence youmy father and mother were children of the depression they graduated from high school but never went to college they were always very careful about managing money and believed in having no debttell me about your college years i studied accounting because i knew it was an easy way to have a job that was my dad’s mentality — have a skill set that is depressionproof in good times and bad times everybody needs an accountant continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story then i went to law school and after that went to arthur young the accounting firm to become a cpa that’s where i met my first mentor who was responsible for probably one of the most important things that ever happened in my life he took me under his wing and one day he said to me “i’m teaching this tax class over at usc i’ve got a lot going on and i’d like you to start teaching some of the classes” i told him i had never taught before but he said “you’ll figure it out just go do it”i found that i really liked teaching he opened up the world of public speaking to me and i also started doing seminars on taxation which helped me get a lot of new clientsso how did you end up in your current rolei had shifted to a law firm and another moment occurred that changed my life a call came in from an investment banker to the head of the corporate law group who had left the firm but the secretary said to them “joel marcus is here he can help you”i was a young partner at the firm and she didn’t know if i could help them or not but unlike some lawyers who treat administrative staff poorly i had always been respectful and nice to them she reached out to me purely because she liked methe person calling was looking for someone to represent kirin brewery on a big biotech deal with amgen that led me to spend a lot of time in japan and work on other deals in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries because of that work i was approached by the jacobs engineering group to work on a business plan to launch a life science real estate company as a garage startup then they asked me to run it i told them no at first but i eventually agreed advertisement continue reading the main story did you have management experience at that pointi had worked on projects with others but i never had to hire people or inspire them before then i was  and i had no operational or management experience up to that point zero

keep a flat decentralized and crossmatrix reporting organization we don’t have an organizational chart i actually ban org charts from being done because i don’t believe in themi’m a big fan of eric schmidt and the book he cowrote “how google works” where he says you should hire smart creative people and then not put them in boxes give them a lot of authority to do some great things and you’re going to have great results i don’t like hierarchical reporting structureswhat other lessonsi learned early on not to take hard and fast positions if somebody says they want to do something i don’t normally say no instead i’ll say “well tell me why” i may decide i’m against it but i’m open to hearing you debate iti never try to be dogmatic with a no answer i always try to let the person win the day and i’m egoless when making decisions i never think “oh i need to make that decision and i know i’m right” that was hard to learn for a while but i’ve learned that lessoni also always try to get people to have multiple solutions for a problem i never want to be put into a corner or forced down one road there ought to be alternative options that can be successful for us and the key is to have strategic optionalityhow do you hire what qualities do you look for and what questions do you aski like great educational experience intuition and instincts i like somebody who has really done things that are a little bit different one of the questions i like to ask is “if you could do anything and money wasn’t an object what would you do” if somebody’s honest their answer can be meaningful and tell you a lot about themanother one is “what’s the biggest opportunity in your professional life that you’ve missed and shouldn’t have missed” i’m not talking about a job opportunity i mean a missed business opportunity that reveals insight and reflection and ability to learn from mistakes if somebody says “i don’t think i’ve ever missed anything” that’s pretty revealing because we all make mistakes i’m less interested in the fact that you missed something but i am really interested in whether you recognized it and learned from ityou can also tell a lot about a candidate by the questions they ask do they ask basic questions that you could answer from our website if they’ve clearly done their homework then i’m impressed continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback
