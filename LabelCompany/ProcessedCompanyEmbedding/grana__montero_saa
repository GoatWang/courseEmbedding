characterize the graña y montero style  –  gramonvel the adventure of the first years on june   three young peruvian engineers alejandro graña garland carlos montero bernales and carlos graña elizalde with the enthusiasm of youth agreed to form a technical partnership in order to pool their knowledge together in the beginning the company was named gramonvel since the architect hector velarde bergmann also participated as designer during the first few years carlos graña elizalde was the first president of the company he gave the company a longterm corporate vision which has deservedly earned him recognition as one of the creators of the construction industry in peru the company continued to expand its offerings through construction of largerscale projects such as railways and highways previously built only by foreign companies in  it crossed the peruvian border with its first project abroad the nestlé factory in venezuela between  and  the new town of talara was built for

company which was going through a severe crisis due to the expropriations by the military government of companies that were our best clients at this juncture josé graña remembers “i learnt my first business lesson and had to make my first decision i had discovered that companies are not inherited but worked and i had accepted the challenge of the second generation that is how what we could call the transitional or generational overlap stage began because i was not alone we were five partners or families of partners and more than one hundred employees and engineers this process of working concurrently which in our case lasted ten years is probably the most interesting and delicate period i believe that in this period the key word was respect respect for people respect for partners respect for traditions respect for history respect for the company’s values” josé graña miró quesada in  the development of a small brochure indicating the main projects carried out by graña y montero strengthened the recognition of the work done by the first generation to keep the company values alive in turn this attitude helped the present generation to naturally start delegating functions to the following generation in  graña y montero sa inaugurated its new offices in its own threestory building located on the th block of paseo de la república in the district of surquillo block  of the
