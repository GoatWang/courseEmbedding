share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close nicholas wroe friday  january   est first published on friday  january   est douglas dunn is an unlikely vietnam draftdodger he is the most respected scottish poet of his generation a protégé of phillip larkin both as librarian and poet and a longstanding professor of english at st andrews university but in late  while working as a librarian in ohio dunn received his callup papers he attended the medical but soon after left the country and was officially designated a deserter by the american military it was a bizarre and disturbing episode but the impact of dunns exposure to american literature culture and academic life was in part responsible for the launch of a remarkable literary career back in scotland he was galvanised to write and to study the primary product of this work has been  volumes of poetry but dunn has also made his mark as a critic editor and hugely influential mentor to other poets next week sees the publication of his new selected poems the collection opens with work from his groundbreaking  debut collection terry street  in which dunn chronicled comings and goings in a rundown workingclass neighbourhood in hull it closes with poems from his  collection the years afternoon  shortlisted for the forward prize this is dunns second selected poems  the first was published in  in the aftermath of the success of his  book elegies  which was written in response to the death of his first wife lesley balfour wallace in  it won the whitbread prize beating off novels by peter ackroyd  hawksmoor  and jeanette winterson  oranges are not the only fruit  and critics compared the work to tennysons in memorium and hardys poems in memory of his dead wife its impact is still felt the popularity of the book has in some ways overshadowed much of dunns other work but as the poet and critic bernard odonoghue points out it was an important turning point until then he had been well known and respected by other poets its popular success made him a major poetic figure from the outset dunn had been admired by peers for his technical achievements peter porter puts him alongside john fuller as the most skilful poet writing in this country today and a master of english prosody the poet and critic christopher wiseman who in the early s was a pioneer of creativewriting courses at british universities says dunns work provides a wonderful example to students of poetic form he has this marvellous ability to write in the human speaking voice while keeping metre and rhyme and form going it is very difficult but it allows him to sound chatty not dedumdedumdedumish dunn has married these technical gifts to a strong sense of social justice he can deftly incorporate individual narratives within larger social economic and political trends terry eagleton writing in  praised dunn for being able to transcend the two major pitfalls of poetry concerned with working people  bourgeois voyeurism or sympathetic mythification in blake morrison and andrew motions influential  anthology of contemporary british poets dunn was bracketed with tony harrison as being sharply conscious of background and upbringing which sets them at an angle to the cultural establishment that is not to say that dunn is motivated by a chip on his shoulder although he has made significant political interventions  he wrote an influential pamphlet criticising the imposition of the poll tax in the late s  the poet sean obrien a protégé has written that more accurately there is in his work a permanent standoff between private life and political engagement a state of affairs that has become a strategic necessity for his poetry the poet douglas houston a fellow student of dunns in the mids explains that dunn had a workingclass scots upbringing and then by means of ability and education he moved away from that it is a form of alienation that is also in the work of poets like heaney and harrison a lot of their work is a dialogue between class and cultural conventions and personal background and biography dunn was born in inchinnan a village on the south bank of the clyde in  his father worked for a tyre manufacturer and the family at first lived in a company house before moving to a newly built council estate dunn has one younger brother john who is now a gardener although they were only  miles from glasgow dunn says the city was only ever somewhere you occasionally visited for special shopping trips i hated glasgow and still do im not a glaswegian back then inchinnan was rural and while on the opposite bank of the clyde were shipyards and factories  it was quite exciting to see ships being launched and things like that  dunns school friends were farmers boys and there were woods and streams and quarries and other places to explore although dunn describes himself as a bookish child there were few books in the house apart from those given to him as presents but it wasnt entirely unliterary my grandfather who was a coop baker in hamilton was an autodidact he was the type of man who you still get in scotland who knew the poetry of robert burns and things like that at school dunn was talented at english and history but poor at the schools specialities maths and science murray neil who now works abroad for a company that builds oil refineries was a contemporary they used to hike together and go to jazz concerts neil says he was quite a strong personality but also quiet and selfcontained reading the poems you can see those characteristics still coming through keeping going and helping people upstairs to visit his wife yet inside his heart was breaking because she was dying dunns lack of aptitude for maths and science meant that he was unable to get into a scottish university instead he went to work for the renfrew library service he then studied at the scottish school of librarianship in glasgow where he excelled he became assistant librarian at the royal college of science and technology library where he met christopher wiseman a founder member of the english department at the university of strathclyde wiseman introduced dunn to the work of american poets like donald justice james wright and robert lowell  people id barely heard of  as well as offering advice the stuff any teacher of poetry usually gets is  dross recalls wiseman but he was clearly special they werent the finished article but they showed great promise and he was clearly dedicated i remember they had a lot of powerful imagery and subject matter some of which he was not yet ready to really cope with in  dunn left scotland for america and a post at the akron public library in ohio he was accompanied to america by his new wife lesley they met when he worked at a branch library in renfrew she was a civil servant when they married just a few days before leaving scotland but in america she became assistant to the inhouse library artist dunn says that he already had literary ambitions but id kept them quiet where i came from you didnt ponce around saying you wanted to be a poet while he didnt go deliberately to study american poetry i got to review new poetry on a local radio show he also started to write a novel and sent stories to the new yorker they didnt publish them but they did send a very encouraging reply dunn was forced to pursue any literary ambitions back in the uk when the american trip went sour first the dunns were in a car crash in which one of their closest friends a pregnant woman was killed another friend was killed in vietnam and then dunn because he had a fiveyear work visa received his vietnam draft papers on his return to scotland he became librarian at the joseph black chemistry library in glasgow wiseman recalls dunn being shaken by the american experience and was clearly wrestling with whether to stay in librarianship or not dunn applied to several universities and was offered a place at the university of hull to read english he began his course in october  he and lesley bought a oneup onedown terraced house in terry street for £ dunn took on some parttime cataloguing work under philip larkin in the brynmor jones library the poet douglas houston then a yearold fellow undergraduate remembers dunn as more mature than most of us he was married he had been a professional librarian he had lived in america and he had begun to make some impact as a poet he was already publishing in the right places the poet hugo williams was dunns contact at the london magazine and remembers the editor alan ross being very excited when dunn submitted the poems that later made up the terry street collection we had these photos of terry street as well says williams and the fact that he lived there made it all seem so fantastically authentic dunns fellow undergraduates and young poets already regarded him as something of a mentor tom paulin a year behind dunn on the english course used to visit the dunn home and says he was very good to me looking at my hope less attempts to write poetry as to his own poetry dunn says meeting larkin was obviously important although we didnt talk much about poetry we talked more about jazz it wasnt until  when larkin was a member of a committee that gave a gregory award to dunn that larkin even knew dunn wrote poetry but larkin then put in a word at faber that dunn should be included in the first faber introduction to young poets i tend to be a fairly diffident kind of guy explains dunn my blood runs slow but getting published by faber was time for a private hop skip and jump in  aged  he graduated from hull with a firstclass honours degree that year terry street  his debut collection was published it received overwhelmingly positive critical response although dunn also remembers giving a copy to an uncle who said i dont know why you bother you will never be as great as the immortal robert burns if youre a poet in scotland that is the sort of thing you have to put up with dunn shrugs another less than glowing response came in a review from peter porter at first i didnt really like it says porter i have a great lack of sympathy for writers like tony harrison who jet into kennedy with a little bag of their mams sweets in their pocket or something i dont understand why if youve been educated in latin it makes you unable to speak to your daddy and i thought douglas had a bit of that but when i got to know him i realised that i was wrong about him and about terry street  although i think it is still a little simpleminded in comparison with his later work his poetry is wonderfully complex i think his most powerful book is st kildas parliament  dantes drum kit is also very good after graduation dunn began to work fulltime at the library and lesley enrolled at the art school although he was a rising star of the poetry world it was difficult to give readings because larkin his boss wouldnt give him time off i did one reading in the two years i was there it was in manchester and larkin eventually allowed me to take two hours off in the afternoon but i was not allowed to stay overnight and had to work saturday morning to make the time up dunn eventually left the library in  to live in the dordogne for six months financed by a somerset maugham award he says he spent most of his time playing the clarinet and going for walks but he also took on a lot of book reviewing and drafted some short stories later published by the new yorker when he and lesley returned to hull dunn was a freelance writer and lesley got a job in the ferens art gallery where she was soon promoted to senior keeper dunn says that while he admired larkin as a librarian and a poet he wasnt the sort of person you would go to if you were struggling with a poem but not long after dunn went freelance larkin took to calling at his house on the way to work just to make sure i was up and at my desk he wanted to know i wasnt poncing around in a dressing gown with a cigarette in a holder although the two men were close dunn now concedes that the unflattering portrait of larkin that emerged after his death from diaries and letters was one he recognised but he would never have come out with anything racist in my company he says he knew id walk away it was more something he would share with people like kingsley amis as well as his poetry dunn was writing short stories and scripts including the dramas early every morning and ploughmans share for television and scotsman by moonlight and wedderburns slave for radio by now he was plugged into literary london and was in the orbit of the charismatic and influential poet critic and editor ian hamilton as poetry editor of the tls and editor of the review and the new review hamilton published dunns work the men became friends dunn arranged for hamilton to work at hull and later asked him to come to st andrews he sent me a cv but like his poems it was bloody short laughs dunn he could have had a contract tailormade to suit him but he really couldnt contemplate being outside london dunn recalls regular trips to london from hull to have boozy lunches with hamilton and his circle id take a holdall full of review copies of books and sell them at gastons in chancery lane which paid half price so i might have £ in my pocket and could get plastered friends say dunn has a facility for vigorous bonhomie but despite the attractions of grub street dunn says he never wanted to live this life fulltime as he wrote in the poem remembering lunch especially as in my case i was not born ever to expect to enjoy so longdrawnout a lunchtime at steep prices among tolerant waiters resigned to our lasting presences but hugo williams recalls dunn fitting in well enough he was a drinking type and a little bit like ian they had a similar sardonic northern humour and douglass wasnt copied from ian in the same way as everyone elses was it was his own thing dunn was certainly enough of a fixture on this scene to be granted a role in clive jamess  booklength comic poem peregrine prykkes pilgrimage through the london literary world where he became douglas dunge a moralising bard of wide remark but as peter porter explains people were serious about their literature even though their behaviour might have been drunken or peculiar as a writer despite the success of terry street  dunn was struggling to find his way my first book made things difficult because it got such a large press it also associated me with larkin and was a very easily classifiable subject and so in a way it typecast me i wasnt going to get over that with the second book  the happier life   and i was disappointed as it was a bit transitional there are one or two things i like in my third book  love or nothing   but it was with barbarians  that i think i started to get a more mature style dunn remembers telling the increasingly deaf larkin who was concerned that dunn hadnt published for some time about barbarians  he looked a bit off at first but then he laughed and said oh god for a moment i thought you said librarians by now dunn was shaping the careers of other poets he recommended tom paulin to faber in the mids and by the end of that decade was orchestrating a vibrant poetry scene in hull douglas houston returned to hull as a postgraduate specifically to immerse myself in the unique poetic environment up there houston calls dunn a man of great rigour he has never suffered fools gladly either in person or in their verse he was a very assiduous mentor to a whole clan of poets in hull but he couldnt be pleased easily you really had to ring the bells to get the thumbs up from douglas with sean obrien and peter didsbury i was part of a group over which douglas presided  in the most informal of senses but we recognised his authority in  dunn edited an anthology of work by writers associated with hull a rumoured city  and even persuaded the reticent larkin to contribute a foreword dunn had emerged as a critic and editor with a selection of byrons verse in  he edited the first collection of essays about the new northern irish writers i always felt closer to the northern ireland poets than to english poets and my generation of scottish poets is pretty thin on the ground in  lesley was diagnosed with cancer of the eye this stanza comes from the poem second opinion in elegies  they called me in what moment worse than that young doctor trying to explain its large and growing what is malignancy why there shes an artist lesley died aged  in  dunns book of that year st kildas parliament  won the hawthornden prize dunn took up a post at dundee university as writerinresidence and wrote the poems that became elegies  i didnt think of it as a collection at first he says i just wrote a number of poems although i knew i was writing about the same subject again and again the huge and ongoing public response to the book surprised him but despite the obvious mixed emotions he says it was ultimately gratifying in the sense that i knew my wife wasnt going to be forgotten in  the same year elegies was pub lished dunn married lesley bathgate a wood engraver they have two children robbie who is  this month and lillias who is  and has had two poems published in an anthology dunn and lesley separated in  and he now lives alone in the village of dairsie about nine miles from st andrews dunn published his selected poems in  and then another collection northlight in  although his work has attracted consistent critical acclaim when he was offered a professorship at st andrews in  he jumped at the chance the fact was that my income compared to the amount of time it took to earn it was pitiful he later became head of school and director of the scottish studies institute he now heads the creative writing course where he has assembled a strong cast of writers including john burnside kathleen jamie don paterson and a l kennedy matt thorne a former student wrote his first novel tourist  while at st andrews and says dunn really makes the course we had this big session where he taught me enough to be going on with in the literary world for the next couple of years i said that i doubted i could become a writer straight away so asked for some advice about getting work in the literary industry he said it was more like the literary indolence and that i should start writing as soon as possible it was good advice although claiming that poems dont come to him as readily as they once did dunn has managed to produce while a fulltime academic dantes drum kit in  and in  the long verse novel the donkeys ears and the collection the years afternoon  he has also edited anthologies of scottish literature the range of his work and the variety of approaches he has used within his poetry are widely commended he is writing another long poem and working on some long short stories although these have been stalled as he can only write prose on an electric typewriter which has now broken it has not been possible to get it repaired he writes poetry in longhand looking back over all his poetry in preparing the new selected poems he found fairly chastening almost everything i have written has been dictated by something that has happened to me that is why i dont read my poems too much i often wish i was another type of artist like a musician or a painter a painter sells his work and it goes away and he might never see it again as a poet i think id prefer it that you wrote something and it was published and you would never see it again some poems you wish you had never written and some you would want to revise some poets take the opportunity to revise but i resisted that ive taken the pontius pilate line he finally smiles  what i have written i have written life at a glance douglas eaglesham dunn born october   inchinnan scotland education inchinnan primary
