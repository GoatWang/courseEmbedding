dosch  simple but effective linkedin tips why you need a linkedin part  in my last blog post i talked about the importance for any aspiring or working professional inside or outside of hr to not only have but actively use linkedin  when i say “actively” i mean actually use it  many people will set up a subpar and boring profile and will only get on the site when they have a new invite connection  having a linkedin just to have a linkedin defeats the purpose of it all together  you don’t put all that time and effort into constructing a resume to not use it  same goes with li abbreviation for linkedin…kind of like fb for facebook  it is still a social networking site so you need to be social i will give you some simple but effective tips to amp up your linkedin page  picture you need to have a photo of yourself  i find it very annoying and i’m sure recruiters do as well when you see this faceless image on someone’s profile  it should look professional so a good head shot of you in interview attire is great  i currently do not have any good picture of myself in a suit or tie but when i do i am changing it immediately  now some people are afraid of discrimination or something  first of all recruiters should know the law and wouldn’t risk doing that  plus if a recruiter actually does not have any human decency and would discriminate against you because of what you look like then would you really want to work there  now if you have a picture of yourself shotgunning a beer that may be different eg don’t do that but if you follow my advice with the head shot then you should be good  i mean you don’t go to a career fair or an interview with a bag over your head  tagline most individuals’ taglines will say their current positions at their jobs  it also already says that in your work experience section  instead it should be something about you that is distinctive  my tagline says “budding hr professional and graduate student”  maybe not the most impressive title but it is still a much more interesting than “human resources specialist” i’ll use my best friend eric j dosch for example  his li profile currently says “hr intern at exxonmobil”  first of all e your internship is over  second i almost slipped into unconsciousness from reading that tagline  a better version would be “experienced veteran and graduate student emerging into the hr profession” or something along those lines  this comments on his a work experience b veteran status because many employers look for that with their eeo stuffmy past internship did and c that he is emerging…aka has hr experience but needs a job  you’re welcome eric 🙂  posting  you need to post  it shows that you are actively on linkedin and that you can be contacted  as i said before some people don’t use linkedin and if you don’t look like you use it than a recruiter may not make the effort to contact you  now you don’t have to go crazy like twitter and they should not include how excited about the eotw you’re going to like on facebook  i normally like to post things that are work related or things that i am doing at work  however they should not be things you complain about because you don’t want your coworkers you’re linked to to tell on you  my team had a retreat on wednesday so i posted about that  if i can’t think of anything i will normally try to post something related to the business or the hr world or whatever your professioncareer might be  today i posted a link about how the us economy has added   jobs in the month of september  this also shows that you’re knowledgeable about your field the world of business and that you care about the news hint twitter is a really helpful source of info in more or less realtime  i check li at least once a day i’m at work to post something  recommendations  you know how employers do reference checks bam  no need if you already have a professional who has given you a strong recommendation  the more the merrier for my current job i would love three  i currently do not have any recommendations because my old boss doesn’t believe in li and isn’t social media savvy but i’m working on it …  website  putting a link to your company student organization or school website is good  tip  li will give you a list of options like personal website company website etc and then you can add the link  when you go to someone’s li it just says “personal website”  instead you should use “other” and then you can put a name to your website  so instead of “company website” i have “columbus st community college”  summary  once again try not to be boring  i talk about what i do what i want to do and eventually a generalization of my experience and skills  but you also want to demonstrate you aren’t a robot and was born with a soul so i also put some personal information about how i support nationwide children’s hospital and have a link to my buckeyethon page so people can donate money  i would leave out stupid quotes and how you like cars or shopping from this summary  specialtiesskills definitely have them but be real about them  just because you took a research methods class does not mean that is your specialty  no one likes a liar and that is embarrassing if you can’t demonstrate it in an interview  resume there is a nice feature that allows you to upload your resume  make sure you adjust the formatting and if you have already put up some positions make sure you delete them so that it doesn’t show that you were a ga five times on your work experience  note just because you have the option to write more about your experience doesn’t mean you should  no one cares about every single thing you did…keep it standard resume length  publications  this may not apply to a lot of people but we are in grad school  you may want to include a thesis long paper or anything published here  i was a journalism major in undergrad so i posted all the stories i wrote  i will probably delete them later in my work experience since i have switched career paths  education include it  also this is where you can include that extra stuff that your one page resume did let you fit in about student organizations and leadership positions you were involved with  you can also get recommendations but that is not as important as the ones from your employer maybe helpful if you don’t have that much work experience also listing “graduate student” i think is fine if you’re unemployed for occupation but listing that you’re the “president at student org” under education is something i wouldn’t do but that’s a personal opinion  groups join them  ones in your profession ones in industries you are inwould like to get in  this allows you to expand your network with strangers  and many recruiters will join groups related to their industry to find talent  honors and awards once again i don’t have room for this on my actual resume so list them here  contactpersonal information  you should have the information you want posted so that you can be contacted  you should also have an open profile so that recruiters can look at you and definitely do not make it so that someone needs to know your email to link with you  also make sure people can inmail you  don’t give people to much work to contact you or they may not bother  ps information about your birthday and marital status are irrelevant  using connections  once you’re linked with someone you can go through person’s links as well in your search for whatever so get started  also there are a number of search features you can use to id what you want to look for like fb when it comes to li you shouldn’t just go and link with random people  you’ll look like a lunatic and it will probably get denied anyway  the best thing to do is to ask if it is okay to link with someone you don’t know by sending them an inmail  normally if you explain why you would like to link with them instead of doing it you appear like a rational human being and it is more likely to be accepted  plus by establishing communication you are doing that whole networking thing  asking to be someone’s li friend really isn’t that much networking  recruiters tend to do the same sorry this was lengthy but hope this was helpful  feel free to link in with me here no need to inmail “the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry” so i said at the beginning of the summer term that i was going to write about once every other week instead of the usual once a week  well clearly that did not happen since the quarter and my internship are almost over  i have nothing clear to say so i am going erratically express my thoughts and hope that you enjoy then when you are procrastinatingboredclearly not doing anything important or significant in your life at this time by reading this blog i took one undergraduate course this summer  introduction to counseling psychology  it literally made me want to drop out of the program and go back to undergrad  well actually i have wanted to do that after the first quarter of being a grad student but in a different way  i forgot how easy well at least now as a graduate student undergraduate courses were  i aced every exam but did not start studying for each one until the day of the exam i did not ace the final because it was cumulative and i think i got too cocky  there were loads of extra credit opportunities which i have missed so much  there was only one assignment that required no prior reading or course work to be learned or completed before turning in it was all hypothetical  i obviously aced the class which is great because i am finally close to having a gpa i would actually want to put on my resume  the only thing i have realized is that after a year of classes starting at pm in the evening is that i cannot take any class that does not meet in the evenings and meets more than one day a week  those classes are long but it allows you to space out your work and academic schedule at a better pace  i was not the fan of it when i first started the program but it is what i prefer now i think i have learned a lot from my other  classes  with my teaching adults online class it is very “i am teacher” and not a “i am training coordinator” in how the course is designed and what it teaches you  i figured that was the way it would be designed but i am excited to see how i can apply concepts to this class to the training and development class i take in the spring i have also enjoyed my negotiations class too  not only have i valued the skills i have obtained from practicing my skills in every class but i have also appreciated the chance to interact with some of the mba students as well  my cohort is great but one of the things i liked about undergraduate classes at least my experience is the chance to take classes with different and new people  i hope that any second years taking the class in the fall considers doing negotiations and working in groups with some of the mba students because they are not as intimidatingscaryevil as you think well a few are but i mean you could say that about some people in the mlhr program … but not me  i really can’t wait until fall for football season  but most importantly because hopefully global warming will have subsided and i will not sweat profusely in my house  none of my other  roommates want to pay for air conditioning so i just sit in my room dying on a nightly basis  i actually stay at my internship longer just to enjoy the air conditioning speaking of internships mine is about to come to an end  i did not sign up for the internship blog so i am not going to go on and on about what i have done  but…i did work on a lot of recruiting for student positions particularly the marketing for those positions calculating turnover costs performance appraisals of our managers and enhancing the overall process employees have from being an applicant to starting their first day at this time i cannot think of the hr term to use to describe this  thanks to “excel for dummies” i’m starting to get better with this microsoft product as well i went to the keha concert at the ohio state fair and it was awesome well that’s basically been my summer  i probably will not have anything else interesting to say until school starts so sorry for not meeting your expectations blogwise 🙂 g psif there is any member of the cohort i miss the most it would be eric j dosch because  his postings about me would always boost my selfesteem like no other and  he has the best teeth in the world ppsi have no idea how i am going to manage studying in the fall  i all of a sudden have a tv schedule set tuesdaythursday i am not going to tell you the shows i am watching due to dignity purposes but let’s just say that my dvr has a lot of abc family cw bet and mtv programming recording on a weekly basis topics campus life career stuff class community service exploring columbus fisher college of business full time mba graduation macc
