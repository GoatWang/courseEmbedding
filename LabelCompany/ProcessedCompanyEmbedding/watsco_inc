interest in florida commercial banks inc a bank holding company for approximately us million two years later watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately us million beginning to move in the sedit by the mids watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately us million watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well the us sun belt had seen a boom in housing in the s as many people migrated south and watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts air conditioners used almost yearround in the sun belt usually wore out within – years so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the s even as new home construction slowed by  nahmad was anxious to expand watsco which had considerable cash to invest nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions and even took out an advertisement in the wall street journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him then watsco took an unexpected step its first major acquisition of the mids was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been in may  watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called dunhill personnel system inc dunhill had revenue of roughly us million annually and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years but dunhill continued to be a part of watsco through  when it was sold to ats group llc in  watsco revenues reached us million   entry into hvac distributionedit the real key to watsco’s growth and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter came in  when watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business in  watsco bought  of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the rheem brand name gemaire distributors inc for us million the other  of the company was held by rheem then in  watsco bought a  interest in heating  cooling supply inc the largest independent distributor of hvac equipment and supplies in california watsco had planned to buy  of heating  cooling supply raising money through a public stock offering iraqs invasion of kuwait and the possibility of war in the persian gulf flattened the stock market making watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible and the company withdrew it instead watsco settled for a smaller piece of heating  cooling supply paying approximately us million for a  interest rheem bought the remaining  the acquisition allowed watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern california and arizona and company revenues shot up by  watsco’s revenues had reached us million steady growth in the sedit a longterm replacement cycle was underway in the sun belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the sun belt during the s watsco also grew by expanding into new highgrowth markets it opened a location in las vegas in  anticipating vigorous population growth there the company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of hurricane andrew the hurricane devastated southern florida in  and in miamidade county alone about  homes were destroyed and more than  others were damaged as watsco’s distribution business took off its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business by  about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution manufacturing was profitable and watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls which it sold to oems watsco also began making a new product in  which it called the flash the flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment the flash was manufactured by a watsco subsidiary in hialeah and it was important because the clean air act enacted in july  prohibited the release of cfcs into the air the flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle cfcs in compliance with the law with this new product watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade but it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the s the industry was still highly fragmented made up of many small wellestablished players and watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition “there’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us” ceo nahmad told the wall street journal june   in that interview nahmad also announced that watscos profit for  was expected to go up by about  the company moved to the more prestigious new york stock exchange that year in  watsco acquired central air conditioning distributors inc a north

distribution business growing so quickly watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business in january  the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business which generated approximately  of total revenues in  it sold its manufacturing subsidiary watsco components inc to international comfort products corporation in  watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in  buying a georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry kaufman supply inc had annual revenues of us million and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the southeast us by the late s watsco had become a billiondollar company it had made significant inroads into the hvacr distribution market in florida texas and california key sun belt states in  the company announced that it was ready to move into new england which was new territory for watsco new england was served by some  different distributors and

was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the us improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the sedit in  the company entered another mode concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions it announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations  locations closed in  and  closed in  and the integration of operating subsidiaries which resulted in a more simplified operating structure the company looked for other ways to cut costs too it restructured the business it had bought from kaufman supply which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing watsco also invested in new technology in the early s by introducing acdoctorcom a consumerfriendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning including information on energy efficiency product comparisons and tax and utility credits as well as a way to find a licensed hvac contractor to service their repair and replacement needs watsco reported sales of us billion in  up slightly from the previous year revenues for  shrank slightly yet watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the hvacr distribution market company analysts perceived the hvacr distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented suggesting there was still a place for a wellheeled consolidator watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the s acquiring a number of other businesses including  locations from a former competitor pameco in  it also acquired goodman manufacturing’s largest distributor east coast metal distributors inc in  with  locations in the southeast east coast had been owned by the same family for more than  years watsco then

completed its largest acquisition to date with the formation of a joint venture with carrier in the second half of  joint ventures with carrier corporation in the sedit in july  watsco formed a joint venture carrier enterprise i with carrier to distribute carrier products throughout the us sun belt latin america and the caribbean carrier contributed to carrier enterprise  locations in the us sunbelt and puerto rico and carrier’s export division located in miami florida and watsco contributed  locations that distributed carrier products watsco purchased a  controlling interest in the joint venture for us million with options to purchase up to an additional  interest from carrier  beginning in july  and an additional  in july  this represented a transformational event in watsco’s history the transaction doubled watsco’s already marketleading position and expanded its product lines and brands the company was also able to expand its presence in the us sun belt where its products are of critical importance in particular carrier enterprise added product depth to watsco’s markets with premium level residential products commercial products and the latest energyefficient technology likewise carrier enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure leveraging existing customer relationships and costs carrier enterprise is structured similar to watsco’s other acquisitions with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place a cornerstone of watsco’s operating philosophy the carrier enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of watsco’s revenues by approximately us billion in  “for its part carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines” effective july   watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional  ownership interest in carrier enterprise i which increased the company’s ownership interest to  on july   watsco exercised their last remaining option to acquire an additional  ownership interest in carrier enterprise i

watsco’s revenues for  growth of distribution operationsedit     increase revenues in thousands   x operating income in thousands   x diluted earnings per share from continuing operations   x market capitalization in thousands   x number of locations   x residential hvac distribution industryedit the hvacr distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately  distribution companies the industry in the us and canada is wellestablished having had its primary period of growth during the postworld war ii era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications the advent of hvacr products in latin america and the caribbean is also wellestablished but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity the estimated annual market for residential hvacr products in the americas is approximately us billion residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately  of all units shipped in the us each year these companies are carrier corporation carrier a subsidiary of united technologies corporation goodman manufacturing company lp goodman a subsidiary of daikin industries ltd rheem manufacturing company rheem trane inc a subsidiary of ingersoll rand company limited york international corporation a subsidiary of johnson controls inc lennox international inc and nordyne corporation nordyne a subsidiary of nortek corporation these manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factoryowned and independent distributors who in turn supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers businesses and other endusers air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market the commercial market and residential new construction market the replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces the introduction of new higher energy efficient models the remodeling and expansion of existing homes the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products the mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately  to  years according to data published by the energy information administration there are approximately  million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the us that have been in service for more than  years many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives thus providing a growing and stable replacement market business strategyedit watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial longterm growth in revenues and profits the “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit welldefined financial and strategic criteria the “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies by adding products and locations to better serve customers exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies newly acquired businesses have access to watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service strategy in existing marketsedit watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth higher margin replacement market in which customers generally demand immediate convenient and reliable service the company responds to this need by i offering a broad range of product lines including the necessary equipment parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system ii maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience iii maintaining wellstocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner iv providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and v developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities the company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller lesscapitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations implement technological business solutions provide the same range of products maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering in some geographic areas watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factoryoperated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the timesensitive demands of the replacement market in addition to the replacement market watsco sells to the new construction market including new homes and commercial construction the company believes its reputation for reliable highquality service and relationships with contractors who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets allow them to compete effectively in these markets acquisition strategyedit the company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets since  watsco has acquired  hvacr distribution businesses six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries the other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries through a combination of sales and market share growth opening of new locations tuckin acquisitions expansion of product lines improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth postacquisition watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions andor joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets operating philosophyedit acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the longterm relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers typically watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brandname offerings watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in miami florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies productsedit watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system on short notice the cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons one ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to  british thermal units btus and is

and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications distribution and salesedit the largest market watsco serves is the us in which the most significant markets for hvacr products are in the sun belt accordingly the majority of watsco’s distribution locations are in the sun belt with the highest concentration in florida and texas these markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size the reliance by homeowners and businesses on hvacr products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last  years which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of hvacr equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency in the us cooling and heating accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical home key suppliersedit watsco

inc was incorporated in florida on july   and went public in  in  watsco was listed on the nyse mkt llc formerly known as the american stock exchange in  watsco merged with sun engineering and began its acquisition strategy a small player through the sedit after  watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations headquartered in hialeah florida an industrial area in greater miami the company operated principally in three industries in the s  the manufacture of climate control components for the heating air conditioning and refrigeration industry  the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry and  the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry in  watsco acquired chicagobased wabash corp and kesco products of new york the company acquired allin manufacturing company in  a chicagobased manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants in  the company bought mumma tool  die company in  watsco paid clairol inc approximately us for its sybil ives division which included hair care products such as permanent waves hair sprays hair coloring shampoos and conditioners watsco ran the professional hair care division consisting of sybil ives and winslow manufacturing inc until  in a profile on watsco in florida trend magazine october  the company’s sales and earnings throughout the s were characterized as “unspectacular” the company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different the company came under the control of a new leader in december  albert h nahmad when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder william wagner he became chairman president and chief executive officer and eventually took the company in a new direction nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the university of new mexico and a master of science degree in industrial administration from purdue university he then worked for several years for the conglomerate wr grace  co and for the accounting firm arthur young  co now known as ernst  young for several years under nahmad’s leadership at watsco things did not look too different the company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms including del mar engineering co in  rho sigma inc in  and camstat inc of los angeles in  the company sold its professional hair care division in  for us nearly twice what it had paid for the clairol division five years earlier in addition nahmad made several moves to strengthen watsco’s operations in  watsco’s los angelesbased subsidiaries del mar engineering and rho sigma moved to hialeah where they became part of the production enterprises division in  another california subsidiary camstat also moved to hialeah so that watsco’s operations were not so farflung the company also made a significant investment in  buying an approximate  interest in florida commercial banks inc a bank holding company for approximately us million two years later watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately us million beginning to move in the sedit by the mids watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately us million watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well the us sun belt had seen a boom in housing in the s as many people migrated south and watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts air conditioners used almost yearround in the sun belt usually wore out within – years so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the s even as new home construction slowed by  nahmad was anxious to expand watsco which had considerable cash to invest nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions and even took out an advertisement in the wall street journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him then watsco took an unexpected step its first major acquisition of the mids was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been in may  watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called dunhill personnel system inc dunhill had revenue of roughly us million annually and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years but dunhill continued to be a part of watsco through  when it was sold to ats group llc in  watsco revenues reached us million   entry into hvac distributionedit the real key to watsco’s growth and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter came in  when watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business in  watsco bought  of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the rheem brand name gemaire distributors inc for us million the other  of the company was held by rheem then in  watsco bought a  interest in heating  cooling supply inc the largest independent distributor of hvac equipment and supplies in california watsco had planned to buy  of heating  cooling supply raising money through a public stock offering iraqs invasion of kuwait and the possibility of war in the persian gulf flattened the stock market making watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible and the company withdrew it instead watsco settled for a smaller piece of heating  cooling supply paying approximately us million for a  interest rheem bought the remaining  the acquisition allowed watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern california and arizona and company revenues shot up by  watsco’s revenues had reached us million steady growth in the sedit a longterm replacement cycle was underway in the sun belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the sun belt during the s watsco also grew by expanding into new highgrowth markets it opened a location in las vegas in  anticipating vigorous population growth there the company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of hurricane andrew the hurricane devastated southern florida in  and in miamidade county alone about  homes were destroyed and more than  others were damaged as watsco’s distribution business took off its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business by  about three quarters of the

conditioning contractors to recover and recycle cfcs in compliance with the law with this new product watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade but it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the s the industry was still highly fragmented made up of many small wellestablished players and watsco had many

sunbelt and puerto rico and carrier’s export division located in miami florida and watsco contributed  locations that distributed carrier products watsco purchased a  controlling interest in the joint venture for us million with options to purchase up to an additional  interest from carrier  beginning in july  and an additional  in july  this represented a transformational event in watsco’s history the transaction doubled watsco’s already marketleading position and expanded its product lines and brands the company was also able to expand its presence in the us sun belt where its products are of critical importance in particular carrier enterprise added product depth to watsco’s markets with premium level residential products commercial products and the latest energyefficient technology likewise carrier enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure leveraging existing customer relationships and costs carrier enterprise is structured similar to watsco’s other acquisitions with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place a cornerstone of watsco’s operating philosophy the carrier enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of watsco’s revenues by approximately us billion in  “for its part carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines” effective july   watsco exercised their first option to acquire an additional  ownership interest in

watsco’s revenues for  growth of distribution operationsedit     increase revenues in thousands   x operating income in thousands   x diluted earnings per share from continuing operations   x market capitalization in thousands   x number of locations   x residential hvac distribution industryedit the hvacr distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately  distribution companies the industry in the us and canada is wellestablished having had its primary period of growth during the postworld war ii era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications the advent of hvacr products in latin america and the caribbean is also wellestablished but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity the estimated annual market for residential hvacr products in the americas is approximately us billion residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately  of all units shipped in the us each year these companies are carrier corporation carrier a subsidiary of united technologies corporation goodman manufacturing company lp goodman a subsidiary of daikin industries ltd rheem manufacturing company rheem trane inc a subsidiary of ingersoll rand company limited york international corporation a subsidiary of johnson controls inc lennox international inc and nordyne corporation nordyne a subsidiary of nortek corporation these manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factoryowned and independent distributors who in turn supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers businesses and other endusers air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market the commercial market and residential new construction market the replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces the introduction of new higher energy efficient models the remodeling and expansion of existing homes the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products the mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately  to  years according to data published by the energy information administration there are approximately  million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the us that have been in service for more than  years many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives thus providing a growing and stable replacement market business strategyedit watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial longterm growth in revenues and profits the “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit welldefined financial and strategic criteria the “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies by adding products and locations to better serve customers exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies newly acquired businesses have access to watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service strategy in existing marketsedit watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth higher margin replacement market in which customers generally demand immediate convenient and reliable service the company responds to this need by i offering a broad range of product lines including the necessary equipment parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system ii maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience iii maintaining wellstocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner iv providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and v developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities the company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller lesscapitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations implement technological business solutions provide the same range of products maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering in some geographic areas watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factoryoperated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the timesensitive demands of the replacement market in addition to the replacement market watsco sells to the new construction market including new homes and commercial construction the company believes its reputation for reliable highquality service and relationships with contractors who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets allow them to compete effectively in these markets acquisition strategyedit the company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets since  watsco has acquired  hvacr distribution businesses six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries the other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries through a combination of sales and market share growth opening of new locations tuckin acquisitions expansion of product lines improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth postacquisition watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions andor joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets operating philosophyedit acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the longterm relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers typically watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brandname offerings watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in miami florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies productsedit watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system on short notice the cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons one ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to  british thermal units btus and is

and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications distribution and salesedit the largest market watsco serves is the us in which the most significant markets for hvacr products are in the sun belt accordingly the majority of watsco’s distribution locations are in the sun belt with the highest concentration in florida and texas these markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size the reliance by homeowners and businesses on hvacr products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last  years which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of hvacr equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency in the us cooling and heating accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical home key suppliersedit watsco

inc was incorporated in florida on july   and went public in  in  watsco was listed on the nyse mkt llc formerly known as the american stock exchange in  watsco merged with sun engineering and began its acquisition strategy a small player through the sedit after  watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations headquartered in hialeah florida an industrial area in greater miami the company operated principally in three industries in the s  the manufacture of climate control components for the heating air conditioning and refrigeration industry  the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry and  the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry in  watsco acquired chicagobased wabash corp and kesco products of new york the company acquired allin manufacturing company in  a chicagobased manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants in  the company bought mumma tool  die company in  watsco paid clairol inc approximately us for its sybil ives division which included hair care products such as permanent waves hair sprays hair coloring shampoos and conditioners watsco ran the professional hair care division consisting of sybil ives and winslow manufacturing inc until  in a profile on watsco in florida trend magazine october  the company’s sales and earnings throughout the s were characterized as “unspectacular” the company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different the company came under the control of a new leader in december  albert h nahmad when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder william wagner he became chairman president and chief executive officer and eventually took the company in a new direction nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the university of new mexico and a master of science degree in industrial administration from purdue university he then worked for several years for the conglomerate wr grace  co and for the accounting firm arthur young  co now known as ernst  young for several years under nahmad’s leadership at watsco things did not look too different the company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms including del mar engineering co in  rho sigma inc in  and camstat inc of los angeles in  the company sold its professional hair care division in  for us nearly twice what it had paid for the clairol division five years earlier in addition nahmad made several moves to strengthen watsco’s operations in  watsco’s los angelesbased subsidiaries del mar engineering and rho sigma moved to hialeah where they became part of the production enterprises division in  another california subsidiary camstat also moved to hialeah so that watsco’s operations were not so farflung the company also made a significant investment in  buying an approximate  interest in florida commercial banks inc a bank holding company for approximately us million two years later watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately us million beginning to move in the sedit by the mids watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately us million watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well the us sun belt had seen a boom in housing in the s as many people migrated south and watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts air conditioners used almost yearround in the sun belt usually wore out within – years so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the s even as new home construction slowed by  nahmad was anxious to expand watsco which had considerable cash to invest nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions and even took out an advertisement in the wall street journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him then watsco took an unexpected step its first major acquisition of the mids was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been in may  watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called dunhill personnel system inc dunhill had revenue of roughly us million annually and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years but dunhill continued to be a part of watsco through  when it was sold to ats group llc in  watsco revenues reached us million   entry into hvac distributionedit the real key to watsco’s growth and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter came in  when watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business in  watsco bought  of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the rheem brand name gemaire distributors inc for us million the other  of the company was held by rheem then in  watsco bought a  interest in heating  cooling supply inc the largest independent distributor of hvac equipment and supplies in california watsco had planned to buy  of heating  cooling supply raising money through a public stock offering iraqs invasion of kuwait and the possibility of war in the persian gulf flattened the stock market making watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible and the company withdrew it instead watsco settled for a smaller piece of heating  cooling supply paying approximately us million for a  interest rheem bought the remaining  the acquisition allowed watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern california and arizona and company revenues shot up by  watsco’s revenues had reached us million steady growth in the sedit a longterm replacement cycle was underway in the sun belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the sun belt during the s watsco also grew by expanding into new highgrowth markets it opened a location in las vegas in  anticipating vigorous population growth there the company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of hurricane andrew the hurricane devastated southern florida in  and in miamidade county alone about  homes were destroyed and more than  others were damaged as watsco’s distribution business took off its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business by  about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution manufacturing was profitable and watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls which it sold to oems watsco also began making a new product in  which it called the flash the flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment the flash was manufactured by a watsco subsidiary in hialeah and it was important because the clean air act enacted in july  prohibited the release of cfcs into the air the flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle cfcs in compliance with the law with this new product watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade but it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the s the industry was still highly fragmented made up of many small wellestablished players and watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition “there’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us” ceo nahmad told the wall street journal june   in that interview nahmad also announced that watscos profit for  was expected to go up by about  the company moved to the more prestigious new york stock exchange that year in  watsco acquired central air conditioning distributors inc a north

watsco’s revenues for  growth of distribution operationsedit     increase revenues in thousands   x operating income in thousands   x diluted earnings per share from continuing operations   x market capitalization in thousands   x number of locations   x residential hvac distribution industryedit the hvacr distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately  distribution companies the industry in the us and canada is wellestablished having had its primary period of growth during the postworld war ii era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications the advent of hvacr products in latin america and the caribbean is also wellestablished but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity the estimated annual market for residential hvacr products in the americas is approximately us billion residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately  of all units shipped in the us each year these companies are carrier corporation carrier a subsidiary of united technologies corporation goodman manufacturing company lp goodman a subsidiary of daikin industries ltd rheem manufacturing company rheem trane inc a subsidiary of ingersoll rand company limited york international corporation a subsidiary of johnson controls inc lennox international inc and nordyne corporation nordyne a subsidiary of nortek corporation these manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factoryowned and independent distributors who in turn supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers businesses and other endusers air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market the commercial market and residential new construction market the replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces the introduction of new higher energy efficient models the remodeling and expansion of existing homes the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products the mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately  to  years according to data published by the energy information administration there are approximately  million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the us that have been in service for more than  years many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives thus providing a growing and stable replacement market business strategyedit watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial longterm growth in revenues and profits the “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit welldefined financial and strategic criteria the “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies by adding products and locations to better serve customers exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies newly acquired businesses have access to watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service strategy in existing marketsedit watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth higher margin replacement market in which customers generally demand immediate convenient and reliable service the company responds to this need by i offering a broad range of product lines including the necessary equipment parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system ii maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience iii maintaining wellstocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner iv providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and v developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities the company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller lesscapitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations implement technological business solutions provide the same range of products maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering in some geographic areas watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factoryoperated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the timesensitive demands of the replacement market in addition to the replacement market watsco sells to the new construction market including new homes and commercial construction the company believes its reputation for reliable highquality service and relationships with contractors who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets allow them to compete effectively in these markets acquisition strategyedit the company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets since  watsco has acquired  hvacr distribution businesses six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries the other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries through a combination of sales and market share growth opening of new locations tuckin acquisitions expansion of product lines improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth postacquisition watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions andor joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets operating philosophyedit acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the longterm relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers typically watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brandname offerings watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in miami florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies productsedit watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system on short notice the cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons one ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to  british thermal units btus and is

and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications distribution and salesedit the largest market watsco serves is the us in which the most significant markets for hvacr products are in the sun belt accordingly the majority of watsco’s distribution locations are in the sun belt with the highest concentration in florida and texas these markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size the reliance by homeowners and businesses on hvacr products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last  years which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of hvacr equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency in the us cooling and heating accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical home key suppliersedit watsco

inc was incorporated in florida on july   and went public in  in  watsco was listed on the nyse mkt llc formerly known as the american stock exchange in  watsco merged with sun engineering and began its acquisition strategy a small player through the sedit after  watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations headquartered in hialeah florida an industrial area in greater miami the company operated principally in three industries in the s  the manufacture of climate control components for the heating air conditioning and refrigeration industry  the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry and  the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry in  watsco acquired chicagobased wabash corp and kesco products of new york the company acquired allin manufacturing company in  a chicagobased manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants in  the company bought mumma tool  die company in  watsco paid clairol inc approximately us for its sybil ives division which included hair care products such as permanent waves hair sprays hair coloring shampoos and conditioners watsco ran the professional hair care division consisting of sybil ives and winslow manufacturing inc until  in a profile on watsco in florida trend magazine october  the company’s sales and earnings throughout the s were characterized as “unspectacular” the company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different the company came under the control of a new leader in december  albert h nahmad when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder william wagner he became chairman president and chief executive officer and eventually took the company in a new direction nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the university of new mexico and a master of science degree in industrial administration from purdue university he then worked for several years for the conglomerate wr grace  co and for the accounting firm arthur young  co now known as ernst  young for several years under nahmad’s leadership at watsco things did not look too different the company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms including del mar engineering co in  rho sigma inc in  and camstat inc of los angeles in  the company sold its professional hair care division in  for us nearly twice what it had paid for the clairol division five years earlier in addition nahmad made several moves to strengthen watsco’s operations in  watsco’s los angelesbased subsidiaries del mar engineering and rho sigma moved to hialeah where they became part of the production enterprises division in  another california subsidiary camstat also moved to hialeah so that watsco’s operations were not so farflung the company also made a significant investment in  buying an approximate  interest in florida commercial banks inc a bank holding company for approximately us million two years later watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately us million beginning to move in the sedit by the mids watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately us million watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well the us sun belt had seen a boom in housing in the s as many people migrated south and watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts air conditioners used almost yearround in the sun belt usually wore out within – years so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the s even as new home construction slowed by  nahmad was anxious to expand watsco which had considerable cash to invest nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions and even took out an advertisement in the wall street journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him then watsco took an unexpected step its first major acquisition of the mids was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been in may  watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called dunhill personnel system inc dunhill had revenue of roughly us million annually and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years but dunhill continued to be a part of watsco through  when it was sold to ats group llc in  watsco revenues reached us million   entry into hvac distributionedit the real key to watsco’s growth and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter came in  when watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business in  watsco bought  of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the rheem brand name gemaire distributors inc for us million the other  of the company was held by rheem then in  watsco bought a  interest in heating  cooling supply inc the largest independent distributor of hvac equipment and supplies in california watsco had planned to buy  of heating  cooling supply raising money through a public stock offering iraqs invasion of kuwait and the possibility of war in the persian gulf flattened the stock market making watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible and the company withdrew it instead watsco settled for a smaller piece of heating  cooling supply paying approximately us million for a  interest rheem bought the remaining  the acquisition allowed watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern california and arizona and company revenues shot up by  watsco’s revenues had reached us million steady growth in the sedit a longterm replacement cycle was underway in the sun belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the sun belt during the s watsco also grew by expanding into new highgrowth markets it opened a location in las vegas in  anticipating vigorous population growth there the company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of hurricane andrew the hurricane devastated southern florida in  and in miamidade county alone about  homes were destroyed and more than  others were damaged as watsco’s distribution business took off its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business by  about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution manufacturing was profitable and watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls which it sold to oems watsco also began making a new product in  which it called the flash the flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment the flash was manufactured by a watsco subsidiary in hialeah and it was important because the clean air act enacted in july  prohibited the release of cfcs into the air the flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle cfcs in compliance with the law with this new product watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade but it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the s the industry was still highly fragmented made up of many small wellestablished players and watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition “there’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us” ceo nahmad told the wall street journal june   in that interview nahmad also announced that watscos profit for  was expected to go up by about  the company moved to the more prestigious new york stock exchange that year in  watsco acquired central air conditioning distributors inc a north

distribution business growing so quickly watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business in january  the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business which generated approximately  of total revenues in  it sold its manufacturing subsidiary watsco components inc to international comfort products corporation in  watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in  buying a georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry kaufman supply inc had annual revenues of us million and looked to have a lucrative

had bought from kaufman supply which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing watsco also invested in new technology in the early s by introducing acdoctorcom a

to find a licensed hvac contractor to service their repair and replacement needs watsco reported sales of us billion in  up slightly from the previous year revenues for  shrank slightly yet watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the hvacr distribution market company analysts perceived the hvacr distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented suggesting there was still a place for a wellheeled consolidator watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the s acquiring a number of other businesses including  locations from a former competitor pameco in  it also acquired goodman manufacturing’s largest distributor east coast metal distributors inc in  with  locations in the southeast east coast had been owned by the same family for more than  years watsco then

industry in the us and canada is wellestablished having had its primary period of growth during the postworld war ii era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications the advent of hvacr products in latin america and the caribbean is also wellestablished but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity the estimated annual market for residential hvacr products in the americas is approximately us billion residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately  of all units shipped in the us each year these companies are carrier corporation

ingersoll rand company limited york international corporation a subsidiary of johnson controls inc lennox international inc and nordyne corporation nordyne a subsidiary of nortek corporation these manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factoryowned and independent distributors who in turn supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers businesses and other endusers air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the residential replacement market the commercial market and residential new construction market the replacement market has increased in importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces the introduction of new higher energy efficient models the remodeling and expansion of existing homes the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products the mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately  to  years according to data published by the energy information administration there are approximately  million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the us that have been in service for more than  years many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives thus providing a growing and stable replacement market business strategyedit watsco has a “buy and build” strategy that has produced substantial longterm growth in revenues and profits the “buy” component of the strategy focuses on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets watsco employs a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit welldefined financial and strategic criteria the “build” component of the strategy focuses on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies by adding products and locations to better serve customers exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams and investing in new technologies newly acquired businesses have access to watsco’s capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service strategy in existing marketsedit watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth higher margin replacement market in which customers generally demand immediate convenient and reliable service the company responds to this need by i offering a broad range of product lines including the necessary equipment parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system ii maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience iii maintaining wellstocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner iv providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and v developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities the company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller lesscapitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations implement technological business solutions provide the same range of products maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering in some geographic areas watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factoryoperated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the timesensitive demands of the replacement market in addition to the replacement market watsco sells to the new construction market including new homes and commercial construction the company believes its reputation for reliable highquality service and relationships with contractors who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets allow them to compete effectively in these markets acquisition strategyedit the company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets since  watsco has acquired  hvacr distribution businesses six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries the other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries through a combination of sales and market share growth opening of new locations tuckin acquisitions expansion of product lines improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth postacquisition watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions andor joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets operating philosophyedit acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the longterm relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers typically watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brandname offerings watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in miami florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies productsedit watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner

sun belt accordingly the majority of watsco’s distribution locations are in the sun belt with the highest concentration in florida and texas these markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size the reliance by homeowners and businesses on hvacr products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last  years which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of hvacr equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency in the us cooling and heating accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical home key suppliersedit watsco

inc was incorporated in florida on july   and went public in  in  watsco was listed on the nyse mkt llc formerly known as the american stock exchange in  watsco merged with sun engineering and began its acquisition strategy a small player through the sedit after  watsco bought several small companies in different industries and scattered locations headquartered in hialeah florida an industrial area in greater miami the company operated principally in three industries in the s  the manufacture of climate control components for the heating air conditioning and refrigeration industry  the manufacture of components for doors and windows in the building industry and  the production and sale of professional hair care products for the beauty salon industry in  watsco acquired chicagobased wabash corp and kesco products of new york the company acquired allin manufacturing company in  a chicagobased manufacturer of specialty air conditioning components called “sight glasses” devices used to observe the clarity of refrigerants in  the company bought mumma tool  die company in  watsco paid clairol inc approximately us for its sybil ives division which included hair care products such as permanent waves hair sprays hair coloring shampoos and conditioners watsco ran the professional hair care division consisting of sybil ives and winslow manufacturing inc until  in a profile on watsco in florida trend magazine october  the company’s sales and earnings throughout the s were characterized as “unspectacular” the company in many ways fit the model of the corporate conglomerate that dominated that era with operations spread across several market segments—hair care and air conditioning could hardly be more different the company came under the control of a new leader in december  albert h nahmad when he acquired a controlling interest in the company from its founder william wagner he became chairman president and chief executive officer and eventually took the company in a new direction nahmad had a background both in business and in engineering he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the university of new mexico and a master of science degree in industrial administration from purdue university he then worked for several years for the conglomerate wr grace  co and for the accounting firm arthur young  co now known as ernst  young for several years under nahmad’s leadership at watsco things did not look too different the company continued to pick up smaller manufacturing firms including del mar engineering co in  rho sigma inc in  and camstat inc of los angeles in  the company sold its professional hair care division in  for us nearly twice what it had paid for the clairol division five years earlier in addition nahmad made several moves to strengthen watsco’s operations in  watsco’s los angelesbased subsidiaries del mar engineering and rho sigma moved to hialeah where they became part of the production enterprises division in  another california subsidiary camstat also moved to hialeah so that watsco’s operations were not so farflung the company also made a significant investment in  buying an approximate  interest in florida commercial banks inc a bank holding company for approximately us million two years later watsco sold its interest in the bank for approximately us million beginning to move in the sedit by the mids watsco’s revenues had grown to approximately us million watsco’s air conditioning business was doing well the us sun belt had seen a boom in housing in the s as many people migrated south and watsco continued to thrive even as the boom flattened because it sold replacement parts air conditioners used almost yearround in the sun belt usually wore out within – years so the replacement cycle was in full swing in the s even as new home construction slowed by  nahmad was anxious to expand watsco which had considerable cash to invest nahmad made it known that he was looking for acquisitions and even took out an advertisement in the wall street journal asking people with companies to sell to contact him then watsco took an unexpected step its first major acquisition of the mids was not related to its air conditioning business any more than hair care had been in may  watsco acquired a temporary help and permanent placement services firm called dunhill personnel system inc dunhill had revenue of roughly us million annually and personnel services was expected to be a high growth business nahmad first announced that he would spin off the division for a profit within a few years but dunhill continued to be a part of watsco through  when it was sold to ats group llc in  watsco revenues reached us million   entry into hvac distributionedit the real key to watsco’s growth and the foundation that would be built upon thereafter came in  when watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business in  watsco bought  of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the rheem brand name gemaire distributors inc for us million the other  of the company was held by rheem then in  watsco bought a  interest in heating  cooling supply inc the largest independent distributor of hvac equipment and supplies in california watsco had planned to buy  of heating  cooling supply raising money through a public stock offering iraqs invasion of kuwait and the possibility of war in the persian gulf flattened the stock market making watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible and the company withdrew it instead watsco settled for a smaller piece of heating  cooling supply paying approximately us million for a  interest rheem bought the remaining  the acquisition allowed watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern california and arizona and company revenues shot up by  watsco’s revenues had reached us million steady growth in the sedit a longterm replacement cycle was underway in the sun belt for central air conditioners following the housing boom in the sun belt during the s watsco also grew by expanding into new highgrowth markets it opened a location in las vegas in  anticipating vigorous population growth there the company also benefited from the rebuilding effort in the wake of hurricane andrew the hurricane devastated southern florida in  and in miamidade county alone about  homes were destroyed and more than  others were damaged as watsco’s distribution business took off its manufacturing business became a smaller portion of its total business by  about three quarters of the company’s revenues came from distribution manufacturing was profitable and watsco began manufacturing electronic temperature controls which it sold to oems watsco also began making a new product in  which it called the flash the flash was a machine that captured and filtered chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the coolant commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration equipment the flash was manufactured by a watsco subsidiary in hialeah and it was important because the clean air act enacted in july  prohibited the release of cfcs into the air the flash made it possible for air conditioning contractors to recover and recycle cfcs in compliance with the law with this new product watsco hoped that its manufacturing business would equal the distribution side by the end of the decade but it was the distribution business that continued to lead the way through the s the industry was still highly fragmented made up of many small wellestablished players and watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition “there’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us” ceo nahmad told the wall street journal june   in that interview nahmad also announced that watscos profit for  was expected to go up by about  the company moved to the more prestigious new york stock exchange that year in  watsco acquired central air conditioning distributors inc a north carolina rheem distributor in  watsco bought out rheem’s minority interest in the three rheembrand distributors  gemaire  heating  cooling supply and  comfort supply a  acquisition that they had split  these all became wholly owned subsidiaries of watsco the company also bought three states supply company inc that year then in early  watsco acquired coastline distribution inc and purchased four

comfortmaker and arcoaire it had  locations of its coastline distribution business spread throughout florida georgia alabama the carolinas maryland and parts of southern california within a couple months watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker carrier this was the companys th acquisition in the hvacr distribution business since  with the distribution business growing so quickly watsco decided to sell off its manufacturing business in january  the company announced its intention to focus solely on its distribution business which generated approximately  of total revenues in  it sold its manufacturing subsidiary watsco components inc to international comfort products corporation in  watsco continued to acquire smaller distributors in  buying a georgia firm that distributed heaters and air conditioners to the mobile home industry kaufman supply inc had annual revenues of us million and looked to have a lucrative niche in the thriving mobile home market in the southeast us by the late s watsco had become a billiondollar company it had made significant inroads into the hvacr distribution market in florida texas and california key sun belt states in  the company announced that it was ready to move into new england which was new territory for watsco new england was served by some  different distributors and the total market for heating and cooling including parts and supplies was estimated to be worth more than us million in  watsco bought two major distributors in the northeast homans associates inc and heat inc and declared that it was actively looking for more acquisitions in the area watsco finished  with  distribution locations in its network and record growth revenues grew  to us billion watsco was now the largest independent distributor of residential heating and cooling equipment in the us improved operating efficiencies and continued growth in the sedit in  the company entered another mode concentrating on improving operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations instead of focusing on growth through acquisitions it announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations  locations closed in  and  closed in  and the integration of operating subsidiaries which resulted in a more simplified operating structure the company looked for other ways to cut costs too it restructured the business it had bought from kaufman supply which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing watsco also invested in new technology in the early s by introducing acdoctorcom a consumerfriendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning including information on energy efficiency product comparisons and tax and utility credits as well as a way to find a licensed hvac contractor to service their repair and replacement needs watsco reported sales of us billion in  up slightly from the previous year revenues for  shrank slightly yet watsco still saw opportunities for future growth in the hvacr distribution market company analysts perceived the hvacr distribution industry as undercapitalized and fragmented suggesting there was still a place for a wellheeled consolidator watsco continued its acquisition strategy in the s acquiring a number of other businesses including  locations from a former competitor pameco in  it also acquired goodman manufacturing’s largest distributor east coast metal distributors inc in  with  locations in the southeast east coast had been owned by the same family for more than  years watsco then

marketsedit watsco’s strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth higher margin replacement market in which customers generally demand immediate convenient and reliable service the company responds to this need by i offering a broad range of product lines including the necessary equipment parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system ii maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience iii maintaining wellstocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner iv providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and v developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities the company believes these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller lesscapitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations implement technological business solutions provide the same range of products maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering in some geographic areas watsco believes it has a competitive advantage over factoryoperated distributor networks that typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as watsco’s and which have fewer warehouse locations than they do which makes it more difficult for these competitors to meet the timesensitive demands of the replacement market in addition to the replacement market watsco sells to the new construction market including new homes and commercial construction the company believes its reputation for reliable highquality service and relationships with contractors who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets allow them to compete effectively in these markets acquisition strategyedit the company focuses on acquiring businesses that either complement its current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets since  watsco has acquired  hvacr distribution businesses six of which operate as primary operating subsidiaries the other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of the primary operating subsidiaries through a combination of sales and market share growth opening of new locations tuckin acquisitions expansion of product lines improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership the company has produced substantial sales and earnings growth postacquisition watsco continues to pursue additional strategic acquisitions andor joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets operating philosophyedit acquired subsidiaries operate in a manner that builds upon the longterm relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers typically watsco seeks to maintain the identity and culture of acquired businesses by retaining their historical trade names management teams and sales organizations and by continuing their product brandname offerings watsco believes this strategy allows the company to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies watsco maintains a specialized staff at its corporate headquarters in miami florida that provides functional support for the subsidiaries’ growth strategies in their respective markets certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies productsedit watsco sells an expansive line of products and maintains a diverse mix of inventory to meet its customers’ immediate needs and seeks to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner furnace or refrigeration system on short notice the cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons one ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to  british thermal units btus and is generally adequate to air condition approximately  square feet of residential space the products the company distributes consist of i equipment including residential central air conditioners ranging

copper tubing concrete pads tape adhesives and other ancillary supplies the refrigeration products watsco distributes include condensing units compressors evaporators valves refrigerant walkin coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications distribution and salesedit the largest market watsco serves is the us in which the most significant markets for hvacr products are in the sun belt accordingly the majority of watsco’s distribution locations are in the sun belt with the highest concentration in florida and texas these markets have been a strategic focus of the company given their size the reliance by homeowners and businesses on hvacr products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last  years which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of hvacr equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency in the us cooling and heating accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical home key suppliersedit watsco has significant relationships with carrier rheem goodman nordyne emerson manitowoc honeywell owens corning johns manville and dupont each of which is a leading manufacturer of hvacr products in the us each manufacturer has a wellestablished reputation of producing highquality competitively priced products the manufacturers’ current product offerings quality serviceability and brandname recognition
