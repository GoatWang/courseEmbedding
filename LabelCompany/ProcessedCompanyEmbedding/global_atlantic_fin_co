mistreat employees inflated egos and too much power has created an unhealthy environment for anyone looking to grow their career or perform to their full capacity there is a definite inner circle that you will not be able to get in to in fact you are purposely excluded from events and projects or if you were on a project you are routinely phased out of it so that the managers can receive the glory associated with a job well done i experienced more than one occasion where i was intentionally left out of meetings on projects i had been working onother consexpressly forbidden from speaking to upper management criticized for providing honest diplomatic feedback about a project retaliated against for being ill given menial projects when requesting more work because i had capacity while managers complained to everyone who would listen about how busy they werethe culture is horrible you are made fun of discriminated against and harassed albeit quietly sometimes and more overtly at other timesi have never reviewed a former company before but feel so strongly that global atlantic is headed in the wrong direction and opening themselves up to countless lawsuits with the way management speaks to employees  with zero concern for hr rules and regulations that i had to postadvice to managementstop thinking you are the be allend all of management you have smart people working
