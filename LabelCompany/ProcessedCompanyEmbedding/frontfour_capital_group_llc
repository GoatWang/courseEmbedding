accretive and that a combination would create more value than either company could achieve on a standalone basisurges ilg to retain financial and legal advisors to assist with evaluation and execution of a transaction news provided by frontfour capital group llc may    et share this article greenwich conn may   prnewswire  frontfour capital group llc together with its affiliates frontfour a significant stockholder of ilg inc ilg or the company nasdaq ilg today announced it has delivered a letter to the board of directors of ilg calling upon the company to seek a business combination with marriott vacations worldwide corporation marriott vacations  frontfour believes there is tremendous industrial logic for ilg and marriott vacations to merge and at a meaningful premium to the current stock price the transaction would still be highly accretive financially while also yielding a number of qualitative synergies  the text of the letter is reprinted below may   mr craig m nashchairman president and ceoilg inc sunset drivemiami fl  cc the board of directors ilg inc dear craig thank you for taking the time to meet with us last week  as discussed frontfour capital group llc together with its affiliates frontfour is currently a significant shareholder of ilg inc ilg or the company with total shareholdings and equivalents of approximately  million shares representing over  of ilgs total shares outstanding  as we discussed we believe that the publicly traded timeshare companies have been one of the most misunderstood opportunities in the leisure industry despite strong fundamentals growth prospects and the favorable secular shifts in leisure travel  we were particularly attracted to ilg given its valuation growth profile and free cash flow opportunity  in addition there is a significant opportunity to unlock value for shareholders at ilg through the pursuit of a strategic combination with marriott vacations worldwide corporation marriott vacations we appreciate the recent dialogue that we have had with you and certain members of the board of directors the board  however we continue to have significant concerns related to i the cumbersome size of the companys member board which is suboptimal ii your stated appetite for incremental acquisitions despite not yet having fully integrated the vistana acquisition from starwood hotels and resorts starwood from may  iii the companys questionable capital allocation policy and the boards view of ilgs intrinsic value in light of only  million in repurchases during the first quarter of  despite highly accretive trading levels iv the companys position that safe harbor in a reverse morris trust transaction rmt requires that total share repurchases are limited to  of total outstanding for a period of two years in contrast to the opinion held by leading tax experts v the general perception held by many investors that the company is using the tax matters agreement associated with the reverse morris trust transaction as a poison pill despite ilgs strong standalone prospects we believe that significant shareholder value can be created through the exploration and completion of a business combination with marriott vacations  there is tremendous industrial logic for ilg and marriott vacations to merge  at a meaningful premium to the current stock price the transaction would still be highly financially accretive while also yielding a number of qualitative synergies through the integration of the vistana and marriott vacations sales  marketing functions given marriott internationals marriott ownership of the respective hotel flags as well as the elimination of duplicative corporate ga  as we discussed we have a long history investing in the timeshare industry  we were a significant holder of diamond resorts international diamond and in october  sent a public letter to diamond asking them to seek strategic alternatives prior to their sale in   given our experience in studying diamonds successful strategy of executing on a number of acquisitions of nonhotel affiliated properties the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate ga and sales  marketing expenses is not lost on us  the opportunity here is even more compelling on the back of the merger between marriott and starwood given the strength of both loyalty programs and the ability to seamlessly work with the pro forma marriott to expand and grow the timeshare business as one while we write this letter to you and the board we have also made this letter public as we believe that our views are shared by the broader investor and analyst community  we are confident that a financially accretive transaction would be well received not only by ilg shareholders but also marriott vacations shareholders  we believe this to be the case as marriott vacations stock has appreciated subsequent to public comments during their recent q earnings conference call where they indicated a desire to not be investmentgrade rated and their readiness to take financial leverage to approximately x debt  ebitda for the right transaction  from our perspective it is crystal clear that this is the right transaction  accordingly we urge the board to immediately retain both legal and financial advisors to assist in the evaluation of a transaction with marriott vacations  moreover we were happy to hear from both yourself as well as other directors that you are not afraid of and would consider a deal at the right price   we believe that a strategic combination with marriott vacations would result in i a significant premium to ilg shareholders while maintaining equity upside exposure in the pro forma company as the consideration would be a mix of cashstock ii the creation of the preeminent and global leading timeshare operator of upperupscale vacation ownership brands with access to marriotts consolidated loyalty rewards program   iii significant cost savings due to duplicative finance it legal and sales  marketing functions amongst the vistana and marriott vacations vacation ownership businesses iv the ability to leverage the newly opened sales centers in pulling forward the monetization of both ilg and marriott vacations extensive completed and inprocess inventory v the extinguishment of potential conflicts associated with marriotts intention to combine the marriott rewards program with starwoods preferred guest loyalty program spg by the end of  vi the creation of a complementary and unparalleled product portfolio enhancing the value proposition to existing timeshare owners vii lastly a key part of the  ilg business model is the exchange and rental segment which offers alternative vacation accommodations and options to its  million exchange members who are either associated with private developers or other larger timeshare operators  through a monthly fee either paid individually or through annual maintenance fees individuals can effectively trade in their pointsweeks to access this exchange network called interval international which encompasses over  resorts in this segment ilg has approximately  corporate exchange members whose annual fees are paid by their respective timeshare operator from their annual dues  this is lower margin as ilg has less direct customer contact and therefore less of an ability to control the process and upsell  over the years this corporate exchange portion has experienced headwinds due to industry consolidation as well as the larger timeshare operators trying to reduce the annual fees paid so they can capture a larger spread  through the vistana acquisition ilg was able to bring approximately  of its corporate exchange members inhouse which effectively provides insulation against potential future headwinds  a combination with marriott vacations would significantly further increase inhouse corporate exchange members providing additional stability to this business  we believe that a transaction with marriott vacations can be structured through a combination of cash and stock that delivers a sizeable premium to ilg shareholders while allowing all remaining shareholders to participate in the equity upside of the pro forma entity  below is an illustrative and conservative analysis assuming that ilg enters into a transaction between  –  per share  such a premium would represent close to  upside at the midpoint of the range from where ilg stock traded during the first quarter of    additionally we note that over the last year there has been virtually no insider buying despite the stock trading at significantly lower levels our conservative analysis below assumes total cost synergies of  million no revenue synergies assumes only mm of synergies included in the leverage calculation and excludes nonrecourse securitized debt a  cost of debt financing  million in cash transaction expenses and is derived using current  consensus street estimates for revenue and ebitda  as shown in the table below and assuming the midpoint of the offer range and leverage range and further taking into account our conservative assumptions as discussed above a transaction is nearly  accretive to marriott vacations shareholders based on current  eps estimates  e marriott vacations pf eps accretion sensitivity  gross debt  ebitda x x x x x          ilg          offer          price                                       in summary we believe that a significant opportunity exists to unlock value for all shareholders  we reiterate our belief that a significant percentage of the shareholder base is supportive of a transaction and urge management and the board to fully explore a business combination with marriott vacations  we are longterm and typically passive investors however to the extent that no action is taken we will review all of our options including but not limited to taking action at ilgs  annual meeting sincerely s zachary r george          s david a lorber          s stephen e
