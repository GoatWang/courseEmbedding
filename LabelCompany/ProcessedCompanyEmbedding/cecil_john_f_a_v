board of directors  directors  john fav cecil biography jack cecil is a creative dyslexic while it takes jack more time to process the written language this condition doesn’t slow him down the greatgrandson of george w vanderbilt is the president and ceo of biltmore farms which was one of the southeast’s largest dairy producers and has now evolved into a community development firm biltmore farms is the developer of biltmore park town square a mixeduse urban center of retail office restaurants hospitality and entertainment venues as the fourth generation to run the family business he is committed to building strong communities  “i connect dots that most people don’t see” jack explains he has a way of identifying the big picture even in the face of adversity for example during the great recession the company stuck with its plan to construct town square even though many of the storefronts were not leased now it’s  percent full for biltmore farms the five tenets of community development of education health care economic development arts  culture and environmental stewardship drive everything the company does “we have built a downtown but need to add more jobs” he says “we need the complementary employment base” for decades jack has been focused on creating a western version of rtp which would include a combination of advanced manufacturing jobs innovative and entrepreneurial firms plus applied technology businesses he sees asheville’s vibrant arts and creative talents as a strong attraction for people and companies to consider the place that inspired literary giant thomas wolfe research triangle park is dealing with the reverse “the park has a plethora of research jobs and bob geolas is creating the downtown complete with creative spaces” he says jack and rtp have a fascinating history he recalls as a sophomore in college during the mid’s visiting with archie davis one of the cofounders of the park when mr davis was earning his master’s degree from uncchapel hill ten years later he had lunch with mr davis in old salem to learn more about his vision and execution of rtp jack was intrigued with the linkage between the universities the public sector and private enterprise to the success of the park  seeking more information about research parks jack also met with retired first union banker cliff cameron who spearheaded the development of university research park associated with unccharlotte the advice he gleaned from those two great north carolinians helped the company formulate the plans to construct town square and the adjoining corporate research campus but jack knows the success of western north carolina is connected to rtp and raleigh he serves on several boards including as vicechair of the nc biotechnology center chair of the institute for emerging issues at nc state university and past member of the unc board of governors and the nc economic development board george briggs the executive director of nc arboretum and jack normally ride from asheville together to attend nc biotechnology center board meetings  “he’s a great friend and mentor” and “a model of citizenship” he observed that jack travels with green markers to highlight documents he’s reading because of his dyslexia he’s always prepared and well informed “he’s one of those people we all want to emulate” mr brigg says “whenever i talk to him jack is always leaning toward the possible” during those four and halfhour trips mr briggs has observed jack taking a call from the governor and a few minutes later chatting with his wife or advising one of their four sons on their crew races or baseball games “the magnitude of community service jack carries routinely would crumple the knees of most people” mr briggs says  jack inherited this commitment to civic responsibility for the state from his father george hv cecil who during his business career served on numerous university state government and private sector boards “the real motivator for me is trying to grow the incomes of the people of western north carolina” jack articulates “you do it by improving the education system providing quality health care and offering people the opportunity for appropriate jobs so they may raise their family what’s happening in the triangle triad and metrolina is tantamount to promote healthy growth in western north carolina so i do all i can to support that” bfhg ii llc north carolina  cecil john fav  business profiles business profile document delivery api about      companies  officers home     north carolina      bfhg ii llc
