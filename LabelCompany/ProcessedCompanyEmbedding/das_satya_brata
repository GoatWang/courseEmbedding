with live orchestra was performed by natyam ensemble choreographed by malavika venkatsubbaiah at thousand faces festival on may  and  alberta avenue community centre edmonton canada in the iage of iphones and ipads and ieverything it is deeply satisfying to be reminded that ihumans are connected by more than technology as the hindu tradition has it we are part of an animating force that we cannot imagine yet which enables us to imagine the force we cannot see yet which enables us to see the force which gives us the capacity to move beyond the limits of ego to a deeper connection with the mystery of our own creation hindu philosophy names this force shakti empowerment the primordial cosmic energy that animates everything the energy behind the cycle of destruction creation and sustenance reflected in many human traditions as the divine mother feminine power the mother goddess as diana isis guanyin tara venus athena the virgin mary the hindu concept of shakti is a feminine energy that takes all that is inanimate and brings it to life maha devi the great goddess who gives both agency and purpose to the triune of creatorsustainerdissolver brahmavishnushiva in the fourth canto of hymns in praise of the goddess devi mahatma the maha devi is described as the impelling spirit within every atom who spreads the universe before her and pervades it sarvasrayaakhilam idam jagadangsabhutam  avyakrita hi parama prakritistvamaadyaayet she remains illusory beyond the understanding of even the gods of the triune hence she is mahamaya or the grand illusion the allegory is that the human life of the iworld is itself an illusion in the ferocious cosmic swirl iness and ego are the fixed point of reference which enables us to ground ourselves in the belief of autonomous individual existence to rise beyond to achieve a greater understanding of who we are and why we are the devis shakti enables us to overcome the demons of our own nature the demons within us all to seek a higher calling thus the maha devi becomes the vessel and the refuge for our journey across lifes difficult ocean in natyam dance academys mahamaya artistic director malavika venkatsubbaiah leavens this dense philosophy in a dazzling swirl of colour and movement imbued with power and grace tableaux lasting an instant before dissolving into the next in a skilled ensemble of seven that dances as one mahamaya is a spellbinding work in which one enters with senses awakened being in the moment without ever wanting to leave it it brings alive the potential for the classical indian dance form bharatanatya to be presented as a swift yet evanescent spectacle breathtaking images that fade so swiftly even as they remain in the minds eyethe rhythmic slapping of feet on the hard floor to the beat of the drum energetic and intricate mridanga by talented curtis andrews a particularly lyrical violin by kaushik shivaramakrishnan and the hypnotic hymns of the orchestras soulful vocalist maha narasimhan and nattuvanga by dr kanchana sivalingam all bring a full engagement of the senses as practised so ably by malavika in her career as a solo dancer bharatanatya has a particular grace dictated by its prescribed postures and gestures a strict lyricism and a pace that allows the audience to remark on the subtlety of facial expression and hand gestures performed in a dance drama format in a swiftly paced ensemble the effects become amplified and multiplied until one stops watching and simply surrenders to the experience the two narrative themes of mahamaya were the killing of the demons raktabija bloodseed the selfperpetuating monster that is an allegory for insatiable desire and mahishasura the great demon an allegory for the human ego and the illusion of attachment to material objects it is testament of malavikas evolution as a dancer that her mastery of facial expressions and hand gestures seems completely effortless she evokes the presence of the great goddess in both benign and terrifying forms radiating ferocity then transforming to serenity with a particularly compelling evocation of the goddess vanquishing the stream of desires by lapping up the blood of raktabija and liberating mahishasura with a decisive spear thrust to release his captive soul from its buffaloheaded body there is a particular grace and fluidity in the ensembles rendition of the hymn to the cosmic dance of the goddess durga tandava stotram in which the slayer of the demon mahisha strides supreme across the universe the expressions of the ensemble remain serenely blissful even as they move with sweatinducing energy through a dizzying array of steps and formations without any sign of breaking a sweat this is where malavikas skills as a choreographer truly shine among the exceptional performances of a talented and flawlessly united ensemble abigail seewalds expression of the serene face saumyabadana of the goddess is worthy of kudos the talented ensemble consisted of abigail seewald visesha murthy hasha sasitharan jacqueline karatha as raktabija shivangi nagarajan as mahisha malavika venkatsubbaiah as mahamaya mahamaya takes bharatanatya to a new dimension blending lyrical beauty with a breathtaking athleticism offering both a meditation and a blessing it is malavika venkatsubbaiahs most polished and evocative work to date transcending the particularity of its origins to present a vivid and deeply moving evocation of the forces that bind us satya brata das is a writer and community volunteer who most recently served as chair of the edmonton heritage

answers to this complex problem from multidisciplinary perspectives this volume maintains that the question concerning the sense of existence and its destruction is essentially tied up with the question of violence violence as a radical destruction of sense for and of existence the contributors to this volume look into the ways in which violence derives legitimacy in the world primarily through language and religion each essay negotiates with the politics of this legitimacy in a highly individual and irreducibly singular way going beyond the familiar model of questioning the

never come to pass it is this coming this incalculable future which is inextricably connected to our mortality that is the concern in this work what is renewed here is the thought of a pure future beyond all that is given and outside of any immanence of selfpresence it is the thought of a promise of time that opens us on the basis of an irreducible mortality to the advent of redemptive messianic future which is incalculable along the lines of heidegger’s notion of ‘phenomenology of the inapparent’ as a point of departure and taking inspiration from thinkers like schelling rosenzweig and walter benjamin this work attempts to work towards a phenomenology of promise that—no longer founding upon eidetic consciousness—takes its bearing from our exposure to the excess of an immemorial promise and its unforeseen fulfilment that arrives from an eternal remnant of time beyond all ‘end’ and all ‘completion’ in this manner this work argues that the highest ethicopolitical task of our time is to keep our human condition open for the immemorial promise and redemptive messianic fulfilment beyond closures of all sorts and to welcome what is always to come without reducing it to various immanent politics of selfconsumption this demands the work of deconstruction of the metaphysical foundation of a historical reason in order to open it up to the messianic affirmation of the event of future this work contributes in a significant and original manner to the growing and upcoming interdisciplinary studies that combine philosophical thinking from a certain deconstructivephenomenological perspective with theologicalpolitical studies added to insights drawn from the place of language from contemporary philosophers like jean luc nancy phillippe lacoue

destruction is essentially tied up with the question of violence violence as a radical destruction of sense for and of existence the contributors to this volume look into the ways in which violence derives legitimacy in the world primarily through language and religion each essay negotiates with the politics of this legitimacy in a highly individual and irreducibly singular way going beyond the familiar model of questioning the contributors argue that the place of violence in our contemporary historical condition has accelerated to an ever immeasurable state and demands urgent responses from intellectuals and activists alike religion philosophy violence and messianism  bookmark  download  more  editview impact  readers    mentions  the wounded world essays on ethics and politics

that will never come to pass it is this coming this incalculable future which is inextricably connected to our mortality that is the concern in this work what is renewed here is the  more abstractto come to come into existence that will never come to pass it is this coming this incalculable future which is inextricably connected to our mortality that is the concern in this work what is renewed here is the thought of a pure future beyond all that is given and outside of any immanence of selfpresence it is the thought of a promise of time that opens us on the basis of an irreducible mortality to the advent of redemptive messianic future which is incalculable along the lines of heidegger’s notion of ‘phenomenology of the inapparent’ as a point of departure and taking inspiration from thinkers like schelling rosenzweig and walter benjamin this work attempts to work towards a phenomenology of promise that—no longer founding upon eidetic consciousness—takes its bearing from our exposure to the excess of an immemorial promise and its unforeseen fulfilment that arrives from an eternal remnant of time beyond all ‘end’ and all ‘completion’ in this manner this work argues that the highest ethicopolitical task of our time is to keep our human condition open for the immemorial promise and redemptive messianic fulfilment beyond closures of all sorts and to welcome what is always to come without reducing it to various immanent politics of selfconsumption this demands the work of deconstruction of the metaphysical foundation of a historical reason in order to open it up to the messianic affirmation of the event of future this work contributes in a significant and original manner to the growing and upcoming interdisciplinary studies that combine philosophical thinking from a certain deconstructivephenomenological perspective with theologicalpolitical studies added to insights drawn from the place of language from contemporary philosophers like jean luc nancy phillippe lacoue labarthe and jean louis chrétien   bookmark  download  more  editview impact  readers    mentions  at jnu all that is beautiful and solid has melted into the air

other than happiness itself this happiness however can be attained ther more abstract can happiness be based on the plane of the worldhistorical reason if the task of the worldhistorical politics of the profane order is none other than happiness itself this happiness however can be attained there only at the price of singularity as a result happiness in true sense can never be the conditio sine qua non for the worldhistorical reason a conditio which is the passion of singularity par excellence only for the singulars beatitudo can be the eternal passion of existence in other words singularity essentially is this passion and none but that only such singularity can open itself to true universality not as a particular mode of given being but as existence which is first of all exposed to itself through such an eternal passion conditio sine qua non taking kierkegaard’s works as main reference point this paper argues that the singular notion of beatitudo beatitudo itself is an idea of singularity in its irreducibility to the historical reason and to any theodicy of history is essentially an eschatological opening of history to the true conditio sine qua non beatitudo understood thus is the unconditional and absolute demand of the mortals that can only arrive as a gift that marks everything that is “human” with the mark of nonautarchy and nonautochthony nothing of the worldhistorical politics therefore raises itself to the arrival of beatitudo  but only as the eschatological suspension of its law and abandonment  gelassenheit an idea from meister eckhart of all
