share this page continue reading the main story a priest and former pillar of the roman catholic church in new york experienced an extraordinary downfall yesterday as a judge sentenced him to four years in prison for stealing tens of thousands of dollars from his parish on the affluent upper east sideto avoid trial the priest msgr john g woolsey  admitted to stealing more than  from parish funds at his former church st john the martyr and using it to finance a lifestyle more in keeping with that of a corporate ceo including golf outings the purchase of expensive watches and cosmetic dental workhis lawyer said he had bought or traded as many as  or  watches and called his thieving “compulsive repetitive and irrational” and obviously the product of a disturbed mindbut prosecutors contend that he took advantage of the good will and trust of his parishioners including some elderly church members to steal more than  over seven years and that another  is inexplicably missing from church bank accounts advertisement continue reading the main story “you should know that across the street in criminal court people who steal cans of tuna fish wind up going to jail for  days or  days” justice bruce allen of state supreme court in manhattan told monsignor woolsey at yesterday’s hearing continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story wearing a tie and shirtsleeves justice allen stood up and leaned over his bench in a gesture of intimacy as he looked the priest in the eye smiling slightly and told him that he had considered the option of giving him no jail time at all as the defense lawyer had asked“but i’ll tell you right now i’m not going to do that” the judge saidjustice allen said he had been touched by the more than  “letters from the heart” from monsignor woolsey’s supporters and in light of those was cutting a year off the promised sentence of no more than five years he sentenced the priest to one to four years in prison and  in restitution in addition to  that the priest had already paidmonsignor woolsey is the only priest in the new york archdiocese to have been convicted of financial crimes in at least two decades and maybe much longer although three have been convicted of sex offenses joseph zwilling a spokesman for the archdiocese saidmonsignor woolsey was visibly stunned to be sentenced to jail rather than community service and he was unable to stand up for a few minutes his lawyer nicholas defeis leaned over and hugged him then monsignor woolsey rose unsteadily to his feet and was placed in handcuffs by court officers photo msgr john g woolsey admitted stealing from his church for seven years to finance a lavish lifestyle credit don hogan charlesthe new york times he recovered his composure enough to turn and offer a professional smile of the kind a priest or psychiatrist might hone during years of counseling to about  supporters in the court pews some of whom had tears streaming down their cheekshe is eligible for work release immediately his lawyer said and for probation after a year cardinal edward m egan the archbishop of new york said yesterday in a statement that he prayed that the sentencing would mark “a new beginning for all who may have been hurt” by the monsignor’s actionson tuesday the cardinal had submitted a measured letter to the court saying his purpose was not to “address the underlying crimes” but to provide an account of monsignor woolsey’s good works previously newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking

main story he spent more time however discussing how it had felt to be at the center of a public scandal than expressing remorse “i have felt the sting of comments when i was down” he said as a result he said he would be “more conscious of someone who is down”he compared himself to moses invoking a scriptural story in which moses is tired of standing and praying and two of his followers “come along and hold each arm”he was grateful he said to his supporters for sticking with himthe prosecutor matthew amatruda said monsignor woolsey had abused the trust of parishioners by telling them he was spending their donations on church repairs and good works when in fact he was spending it on his lavish lifestylethe archdiocese began investigating in  when the family of an elderly parishioner who has since died accused him of manipulating her into giving him  in cash and stocksexactly how much money he stole was hotly debated for nearly an hour yesterday by the defense and prosecution lawyers ultimately justice allen agreed to state for the record that the monsignor “allegedly” stole more than  the amount could be important lawyers said in determining how much time he spends in jail before being releasedmonsignor woolsey was ordained in  after completing st joseph seminary in yonkers and assigned to st margaret of antioch parish in pearl river ny he was admired for inspirational
