data security provider continues to deliver and investors are finally taking notice tim brugger timbrugger may   at pm with check point software nasdaqchkp bumping up against its week high following a strong earnings release some investors may wonder if its too late to enjoy the run but for longterm investors it looks like theres plenty of growth ahead of the company particularly because of ceo gil shweds leadership and how management has gone about building the business over the past couple of years as one of check points competitors palo alto networks nysepanw has demonstrated check points slow but steady approach to its business model isnt as easy to deliver on as one may think  a data security interface image source check point slow and steady unlike many of its peers check point software doesnt post ridiculously high yearoveryear revenue gains while palo alto was reporting plus sales gains for nearly two years running due in part to its rampant spending on sales and marketing which at  million last quarter accounted for more than half its total revenue for some perspective check points salesrelated costs totaled just  million less than a quarter of its total revenue shwed made a committed effort to build check points business methodically by focusing on its recurring revenue foundation via its subscriptionbased model and managing overhead and hes delivering though palo alto has performed admirably in building its own subscription revenue and became analyst favorites check point was delivering what many others werent steadily increasing profits one reason is last quarter check points sales and marketing  costs rose  yearoveryear while palo alto networks salesrelated costs jumped   recurring sales should result in minimal increases in sales costs and steady bottomline growth as is the case with check point but palo alto continues to spend negatively impacting its own increasing subscription sales check point reported  million in revenue last quarter an  jump compared to a year ago about par for the course thanks to the combination of its sound expense management and the growth of check points recurring revenue subscription sales earnings per share increased  to  palo alto its pershare loss increased to  from last years  a share check points enjoying the benefit of its lowcost recurring revenue model while the palo altos of the world continue struggling to overcome costs minimizing the benefits of an ongoing revenue model check points subscription revenue still doesnt equal that of its product and license sales but the gap is narrowing with each passing quarter product and license sales equaled  million last quarter up  over last year software subscription revenue contributed  million to check points sales a stellar  improvement the balance of check points revenue  million was derived from software updates and maintenance which should also continue climbing given its software subscription emphasis the result of shweds recurringrevenue focus is it helps keep expenses to a minimum assuming its executing which check point is because over time it costs less to service existing customers than to continually drum up more product sales yin and yang the systematic approach to growth check point has opted for doesnt warrant a lot of hoopla its just a reliable steady process that investors can rely on for years to come while palo alto is enduring the inevitable slowing of topline growth yet is still spending indiscriminately check point keeps chugging along the more conservative path check point has chosen is proving worthwhile as more pundits and investors take notice of what shwed and team are doing shareholders are reaping the rewards to the tune of a  jump in value this year at the other end of the spectrum are providers such as palo alto now that palo alto is no longer an analyst darling because of its continually slowing sales growth its shares are down  this year yes check point stock is flying high but the manner in which its finally won over investors is highly sustainable so theres no reason to think it will change anytime soon in fact at the midrange of check points revenue guidance of  million to  million for this quarter investors can expect its usual  yearoveryear improvement check point has forecast pershare earnings excluding onetime items of  to  a share which would be a  increase over last years   considering its increasing quarterly profits and expectations for more its conservative expense management and a position in an industry thats expected to

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
