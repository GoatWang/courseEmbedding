lowcarbon ethanol our destination model and stateoftheart production practices allow us to produce ethanol that reduces carbon dioxide emissions by  percent compared to conventional gasoline in addition pacific ethanol is working to identify and develop other renewable fuel technologies such as cellulosebased ethanol production and biodiesel in order to meet demand for lowcarbon ethanol pacific ethanol is constructing over  million gallons of capacity by  in strategic locations across the west central to our growth strategy is our destination business model whereby each respective ethanol plant achieves lower process and transportation costs by servicing local markets for both fuel and feed providing us a strategic advantage in the marketplace ethanol is a critical part of the countrys energy future as an alternative fuel or a fuel additive it has many advantages ethanol is made from renewable resources reducing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming ethanol also helps consumers by increasing domestic fuel supplies and refining capacity the energy bill passed by congress in  requires an increase in ethanol use by refiners to

httpwwwpacificethanolnetsiteindexphpaboutfacilities kinergy marketing is the ethanol sales and distribution arm of pacific ethanol inc formerly an independent company founded by peis neil koehler kinergy continues to build on a strong customer base of major and unbranded oil companies since the demand for ethanol in the western united states exceeds the production capacity of existing and proposed ethanol plants in the region kinergy will continue to sell ethanol produced in the midwest in addition to pacific ethanols own production our expertise in transportation logistics and emphasis on superior service has led to close relationships with both suppliers and customers driven by the increasing demand for ethanol as well as the growing reputation of the company kinergys

process after a grains starch is converted to ethanol through fermentation the remaining nutrients including proteins fats fiber minerals and vitamins are concentrated into what is called wet distillers grain wdg wdg is a very palatable mediumprotein feed for dairy cattle beef cattle poultry and swine its high digestibility and energy content yield greater milk production and better feed conversions than other feeds beef cattle have shown faster and more efficient weight gains due to its digestibility energy content and palatability in the united states most distillers grains are produced in the midwest where producers dry the grains for shipping typically dried distillers grains have a lower nutritional content than wdg pacific ethanol is uniquely able to provide farmers with wet distillers grains because of our central locations in the heart of the livestock industry where there are more than enough head of livestock in a mile radius to consume all the wdg we can produce every day our distillers grain has the added advantage of being produced from just one type of grain as opposed to many of the midwest distillers grains which are made from corn milo barley or wheat depending on availability and pricing of competing crops this means that the nutrient content of our wdg is predictable and consistent this is particularly important for livestock producers where a subtle difference in the makeup of key feed ingredients can significantly affect production pacific ag products is the whollyowned subsidiary of pacific ethanol that handles the marketing and distribution of grain products for the company corn receiving and grain mill operations at front range energy in windsor colorado as well as all pacific ethanol plants are handled by pacific ag
