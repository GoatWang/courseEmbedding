about us  anellotech inc  cost competitive biosourced chemicals skip to main content renewable clean menu home about us cost competitive biosourced chemicals from clean nonfood biomass consumers are demanding products packaging and fuels produced from sustainable resources until now the chemical industry has never had a viable option of technology for producing  biobased basic dropin aromatic chemicals ie benzene toluene and xylenes btx due to the lack of efficient costcompetitive and scalable processes that utilize renewable nonfood biomass feedstocks anellotech’s new biotcattm process will make that option a reality about the company anellotech is a sustainable technology company focused on producing costcompetitive renewable chemicals from nonfood biomass – an unmet need for a very large addressable chemicals and fuels markets anellotech is developing an efficient and ecofriendly thermal catalytic process for converting nonfood biomass into aromatics these biobased products chemically identical to petroleumbased aromatics are used to make important plastics such as polyester polyethylene terephthalate or “pet” polystyrenes polycarbonates nylons and polyurethanes that ultimately are transformed into consumer goods such as beverage bottles food packaging clothing footwear carpeting automotive and electronic components and more anellotechs ultimate competitive advantage is its use of a onereactor catalytic process also by using renewable and readily available nonfood inputs such as wood corn stover and bagasse the biotcat™ process is less expensive than to processes relying on sugar as a feedstock and avoids competition with the food chain as a result these renewablesourced chemicals are expected to be produced and sold profitably against identical petroleumderived btx counterparts to accelerate development and drive costcompetitiveness anellotech’s worldclass rd team is jointly developing the biotcat process through indepth highly interactive longterm partnerships with leaders in process development catalysis engineering design and licensing anellotech’s strategic development licensing and funding partners include johnson matthey a global specialty chemicals company that offers products for a diverse range of industries and who is a major catalyst supplier to the process industries will codevelop and provide catalysts for the development program and will manufacture catalysts for commercial use ifp energies nouvelles ifpen the french public research entity will collaborate with anellotech throughout the process development program in addition to extensive activities at its rd center in lyon france ifpen has dedicated three fulltime senior engineers and technical experts to work at anellotech’s us location for two years during the startup of the tcat® development unit in  anellotech’s highly collaborative program leverages ifpen’s specific expertise in catalytic reactor modeling catalyst regenerator design and aromatics processing to provide additional depth and breadth of experience to the biotcat development program axens an international provider of licensed advanced technologies  of all refineries in the world have at least one axens technology license catalysts adsorbents and services has a global reputation for basic engineering design excellence and technology licensing leadership in the production of aromatics and is our partner for commercialization global licensing basic engineering design startup and technical support for licensees suntory one of the world’s leading consumer beverage companies has partnered with anellotech to advance the development and commercialization of costcompetitive bioaromatics including bioparaxylene the key component needed to make a  percent biobased pet beverage bottles the partnership an example of suntory’s commitment to sustainable business practices began in  under a collaboration agreement that has provided more than  million in funding to date toyota tsusho corporation is the toyota groups general trading company that develops diversified businesses through more than  consolidated companies in japan and overseas with customers around the world via a global network covering japan and more than  countries worldwide with various activities the group provides products and services in a broad range of business domains that are essential to achieving the creation of a prosperous and fulfilling society toyota tsusho corporation is listed in the tokyo stock exchange as well as in the nagoya stock exchange toyota tsusho announced publicly its investment in anellotech in july  anellotech’s new fullyintegrated development and testing facility “tcat” began commissioning on september st  this  metertall unit jointly designed with ifpen and using a catalyst jointly developed with johnson matthey will confirm the viability and suitability of the biotcat process for scaleup it will generate the data needed to design commercial plants planned for first commercial operations by the end of this decade after verification of the continuous operation of tcat suntory plans to move ahead with studies to consider the development of the first commercialscale biotcat plant to request a copy of an overview presentation about anellotech and the biotcat process please click on this link contact us share this technology  anellotech inc  cost competitive biosourced chemicals skip to main content renewable clean menu home technology new technology to produce clean renewable chemicals currently made from petroleum anellotechs core technology thermo catalytic biomass conversion biotcat™ for production of chemicals from renewable nonfood biomass is based on scientific research initially performed in professor george hubers laboratory at the university of massachusettsamherst and subsequent developments by anellotech biomass wood sawdust corn stover sugar cane bagasse byproduct and other nonfood materials is dried and ground the biomass is rapidly heated and the resulting gases are immediately converted into hydrocarbons by a proprietary reusable sandlike zeolite catalyst the resulting mixture of benzene toluene and xylenes biobtx which is identical to petroleumderived counterparts can be further purified and separated by using wellknown commercial technologies at either grassroots or existing petrochemical infrastructures competitive advantages process efficiency biotcat™ performs all process reactions in one fluid bed reactor where biomass is thermally broken down and then catalytically converted into btx this single step process uses a costeffective catalyst being jointly developed with johnson matthey to produce biobtx in commerciallyattractive yields by going directly from biomass to btx in one step anellotech does not make a highly oxygenated biooil intermediate products often seen in multistep pyrolysis processes and so avoids the need to add significant amounts of costly hydrogen in fact a process byproduct stream that we plan to burn to generate electricity could alternatively be converted to a renewable source of hydrogen via a watergas shift reactor longterm sustainability since the biotcat starts with biomass and generates the required process energy from the feedstock itself the bioaromatics products are manufactured with a very low carbonfootprint low cost economic competitiveness anellotechs ultimate competitive advantage is its use of a onereactor catalytic process also by using renewable and readily available nonfood materials such as wood corn stover and bagasse the biotcat process is less expensive compared to processes relying on sugar as a feedstock and avoids competition with the food chain as a result these renewablesourced chemicals are expected to be produced and sold profitably against identical petroleumderived btx counterparts patents the biotcat™ technology is covered under issued patents and filed
