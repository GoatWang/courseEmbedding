personalizes travel kim lyons  saturday april    pm courtesy of sara eklund traveler sara eklund took this photo of havana on a trip planned by viahero email newsletters sign up for one of our email newsletters lynne bangsund and her daughter krista wanted to go to cuba but they didnt want to go with the standard guided tour “we both speak a little spanish and we didnt really want to go with  other people” bangsund said so when they found travel site viahero during an online search they decided to give it a try they got a personalized itinerary prepared by a bona fide cuban guide for a fraction of the cost of a travel agent lynne said “it was amazing we had the entire trip planned” she said not only did they get to see sights they wouldnt otherwise have known about bangsund said the pair felt like they had an edge over other travelers as they made their way around havana they encountered other tourists at restaurants “they would be waiting but we had all our reservations planned ahead of time” when it launches in japan in may east libertybased travel startup viahero will add a third island country to its small but growing portfolio an alphalab alumni company viahero creates customized travel guides that allow travelers to experience their destination like a local rather than compensating the hotel or airline trying to sell the most expensive trip viahero relies on the person providing the expert advice the “heroes” if you will to create the best possible travel experience “people really value the local insight they wouldnt have access to otherwise” said viahero ceo greg buzulencia “youd have to go through thousands of reviews on a site like tripadvisor to get this depth of information” viahero has started small launching in cuba and iceland as its first markets the company uses a blend of airbnb hosts freelance tour guides and local travel writers many of whom come with their own audiences to help plan the trips for customers with cuba a relatively new destination for american travelers and iceland becoming a more popular destination because of lowcost airfares viahero has found a niche within the very crowded online travel space buzulencia says the typical customer for viahero is an experienced international traveler who might have visited a place with a tour guide in the past but wants a more authentic and independent experience how it works on the viahero website travelers choose what aspects of a trip are most important to them in a few categories food bakeries street food markets etc culture history museums art and activities outdoors beaches nightlife enter the number of days youll be visiting and choose a “hero” and youll get an estimate for how much your trip will cost an itinerary for a visit to cuba focused on bakeries beaches and history as planned by a local would be roughly  per day travelers pay separately for their airfare and lodging but the viahero itinerary offers flight times and recommendations for where to stay it also has details such as whether youll need reservations at recommended restaurants how much a taxi will cost and where to catch one and details that only a local or frequent visitor would know buzulencia says the company didnt plan to target islands but have found it easier as a startup to be able to focus on areas that are somewhat isolated geographically “for most people traveling to japan or to cuba thats usually their sole destination” he noted “its not like going to europe where people will want to plan visits to four different countries in one trip” but as the company grows buzulencia says he has his eye on future destinations chile colombia new zealand croatia and south korea among them “now that we have a process down we definitely want to try to diversify a little and be able to give our customers more variety” lynne bangsund never got to meet lianet the havana resident who planned her trip to cuba in person but says every night during their trip she and her daughter would toast to their “hero” and she says theres always the next trip “because now its like we have a friend in cuba to show us around” kim lyons is a tribunereview contributing writer more
