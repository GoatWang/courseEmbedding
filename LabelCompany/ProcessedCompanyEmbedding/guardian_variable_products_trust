management agreement permits the adviser subject to the approval of the board to delegate to one or more subadvisers each a “subadviser” and collectively the “subadvisers” the responsibility to provide the daytoday portfolio investment management of each subadvised series subject to the supervision and direction of the adviser the primary responsibility for managing the subadvised series will remain vested in the adviser the adviser will evaluate allocate assets to and oversee the subadvisers and make recommendations about their hiring termination and replacement to the board at all

policy and provisions of the act applicants believe that the requested relief meets this standard because as further explained in the application the investment management agreement will remain
