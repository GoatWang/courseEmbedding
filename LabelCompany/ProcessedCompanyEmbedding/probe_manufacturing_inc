in electrical and electronic equipment ec commonly referred to as the restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs was adopted in february  by the european union rohs is not the only environmental standard of which electronic product developers should be aware manufacturers will find that it is cheaper to have only a single bill of materials bom for a product that is distributed worldwide instead of customizing the product to fit each country’s specific environmental laws therefore they develop their own standards which allow only the strictest of all allowable substances pmi

march   and an accumulated deficit of  as of march   and used  in net cash from operating activities for the three months ended march   therefore there is substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its goals and reach a profitable operating stand and is still dependent upon its ability  to obtain sufficient debt andor equity capital andor  to generate positive cash flow from operations our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the following � changes in the macroeconomic environment and related changes in consumer demand � the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing the number and size of new manufacturing programs the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity seasonal demand shortages of components and other factors � the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance � our components offerings which have required that we make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products � our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our oem customers � our customers ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities � our customers decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements � our exposure to financially troubled customers and � integration of acquired businesses and facilities page  of  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in
