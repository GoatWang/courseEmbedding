shareholder shares offered  shares outstanding  lockup period days  lockup expiration  quiet period expiration  cik  based on an estimated initial public offering price of   per share which is the midpoint of the offering price range we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering after deducting underwriting commissions and expenses payable by us and other offering expenses payable by us will be approximately   million if we sell a minimum of   shares approximately   million if we sell   shares which is the midpoint between the minimum and maximum number of shares in the offering and approximately   million if we sell all   shares of our common stock in this offering however this is a best efforts offering and there is no assurance that we will sell any shares or receive any proceeds we intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows assuming midpoint of assuming minimum and assuming minimum maximum maximum offering offering offering costs to prepare filings with fda    complete phase ii clinical trial for existing combination trial of oncoprex with erlotinib    commence a phase iii clinical trial of oncoprex in combination with an immunotherapy including thirdparty manufacturing of product candidate    preclinical research including biomarker studies    research and development costs    working capital and general corporate purposes    expenses associated with completing our existing phase ii clinical trial and commencing a planned phase iii clinical trial generally consist of our estimate of the costs charged to us by md anderson or other clinical trial sites to perform the clinical trials for us research and development costs generally consist of our estimate of the costs associated with contractors and advisors retained by us to assist us with development of clinical strategies monitoring our clinical trials and sites clinical data analysis and other similar functions related to our current and planned clinical trials for this reason certain estimated research and development costs as well as certain estimated costs to prepare fda filings relate to the existing phase ii and planned phase iii trials even if we complete only the minimum offering we estimate that we will have sufficient funds to complete our existing phase ii clinical trial for oncoprex combined with erlotinib and to complete the majority of a phase iii clinical trial for oncoprex combined with an immunotherapy based on our estimate that the total cost of a phase iii trials for oncoprex combined with an immunotherapy to be approximately  million if we complete the minimum offering we estimate that we will require additional financing of at least   million to complete such a trial plus an additional   million for working capital to fund our operations during the pendency of the trial the timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to predict and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate we believe the net proceeds of this offering together with our cash and cash equivalents including the remaining proceeds from our recent private placements will be sufficient to meet our cash operational and liquidity requirements for at least   months if we sell a minimum of   shares and for at least   months if we sell all   shares of our common stock in this offering as of the date of this prospectus we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering accordingly our management will have broad discretion in the application of these proceeds net offering proceeds not immediately applied to the uses summarized above will be invested in shortterm investments such as money market funds commercial paper us treasury bills and similar securities investments pending their use the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change we have competitors in the united states europe and elsewhere including major multinational pharmaceutical companies established biotechnology companies specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies and universities and other research institutions smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies the unmet medical need for more effective cancer therapies is such that anticancer drugs are by a significant margin the leading class of drugs in development these include a wide array of products against cancer targeting many of the same indications as our drug candidates there are a number of drugs approved and under development for treatment of lung cancer treatments competitive with our primary product candidates generally fall into the following categories chemotherapies such as cisplatin carboplatin docetaxel and pemetrexed targeted therapies such as erlotinib gefitinib afatinib and osimertinib and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and car and car t cells and oncolytic virusbased technology data indicate that oncoprex when combined with targeted therapies and immunotherapies may enhance the benefit of those therapies therefore we believe that oncoprex could be administered in combination with targeted therapies and immunotherapies and thus may not be a direct competitor of those drugs in addition new drug candidates are constantly being conceived and developed any such competing therapy may be more effective andor costeffective than ours many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources such as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing obtaining regulatory approvals recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products these companies also have significantly greater research sales and marketing capabilities and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to inlicense novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete as a result of these factors our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection andor fda approval or discovering developing and commercializing drugs for the cancer indications that we are targeting before we do or may develop drugs that are deemed to be more effective or gain greater market acceptance than ours smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large established companies in addition many universities and private and public research institutes may become active in our target disease areas our competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop which could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payers will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products our commercial opportunities could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective safer less toxic more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products in geographies that are critical to our commercial success competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry we believe the competitive factors that will determine the success of our programs will be the efficacy safety pricing and reimbursement and convenience of our current and potential product candidates company description genprex™ is a clinical stage gene therapy company developing a new approach to treating cancer based upon our novel proprietary technology platform including our initial product candidate oncoprex™ immunogene therapy or oncoprex our platform technologies are designed to administer cancer fighting genes by encapsulating them into nanoscale hollow spheres called nanovesicles which are then administered intravenously and taken up by tumor cells where they express proteins that are missing or found in low quantities oncoprex has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells reestablishes pathways for apoptosis or programmed cell death in cancer cells and modulates the immune response against cancer cells oncoprex has also been shown to block mechanisms that create drug resistance we hold an exclusive worldwide license from the university of texas md anderson cancer center or md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of a series of genes that have been shown in preclinical and clinical research to have cancer fighting properties with oncoprex we are initially targeting nonsmall cell lung cancer or nsclc researchers at md anderson have conducted two phase i clinical trials and are currently conducting an ongoing phase ii clinical trial of oncoprex in nsclc according to the world health organization lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide killing more people than breast colon kidney liver prostate and skin cancers combined and is the second most common type of cancer each year there are over  million new lung cancer cases and  million deaths from lung cancer worldwide and in the united states there are over  new cases and more than  deaths from lung cancer per year nsclc represents  of all lung cancers according to a  american cancer society report the fiveyear survival rate for stage iv metastatic nsclc is about  and overall survival for lung cancer has not improved appreciably in the last  years we believe that there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatments for nsclc in the united states and globally and we believe that oncoprex may be suitable for a majority of nsclc patients we believe that our platform technologies could allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer cancer results from genetic mutations mutations that lead to cancer are usually present in two major classes of genes oncogenes which are involved in functions such as signal transduction and transcription and tumor suppressor genes which play a role in governing cell proliferation by regulating transcription transduction is the process by which chemical and physical signals are transmitted through cells transcription is the process by which a cell’s dna sequence is copied to make rna molecules which then play a role in protein expression in normal cells mutations in oncogenes are discovered and targeted for elimination by tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells the oncogene mutations may overwhelm the natural tumor suppression processes or those tumor suppression processes may be impaired or absent functional alterations due to mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may result in the abnormal and uncontrolled growth patterns characteristic of cancer these genetic alterations facilitate such malignant growth by affecting signal transduction pathways and transcription thus inhibiting normal growth signaling in the cell circumventing the natural process of apoptosis evading the immune system’s response to cancer and inducing angiogenesis which is the formation of new blood vessels that supply cancer cells the most common genetic alterations present in nsclc are in tumor suppressor genes against which few targeted small molecule drugs have been developed each of the two sets of chromosomes in the cell nucleus includes two copies of each gene called alleles which may be identical or may show differences in most situations tumor suppressor genes require both alleles of a gene to be deleted or inactivated to impair tumor suppression activity and lead to tumor growth the replacement of just one functional allele may therefore be enough to restore the normal cellular functions of growth regulation and apoptosis among the genetic conditions associated with lung cancer are the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors or egfrs and mutations of kinases kinases are enzymes that play an important role in signal transduction through the modification of proteins by adding or taking away phosphate groups a process called dephosphorylation to change the proteins’ function when two egfr transmembrane proteins are brought to proximity on the cell membrane surface or dimerize either through a ligand or binding molecule that binds to the extracellular receptor or through some other process the intracellular proteinkinase domains can autophosphorylate and activate downstream processes including cell signaling pathways that can lead to either cell cycle arrest or cell growth and proliferation egfrs and kinases can act similarly to a switch that turns “on” and “off” when phosphate groups are either added or taken away mutated kinases can have a malfunctioning onoff switch causing the switch to be stuck in the “on” position or failing to turn the switch “off” leading to the loss of cell control a subset of nsclc patients approximately  of nsclc patients of north american and european descent and approximately  to  of nsclc patients of asian descent carry an egfr mutation that makes their tumors sensitive to tkis such as erlotinib however even for these patients tumor resistance to tkis frequently develops within two years resulting in eventual disease progression erlotinib generally does not benefit nsclc patients who do not have this activating egfr mutation however our clinical and preclinical data have shown that the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib can increase antitumor activity even in cancers without the egfr mutations as well as in cancers that have become resistant to erlotinib for this reason we believe oncoprex may be suitable for the majority of nsclc patients cancer can spread when cells’ natural cancer suppression functions are impaired the tumor suppressor gene called tumor suppressor candidate  or tusc which was formerly known as fus has been shown to affect both cell proliferation and apoptosis tusc is a pankinase inhibitor which means that it has the ability to inhibit multiple kinase receptors such as egfr and plateletderived growth factor receptor or pdgfr tusc is frequently inactivated early in the development of lung cancer and loss of tusc expression in nsclc is associated with significantly worse overall survival compared to patients with normal tusc expression many types of cancer cells including approximately  of nsclc cells lack expression of tusc cancer can also spread when the body’s natural immune functions are impaired including by the cancer cells themselves pd or programmed death is a receptor expressed on the surface of activated t cells which are part of the body’s immune system pdl or programmed death ligand is a proteinreceptor expressed on the surface of cancer and other cells the binding of pd to pdl has been speculated to contribute to cancer cells’ ability to evade the body’s immune response pd and molecules like it are called immune checkpoints because they can impede the normal immune response for example by blocking the t cells from attacking the cancer cells in many cancers pdl receptors are upregulated and substantial research is now being performed in the emerging field of immunooncology to discover drugs or antibodies that could block pdl and similar receptors it is believed that blocking the pdpdl interaction pathway and other similar checkpoints such as cytotoxic tlymphocyteassociated protein  or ctla with drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can prevent cancer cells from inactivating t cells our oncoprex immunogene therapy is designed to interrupt cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells and to target and kill cancer cells via receptor pathways and also to stimulate the natural immune responses against cancer oncoprex combines features of gene therapy and immunotherapy in that it upregulates tusc expression in the cell and also increases the antitumor immune cell population and downregulates pdl receptors thereby boosting the immune response to cancer oncoprex consists of a tusc gene encapsulated in a positively charged nanovesicle made from lipid molecules with a positive electrical charge oncoprex is injected intravenously and can specifically target cancer cells which generally have a negative electrical charge once oncoprex is taken up into a cancer cell the tusc gene is expressed into a protein that is capable of restoring certain defective functions arising in the cancer cell oncoprex nanovesicles are designed to deliver the functioning tusc gene to cancer cells while minimizing their uptake by normal tissue tumor biopsy studies conducted at md anderson show that the uptake of tusc in tumor cells after oncoprex treatment is  to  times the uptake in normal cells we believe that oncoprex unlike other gene therapies which either need to be delivered directly into tumors or require cells to be removed from the body reengineered and then reinserted into the body is the first systemic gene therapy to be used for cancer in humans our clinical and preclinical data indicate that oncoprex can be combined with the widely used anticancer drug erlotinib marketed as tarceva® by genentech inc in humans erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or tki which uses a mechanism of action similar to that of pankinase inhibitors to block the action of tyrosine kinases which are a type of kinase involved in many cell functions including cell signaling growth and division in addition md anderson researchers have conducted preclinical studies combining oncoprex with · the tki gefitinib marketed as iressa® by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals in animals and in human nsclc cells · mk in animals mk is an inhibitor of akt kinases which affect cell signaling pathways downstream from tyrosine kinases · an antipd antibody equivalent to the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab marketed as opdivo® by bristolmyers squibb company in animals and · an antictla antibody equivalent to ipilimumab marketed as yervoy® by bristolmyers squibb company in animals the manufacturers of the marketed drugs were not involved in any of our clinical or preclinical studies in studies involving marketed drugs the drugs were administered concurrently with oncoprex without being modified in any way and the antibodies used in our preclinical studies that did not use the marketed drugs were the nonhumanized equivalent to marketed drugs data from these clinical and preclinical studies indicate that combining oncoprex with these other therapies yields results more favorable than either these therapies or oncoprex alone with minimal side effects relative to other lung cancer drugs thereby potentially making oncoprex a therapy complementary to these cancer treatments in addition based on our clinical and preclinical studies and on preclinical studies conducted by others we believe that oncoprex could be combined with other lung cancer drugs that have similar mechanisms of action to the drugs mentioned above such as pembrolizumab marketed as keytruda® by merck  co nivolumab marketed as opdivo® by bristolmyers squibb company and atezolizumab marketed as tecentriq® by genentechroche researchers at md anderson have collaborated with other researchers to identify other genes such as those in the p chromosomal region that may act as tumor suppressors or have other cancer fighting functions we hold rights to certain of these genes under license agreements with md anderson date from preclinical studies performed by others suggest that product candidates that could be derived from our technology platform could be effective against other types of cancer including breast head and neck renal cell kidney and soft tissue cancer as well as nsclc therefore our platform technologies may allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer md anderson researchers have completed the first phase of a phase iii clinical trial of oncoprex in combination with erlotinib in patients with stage iv metastatic or recurrent nsclc that is not potentially curable by radiotherapy or surgery whether or not they have received prior chemotherapy and whether or not they have an activating egfr mutation the phase i portion of the trial was a doseescalating study with primary endpoints of establishing the safety and tolerability of the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib and establishing the maximum tolerated dose or mtd the secondary endpoint of the phase i portion of the trial was to assess the toxicity of the combination of oncoprex with erlotinib in the phase i portion of the trial which began in   subjects were treated and the mtd was determined to be the highest tested dose  mgkg of oncoprex administered every  days and  mg of erlotinib per day toxicities were found to compare favorably with those of other lung cancer drugs the phase ii portion of the trial is designed to include subjects treated with the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib at the mtd with the primary goal of measuring the response rate and secondary endpoints of stable disease time to progression and overall survival the response rate for cancer therapies is defined under the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors or recist as complete response cr  partial response pr disease control rate is defined under the recist criteria as complete response cr  partial response pr  stable disease sdweeks enrollment criteria for the second phase of the phase iii clinical trial are identical to those in the first phase the phase ii portion of the trial began in june  and is ongoing at md anderson of the  patients allowed in the protocol for the phase ii portion of the trial  have been enrolled and nine are evaluable for response under the trial protocol because they have received  or more cycles of treatment interim results show that four of the patients had tumor regression and one patient had a complete response or cr under the recist criteria the patient with the cr had disappearance of the lung primary tumor as well as lung liver and lymph node metastases the median response duration for all patients which is defined as the median time between when response is first noted to the time when cancer progression is observed was three months the response rate for the nine patients evaluated to date was  and the disease control rate for the nine patients was  the response rate and disease control rate to date in the phase ii portion of our phase iii clinical trial substantially exceeds the response rate of  with no crs and disease control rate of  reported for a clinical trial of the tki afatinib marketed as gilotrif® by boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals inc in a study referred to as the luxlung  clinical trial a total of  patients were enrolled in that phase iibiii clinical trial whose primary endpoint was overall survival and whose secondary endpoints were progressionfree survival recist response quality of life and safety the luxlung  clinical trial was a randomized double blinded phase iibiii clinical trial treating subjects with stage iiib or iv adenocarcinoma a type of nsclc the phase ii portion of our phase iii trial is not blinded and is designed to treat nsclc subjects regardless of egfr status preliminary analysis of the early data from the phase ii portion of our phase iii trial supports our belief that oncoprex may provide medical benefit in several subpopulations of nsclc patients for which there is an unmet medical need and may provide pathways for accelerated approval by the us food and drug administration of fda as a result of these initial findings in april  we suspended enrollment of new patients in the phase ii portion of the trial to collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek fda guidance as to whether the protocol for this clinical trial could be modified to expand enrollment and also to divide the patients into cohorts with a view toward seeking accelerated approval in one or more of these cohort populations we have completed the collection and analysis of the additional preliminary data and expect to present our findings to the fda within the next several months although this clinical trial is currently closed to new patient enrollment it is not terminated and is considered “ongoing” because activities such as patient followup and further data collection and analysis continue if we reach an agreement with the fda regarding expanded patient enrollment and defined patient cohorts then we plan to amend the trial protocol accordingly and proceed with the amended protocol at md anderson and several additional clinical trial sites amendments to the phase ii clinical trial protocol will require approval of the investigational review board or irb of each site where the amended trial is conducted if we do not reach an agreement with the fda on these changes then we plan to reopen enrollment in the current version of the phase ii portion of the trial at md anderson and at additional clinical trial sites in that event we will need to provide md anderson with plans and funding to move ahead with the trial whether under the original protocol or a revised protocol we intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to add additional clinical trial sites in  md anderson researchers completed a phase i clinical trial of oncoprex as a monotherapy the primary objective of this phase i trial was to assess the toxicity of oncoprex administered intravenously and to determine the mtd and recommended phase ii dose of oncoprex alone secondary objectives were to assess the expression of tusc following intravenous delivery of oncoprex in tumor biopsies and also to assess the anticancer activity of oncoprex this trial demonstrated that oncoprex was well tolerated established the mtd and the therapeutic dosage for oncoprex at  mgkg administered every  days and showed that cancer growth was halted in a number of patients tumor regressions occurred in primary lung tumors and metastatic cancers in the liver pancreas and lymph nodes pre and posttreatment patient biopsies demonstrated that intravenous oncoprex selectively and preferentially targeted patients’ cancer cells and suggested that clinical anticancer activity was mediated by tusc we believe that oncoprex’ combination of pankinase inhibition direct induction of apoptosis anticancer immune modulation and complementary action with targeted drugs and immunotherapies is unique and positions oncoprex to provide treatment for patients with nsclc and possibly other cancers who are not benefitting from currently offered therapies our oncoprex immunogene therapy technology was discovered through a lung cancer research consortium from md anderson and the university of texas southwestern medical center or utswmc along with the national cancer institute or nci the tusc discovery teams included jack a roth md facs chairman of our scientific and medical advisory board we have assembled a team of experts in clinical and translational research including laboratory scientists medical oncologists and biostatisticians to pursue the development and commercialization of oncoprex and other potential product candidates our technology discoveries and research and development programs have been the subjects of numerous peerreviewed publications and have been supported by small business innovation research or sbir grants and grants from the national institutes of health the united states department of treasury and the state of texas we hold a worldwide exclusive license from md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of tusc and other genes that have been shown to have cancer fighting properties as well as a number of related

unless the context otherwise requires its predecessors overview genprex™ is a clinical stage gene therapy company developing a new approach to treating cancer based upon our novel proprietary technology platform including our initial product candidate oncoprex™ immunogene therapy or oncoprex our platform technologies are designed to administer cancer fighting genes by encapsulating them into nanoscale hollow spheres called nanovesicles which are then administered intravenously and taken up by tumor cells where they express proteins that are missing or found in low quantities oncoprex has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells reestablishes pathways for apoptosis or programmed cell death in cancer cells and modulates the immune response against cancer cells oncoprex has also been shown to block mechanisms that create drug resistance we hold an exclusive worldwide license from the university of texas md anderson cancer center or md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of a series of genes that have been shown in preclinical and clinical research to have cancer fighting properties with oncoprex we are initially targeting nonsmall cell lung cancer or nsclc researchers at md anderson have conducted two phase i clinical trials and are currently conducting an ongoing phase ii clinical trial of oncoprex in nsclc according to the world health organization lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide killing more people than breast colon kidney liver prostate and skin cancers combined and is the second most common type of cancer each year there are over  million new lung cancer cases and  million deaths from lung cancer worldwide and in the united states there are over  new cases and more than  deaths from lung cancer per year nsclc represents  of all lung cancers according to a  american cancer society report the fiveyear survival rate for stage iv metastatic nsclc is about  and overall survival for lung cancer has not improved appreciably in the last  years we believe that there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatments for nsclc in the united states and globally and we believe that oncoprex may be suitable for a majority of nsclc patients we believe that our platform technologies could allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer our research and development pipeline shown in “our pipeline” below demonstrates our clinical and preclinical progress to date cancer results from genetic mutations mutations that lead to cancer are usually present in two major classes of genes oncogenes which are involved in functions such as signal transduction and transcription and tumor suppressor genes which play a role in governing cell proliferation by regulating transcription  transduction is the process by which chemical and physical signals are transmitted through cells transcription is the process by which a cell’s dna sequence is copied to make rna molecules which then play a role in protein expression in normal cells mutations in oncogenes are discovered and targeted for elimination by tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells the oncogene mutations may overwhelm the natural tumor suppression processes or those tumor suppression processes may be impaired or absent  functional alterations due to mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may result in the abnormal and uncontrolled growth patterns characteristic of cancer these genetic alterations facilitate such malignant growth by affecting signal transduction pathways and transcription thus inhibiting normal growth signaling in the cell circumventing the natural process of apoptosis evading the immune system’s response to cancer and inducing angiogenesis which is the formation of new blood vessels that supply cancer cells the most common genetic alterations present in nsclc are in tumor suppressor genes against which few targeted small molecule drugs have been developed each of the two sets of chromosomes in the cell nucleus includes two copies of each gene called alleles which may be identical or may show differences in most situations tumor suppressor genes require both alleles of a gene to be deleted or inactivated to impair tumor suppression activity and lead to tumor growth the replacement of just one functional allele may therefore be enough to restore the normal cellular functions of growth regulation and apoptosis among the genetic conditions associated with lung cancer are the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors or egfrs and mutations of kinases kinases are enzymes that play an important role in signal transduction through the modification of proteins by adding or taking away phosphate groups a process called dephosphorylation to change the proteins’ function when two egfr transmembrane proteins are brought to proximity on the cell membrane surface or dimerize either through a ligand or binding molecule that binds to the extracellular receptor or through some other process the intracellular proteinkinase domains can autophosphorylate and activate downstream processes including cell signaling pathways that can lead to either cell cycle arrest or cell growth and proliferation egfrs and kinases can act similarly to a switch that turns “on” and “off” when phosphate groups are either added or taken away mutated kinases can have a malfunctioning onoff switch causing the switch to be stuck in the “on” position or failing to turn the switch “off” leading to the loss of cell control  table of contents a subset of nsclc patients approximately  of nsclc patients of north american and european descent and approximately  to  of nsclc patients of asian descent carry an egfr mutation that makes their tumors sensitive to tkis such as erlotinib however even for these patients tumor resistance to tkis frequently develops within two years resulting in eventual disease progression erlotinib generally does not benefit nsclc patients who do not have this activating egfr mutation however our clinical and preclinical data have shown that the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib can increase antitumor activity even in cancers without the egfr mutations as well as in cancers that have become resistant to erlotinib for this reason we believe oncoprex may be suitable for the majority of nsclc patients cancer can spread when cells’ natural cancer suppression functions are impaired the tumor suppressor gene called tumor suppressor candidate  or tusc which was formerly known as fus has been shown to affect both cell proliferation and apoptosis tusc is a pankinase inhibitor which means that it has the ability to inhibit multiple kinase receptors such as egfr and plateletderived growth factor receptor or pdgfr tusc is frequently inactivated early in the development of lung cancer and loss of tusc expression in nsclc is associated with significantly worse overall survival compared to patients with normal tusc expression many types of cancer cells including approximately  of nsclc cells lack expression of tusc cancer can also spread when the body’s natural immune functions are impaired including by the cancer cells themselves pd or programmed death is a receptor expressed on the surface of activated t cells which are part of the body’s immune system pdl or programmed death ligand is a proteinreceptor expressed on the surface of cancer and other cells the binding of pd to pdl has been speculated to contribute to cancer cells’ ability to evade the body’s immune response pd and molecules like it are called immune checkpoints because they can impede the normal immune response for example by blocking the t cells from attacking the cancer cells in many cancers pdl receptors are upregulated and substantial research is now being performed in the emerging field of immunooncology to discover drugs or antibodies that could block pdl and similar receptors it is believed that blocking the pdpdl interaction pathway and other similar checkpoints such as cytotoxic tlymphocyteassociated protein  or ctla with drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can prevent cancer cells from inactivating t cells our oncoprex immunogene therapy is designed to interrupt cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells and to target and kill cancer cells via receptor pathways and also to stimulate the natural immune responses against cancer oncoprex combines features of gene therapy and immunotherapy in that it upregulates tusc expression in the cell and also increases the antitumor immune cell population and downregulates pdl receptors thereby boosting the immune response to cancer oncoprex consists of a tusc gene encapsulated in a positively charged nanovesicle made from lipid molecules with a positive electrical charge oncoprex is injected intravenously and can specifically target cancer cells which generally have a negative electrical charge once oncoprex is taken up into a cancer cell the tusc gene is expressed into a protein that is capable of restoring certain defective functions arising in the cancer cell oncoprex nanovesicles are designed to deliver the functioning tusc gene to cancer cells while minimizing their uptake by normal tissue tumor biopsy studies conducted at md anderson show that the uptake of tusc in tumor cells after oncoprex treatment is  to  times the uptake in normal cells we believe that oncoprex unlike other gene therapies which either need to be delivered directly into tumors or require cells to be removed from the body reengineered and then reinserted into the body is the first systemic gene therapy to be used for cancer in humans our clinical and preclinical data indicate that oncoprex can be combined with the widely used anticancer drug erlotinib marketed as tarceva® by genentech inc in humans  erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or tki which uses a mechanism of action similar to that of pankinase inhibitors to block the action of tyrosine kinases which are a type of kinase involved in many cell functions including cell signaling growth and division in addition md anderson researchers have conducted preclinical studies combining oncoprex with · the tki gefitinib marketed as iressa® by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals in animals and in human nsclc cells · mk in animals mk is an inhibitor of akt kinases which affect cell signaling pathways downstream from tyrosine kinases · an antipd antibody equivalent to the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab marketed as opdivo® by bristolmyers squibb company in animals and · an antictla antibody equivalent to ipilimumab marketed as yervoy® by bristolmyers squibb company in animals the manufacturers of the marketed drugs were not involved in any of our clinical or preclinical studies in studies involving marketed drugs the drugs were administered concurrently with oncoprex without being modified in any way and the antibodies used in our preclinical studies that did not use the marketed drugs were the nonhumanized equivalent to marketed drugs  table of contents data from these clinical and preclinical studies indicate that combining oncoprex with these other therapies yields results more favorable than either these therapies or oncoprex alone with minimal side effects relative to other lung cancer drugs thereby potentially making oncoprex a therapy complementary to these cancer treatments  in addition based on our clinical and preclinical studies and on preclinical studies conducted by others we believe that oncoprex could be combined with other lung cancer drugs that have similar mechanisms of action to the drugs mentioned above such as pembrolizumab marketed as keytruda® by merck  co nivolumab marketed as opdivo® by bristolmyers squibb company and atezolizumab marketed as tecentriq® by genentechroche   researchers at md anderson have collaborated with other researchers to identify other genes such as those in the p chromosomal region that may act as tumor suppressors or have other cancer fighting functions we hold rights to certain of these genes under license agreements with md anderson  date from preclinical studies performed by others suggest that product candidates that could be derived from our technology platform could be effective against other types of cancer including breast head and neck renal cell kidney and soft tissue cancer as well as nsclc therefore our platform technologies may allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer md anderson researchers have completed the first phase of a phase iii clinical trial of oncoprex in combination with erlotinib in patients with stage iv metastatic or recurrent nsclc that is not potentially curable by radiotherapy or surgery whether or not they have received prior chemotherapy and whether or not they have an activating egfr mutation  the phase i portion of the trial was a doseescalating study with primary endpoints of establishing the safety and tolerability of the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib and establishing the maximum tolerated dose or mtd the secondary endpoint of the phase i portion of the trial was to assess the toxicity of the combination of oncoprex with erlotinib in the phase i portion of the trial which began in   subjects were treated and the mtd was determined to be the highest tested dose  mgkg of oncoprex administered every  days and  mg of erlotinib per day toxicities were found to compare favorably with those of other lung cancer drugs the phase ii portion of the trial is designed to include subjects treated with the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib at the mtd with the primary goal of measuring the response rate and secondary endpoints of stable disease time to progression and overall survival the response rate for cancer therapies is defined under the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors or recist as complete response cr  partial response pr disease control rate is defined under the recist criteria as complete response cr  partial response pr  stable disease sdweeks enrollment criteria for the second phase of the phase iii clinical trial are identical to those in the first phase the phase ii portion of the trial began in june  and is ongoing at md anderson of the  patients allowed in the protocol for the phase ii portion of the trial  have been enrolled and nine are evaluable for response under the trial protocol because they have received  or more cycles of treatment interim results show that four of the patients had tumor regression and one patient had a complete response or cr under the recist criteria the patient with the cr had disappearance of the lung primary tumor as well as lung liver and lymph node metastases the median response duration for all patients which is defined as the median time between when response is first noted to the time when cancer progression is observed was three months the response rate for the nine patients evaluated to date was  and the disease control rate for the nine patients was  the response rate and disease control rate to date in the phase ii portion of our phase iii clinical trial substantially exceeds the response rate of  with no crs and disease control rate of  reported for a clinical trial of the tki afatinib marketed as gilotrif® by boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals inc in a study referred to as the luxlung  clinical trial a total of  patients were enrolled in that phase iibiii clinical trial whose primary endpoint was overall survival and whose secondary endpoints were progressionfree survival recist response quality of life and safety the luxlung  clinical trial was a randomized double blinded phase iibiii clinical trial treating subjects with stage iiib or iv adenocarcinoma a type of nsclc the phase ii portion of our phase iii trial is not blinded and is designed to treat nsclc subjects regardless of egfr status preliminary analysis of the early data from the phase ii portion of our phase iii trial supports our belief that oncoprex may provide medical benefit in several subpopulations of nsclc patients for which there is an unmet medical need and may provide pathways for accelerated approval by the us food and drug administration of fda as a result of these initial findings in april  we suspended enrollment of new patients in the phase ii portion of the trial to collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek fda guidance as to whether the protocol for this clinical trial could be modified to expand enrollment and also to divide the patients into cohorts with a view toward seeking accelerated approval in one or more of these cohort populations we have completed the collection and analysis of the additional preliminary data and expect to present our findings to the fda within the next several months although this clinical trial is currently closed to new patient enrollment it is not terminated and is considered “ongoing” because activities such as patient followup and further data collection and analysis continue  table of contents if we reach an agreement with the fda regarding expanded patient enrollment and defined patient cohorts then we plan to amend the trial protocol accordingly and proceed with the amended protocol at md anderson and several additional clinical trial sites amendments to the phase ii clinical trial protocol will require approval of the investigational review board or irb of each site where the amended trial is conducted if we do not reach an agreement with the fda on these changes then we plan to reopen enrollment in the current version of the phase ii portion of the trial at md anderson and at additional clinical trial sites in that event we will need to provide md anderson with plans and funding to move ahead with the trial whether under the original protocol or a revised protocol we intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to add additional clinical trial sites in  md anderson researchers completed a phase i clinical trial of oncoprex as a monotherapy  the primary objective of this phase i trial was to assess the toxicity of oncoprex administered intravenously and to determine the mtd and recommended phase ii dose of oncoprex alone secondary objectives were to assess the expression of tusc following intravenous delivery of oncoprex in tumor biopsies and also to assess the anticancer activity of oncoprex this trial demonstrated that oncoprex was well tolerated established the mtd and the therapeutic dosage for oncoprex at  mgkg administered every  days and showed that cancer growth was halted in a number of patients tumor regressions occurred in primary lung tumors and metastatic cancers in the liver pancreas and lymph nodes pre and posttreatment patient biopsies demonstrated that intravenous oncoprex selectively and preferentially targeted patients’ cancer cells and suggested that clinical anticancer activity was mediated by tusc we believe that oncoprex’ combination of pankinase inhibition direct induction of apoptosis anticancer immune modulation and complementary action with targeted drugs and immunotherapies is unique and positions oncoprex to provide treatment for patients with nsclc and possibly other cancers who are not benefitting from currently offered therapies our oncoprex immunogene therapy technology was discovered through a lung cancer research consortium from md anderson and the university of texas southwestern medical center or utswmc along with the national cancer institute or nci the tusc discovery teams included jack a roth md facs chairman of our scientific and medical advisory board we have assembled a team of experts in clinical and translational research including laboratory scientists medical oncologists and biostatisticians to pursue the development and commercialization of oncoprex and other potential product candidates our technology discoveries and research and development programs have been the subjects of numerous peerreviewed publications and have been supported by small business innovation research or sbir grants and grants from the national institutes of health the united states department of treasury and the state of texas we hold a worldwide exclusive license from md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of tusc and other genes that have been shown to have cancer fighting properties as well as a number of related technologies including  issued patents and six pending patent applications our pipeline we are developing oncoprex our lead product candidate to be administered with erlotinib for nsclc we are also conducting preclinical research with the goal of developing oncoprex to be administered with immunotherapies in nsclc  in addition we conducted research into other tumor suppressor genes associated with chromosome p our research and development pipeline is shown below  table of contents    table of contents our strategy we intend to develop and commercialize treatments for cancer based on our proprietary gene therapy platform alone or in combination with other cancer therapies key elements of our strategy include   • conduct ongoing and new clinical trials  we plan to continue clinical trials of oncoprex immunogene therapy in combination with erlotinib for treatment of nsclc while exploring pathways to accelerated fda approval of this combination in subpopulations of nsclc patients for whom there is currently no approved therapy we also plan to pursue a clinical trial of the combination of oncoprex with antipd immunotherapy we may also pursue additional clinical trials of the combination of oncoprex plus an immunotherapy called ctla immunotherapy as well as possible multidrug combinations of oncoprex with additional targeted therapies and immunotherapies • investigate the effectiveness of oncoprex in other cancers  we may also explore the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib in other cancers such as soft tissue kidney head and neck andor breast cancer and we may pursue development of additional proprietary genes alone or in combination with egfr tkis such as erlotinib andor with immunotherapies • prepare to commercialize oncoprex  we plan to continue to develop the manufacturing process development and other capabilities needed to commercialize oncoprex • pursue strategic partnerships  as we gather additional clinical data we plan to pursue strategic partnerships with other developers and providers of anticancer drugs to investigate possible therapeutic combinations of oncoprex with drugs manufactured by others to accelerate the development of our current and potential product candidates through codevelopment and to increase the commercial opportunities for our current and potential product candidates • develop our platform technology  we plan to investigate the applicability of our platform technology with additional anticancer drugs risks relating to our business our business and our ability to implement our business strategy are subject to numerous risks as more fully described in the section entitled “risk factors” immediately following this prospectus summary you should read these risks before you invest in our common stock we may be unable for many reasons including those that are beyond our control to implement our business strategy in particular risks associated with our business include the following  • we have incurred significant losses since our inception including an accumulated deficit of approximately  million as of march   and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future we will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals • our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in that if we are unable to raise additional capital in a timely manner our clinical trials and other operations will be negatively affected • immunotherapy gene therapy and biopharmaceutical product development are highly speculative undertakings that involve a substantial degree of uncertainty because our current and potential gene therapy product candidates are based on novel technologies it is difficult to predict whether they will show consistently favorable results and to predict the time and cost of their development we have never generated any revenue from product sales and we may never be profitable • the phase ii portion of our phase iii clinical trial is at an early stage with a limited number of patients enrolled and the favorable results observed so far may not continue in the current clinical trial or be replicated in other clinical trials especially those involving larger numbers of patients before our phase iii clinical trial oncoprex had previously been tested in only one prior phase i trial which involved  patients and tested oncoprex as a monotherapy • the fda regulatory approval process is lengthy and timeconsuming and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates • the fda may disagree with our plans for pursuing regulatory approval and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates  table of contents • we rely and expect to continue to rely in part on third parties to conduct supervise monitor and maintain data concerning our clinical trials and to manufacture our nanovesicles product candidates and other key materials if these third parties encounter difficulties or perform in an unsatisfactory manner our business may be harmed • we face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize our current and potential product candidates • we are highly dependent on our key personnel and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy • if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates our competitive position could be harmed • the

other information set forth in this prospectus including the financial statements and the related notes before making a decision to buy our common stock if any of the following risks actually occurs our business could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital we will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and if not so available may require us to delay limit reduce or cease our operations we intend to use the proceeds from this offering to advance oncoprex through clinical development as well as for other purposes developing pharmaceutical products including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is expensive we will require substantial additional future capital in order to complete clinical development and commercialize oncoprex if the fda requires that we perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials our expenses will further increase beyond what we currently expect and the anticipated timing of any potential approval of oncoprex would likely be delayed further there can be no assurance that the costs we will need to incur to obtain regulatory approval of oncoprex will not increase we will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and commercialization activities because successful development of our current and potential product candidates is uncertain we are unable to estimate the actual amount of funding we will require to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development the amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to • the progress costs results and timing of our clinical trials for oncoprex • the outcome costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and any other regulatory approvals • the ability of third parties to deliver materials and provide services for us • the costs associated with securing and establishing commercialization and manufacturing capabilities • market acceptance of our current and potential product candidates • the costs of acquiring licensing or investing in businesses products product candidates and technologies • our ability to maintain expand and enforce the scope of our intellectual property portfolio including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make or that we may receive in connection with the licensing filing prosecution defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights • our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel • the effect of competing drug candidates and new product approvals • our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure including financial and reporting systems and • the economic and other terms timing of and success of our existing licensing arrangements and any collaboration licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future some of these factors are outside of our control based upon our currently expected level of operating expenditures if we receive the maximum offering amount we believe that we will be able to fund our operations through  and if we receive the minimum offering amount we believe that we will be able to fund our operations only through  this period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated we cannot assure you that the maximum offering amount will be raised in the event that less than the maximum offering amount is raised we may not have sufficient capital to execute on our business strategy the way we have intended we do not believe that our existing capital resources and the proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to enable us to complete the development and commercialization of oncoprex accordingly we expect that we will need to raise additional funds in the future  table of contents we may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings debt financings government or other thirdparty funding commercialization marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations strategic alliances and licensing arrangements additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all in addition the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock in addition the issuance of additional shares by us or the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our shares to decline any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited and we could be forced to halt operations accordingly our business may fail in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business however our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit opinion for the year ended december   a statement that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our recurring losses and financial condition on december   unless we are able to obtain additional financing enter into strategic alliances andor sell assets the reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors our current lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or enter into strategic alliances if we become unable to obtain additional capital and to continue as a going concern we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements we have never been profitable we have no products approved for commercial sale and to date we have not generated any revenue from product sales as a result our ability to reduce our losses and reach profitability is unproven and we may never achieve or sustain profitability we have never been profitable and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future we have not yet submitted any drug candidates for approval by regulatory authorities in the united states or elsewhere from our inception on april   to march   we accumulated a deficit incurred of approximately  million we incurred net losses of approximately  million and approximately  million for the years ended december   and  respectively and of approximately  million and approximately  million for the threemonth periods ended march   and  respectively to date we have devoted most of our financial resources to our corporate overhead and research and development including our preclinical development activities and clinical trials we have not generated any revenues from product sales we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of and seek regulatory approvals for our current and potential product candidates prepare for and begin the commercialization of any approved products and add infrastructure and personnel to support our continuing product development efforts we anticipate that any such losses could be significant for the next several years if oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates fails in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval or if our drug candidates do not achieve market acceptance we may never become profitable as a result of the foregoing we expect to continue to experience net losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future these net losses and negative cash flows have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve profitability in addition our expenses could increase if we are required by the fda to perform studies or trials in addition to those currently expected or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our drug candidates the amount of future net losses will depend in part on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues  table of contents we have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on an annual basis which may make it difficult to predict our future performance we are a clinical stage gene therapy company with a limited operating history our operations to date have been limited to conducting clinical and preclinical research we have not yet obtained any regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates consequently any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or approved products on the market our operating results are expected to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include • any delays in regulatory review and approval of our current and potential product candidates in clinical development including our ability to receive approval from the fda for oncoprex • delays in the commencement enrollment and timing of clinical trials • the success of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development • potential side effects of our current and potential product candidates that could delay or prevent approval or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market • our ability to obtain additional funding to develop product candidates • our ability to identify and develop additional drug candidates beyond oncoprex • competition from existing products or new products that continue to emerge • the ability of patients or healthcare providers to obtain coverage or sufficient reimbursement for our products • our ability to adhere to clinical trial requirements directly or with third parties such as contract research organizations or cros • our dependency on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture our products and key ingredients • our ability to establish or maintain collaborations licensing or other arrangements particularly with md anderson • our ability to defend against any challenges to our intellectual property including claims of patent infringement • our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights against potential competitors • our ability to secure additional intellectual property protection for our drug candidates in development and associated technologies • our ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively and • potential product liability claims accordingly the results of any historical quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance  table of contents risks related to development and commercialization of our current and potential product candidates our success depends greatly on the success of our development of oncoprex for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer and our pipeline of product candidates beyond this lead indication is extremely early stage and limited at this time we are actively pursuing development of only one product candidate oncoprex for nonsmall cell lung cancer therefore we are dependent on the success of oncoprex in the near term we cannot provide you any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance oncoprex through the development process or that any development problems we experience in the future will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs or that such development problems can be solved we may also experience delays in developing a sustainable reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners or developing or validating product release assays in a timely manner which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis if at all immunotherapy gene therapy and biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty because oncoprex and our other potential product candidates are based upon novel technology it is difficult to predict whether either as standalone therapies or in combination with other drugs they will show consistently favorable results and to predict the time and cost of their development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval few gene therapy products have been approved in the united states or europe we may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical studies which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our current and potential product candidates we may encounter delays in our clinical studies or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of fda and other regulatory authorities we may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates or to develop product candidates that we have identified negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy and genetic research may damage public perception of our current and potential product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our current and potential product candidates public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community in particular our success will depend upon physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our current and potential product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our current and potential product candidates in lieu of or in addition to existing treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available more restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our current and potential product candidates or demand for any products we may develop adverse events in our clinical trials even if not ultimately attributable to our current and potential product candidates and the resulting publicity could lead to increased governmental regulation unfavorable public perception potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates concern about the environmental spread of our product whether real or anticipated may hinder the commercialization of our products delays in the commencement enrollment and completion of clinical trials could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for oncoprex and our other potential product candidates oncoprex has been tested in only one prior phase i clinical study involving  patients in that study oncoprex was tested as a monotherapy we believe that the best path for development is to develop a combination therapy of oncoprex in combination with erlotinib and possibly other drugs we have an ongoing phase iii clinical trial testing oncoprex in combination with erlotinib enrollment was completed in march  for the phase i portion of this clinical trial in which  patients were enrolled the phase ii portion of our phase iii clinical trial is at an early stage with a limited number of patients enrolled and the favorable results observed so far may not continue in the current clinical trial or be replicated in other clinical trials especially those involving larger numbers of patients even if the phase iii trial is successful success in early clinical studies may not be indicative of results obtained in later studies the results from our phase iii trial may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to support the submission of marketing approval for oncoprex before we request marketing approval the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical studies or evaluate subjects for an additional followup unless an accelerated approval process is allowed by the fda one or more phase iii studies is normally required for approval  table of contents delays in the commencement enrollment andor completion of clinical trials could increase our product development costs or delay or limit the regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates we do not know whether any future trials or studies of our other potential product candidates will begin on time or will be completed on schedule if at all the start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements  changes in the proposed regulatory approval pathway for a drug candidate  manufacturing challenges including delays or shortages in available drug product required clinical trial administrative actions slower than anticipated patient enrollment changing standards of care availability or prevalence of use of a comparative drug or required prior therapy clinical outcomes or financial constraints for instance delays or difficulties in patient enrollment or difficulties in retaining trial participants can result in increased costs longer development times or termination of a clinical trial clinical trials of a new product candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients including patients who are suffering from the disease the product candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria rates of patient enrollment are affected by many factors including the size of the patient population the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial that include the age and condition of the patients and the stage and severity of disease the nature of the protocol the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the availability of effective treatments andor availability of other investigational treatment options for the relevant disease as the second phase of a phase iii clinical trial md anderson researchers are conducting a phase ii clinical trial evaluating oncoprex in combination with erlotinib in nsclc enrollment eligibility criteria for this clinical trial are broad and include stage iv and recurrent nsclc not potentially curable by radiotherapy or surgery whether or not the patients have received prior chemotherapy and whether or not they have an activating egfr mutation the phase ii trial began in june  and is ongoing at md anderson ten patients have been entered and nine are evaluable for response under the trial protocol because they have received  or more cycles of treatment preliminary analysis of the data from these patients further supported our belief that oncoprex may provide medical benefit in several subpopulations of nsclc patients for which there is an unmet medical need and may provide pathways for accelerated approval as a result of these initial findings in april  we suspended enrollment of new patients in this phase ii clinical trial to collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek fda guidance as to whether the protocol for this clinical trial could be modified to expand enrollment and also to divide the patients into cohorts with a view toward seeking accelerated approval in one or more of these cohort populations we have completed the collection and analysis of the additional preliminary data and expect to present our findings to the fda within the next several months although the clinical trial is currently closed to new patient enrollment it is not terminated and is considered “ongoing” because activities such as patient followup and further data collection and analysis continue if we reach an agreement with the fda regarding expanded patient enrollment and defined patient cohorts then we plan to amend the trial protocol accordingly and proceed with the amended protocol at md anderson and several additional clinical trial sites amendments to the phase ii clinical trial protocol will require approval of the investigational review board or irb of each site where the amended trial is conducted if we do not reach an agreement with the fda on these changes then we plan to reopen enrollment in the current version of the phase ii trial at md anderson and at additional clinical trial sites in that event we will need to provide md anderson with plans and funding to move ahead with the trial whether under the original protocol or a revised protocol we intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to add additional clinical trial sites a product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical and clinical development the historical failure rate for product candidates is high due to scientific feasibility safety efficacy changing standards of medical care and other variables the results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the product candidate we the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons including but not limited to a belief that subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects or other adverse initial experiences or findings we may not have the financial resources to continue development of or to enter into collaborations for a product candidate if we experience any problems or other unforeseen events that delay or prevent regulatory approval of or our ability to commercialize product candidates including • inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial • inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with current or prospective contract research organizations or cros and trial sites the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different cros and trial sites • negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or abandon a program  table of contents • serious and unexpected drugrelated side effects experienced by subjects in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our current and potential product candidates • conditions imposed by the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials • delays in enrolling research subjects in clinical trials • high dropout rates and high fail rates of research subjects • inadequate supply or quality of product candidate components or materials or other supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials • greater than anticipated clinical trial costs • poor effectiveness of our current and potential product candidates during clinical trials or • unfavorable fda or other regulatory agency inspection and review of a clinical trial site or vendor we may have difficulty engaging or retaining clinical trial sites andor enrolling patients in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent development of our current and potential product candidates identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our current and potential product candidates is critical to our success the timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can engage and retain clinical trial sites and recruit patients to participate in testing our current and potential product candidates we have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials in the past due to difficulties with enrollment and we may experience similar delays in the future we have suspended enrollment of new patients in the phase ii portion of our phase iii clinical trial evaluating oncoprex in combination with erlotinib in nsclc and we may experience difficulties with enrollment upon reopening enrollment for the trial under the current protocol or a modified protocol if patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events in the industry or in the trials for other third party product candidates or for other reasons including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations the timeline for engaging sites recruiting patients conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed these delays could result in increased costs delays in advancing our product development delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether we or our clinical trial sites may not be able to identify recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients or those with the required or desired characteristics in a clinical trial to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner patient enrollment is affected by factors including  • severity of the disease under investigation • design of the clinical trial protocol including the fact that certain of our clinical trials are randomized to current treatments • size of the patient population • eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question • perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study • general level of excitement for the treatment approach • comments on social media • proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients • availability of competing therapies and clinical trials • efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials • patient referral practices of physicians and • ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment  table of contents we currently plan to seek initial marketing approval in the united states and subsequently in europe we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the fda or the european medicines agency or ema or other regulatory agencies our ability to successfully initiate enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries including • difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with cros and physicians • different standards for the conduct of clinical trials • our inability to locate qualified local consultants physicians and partners and • the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws medical standards and regulatory requirements including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments if we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned we may need to delay limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials any of which would have an adverse effect on our business any product candidate we advance through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval clinical failure can occur at any stage of our clinical development clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide or regulators may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies in addition data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do which may delay limit or prevent regulatory approval success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that subsequent clinical trials will generate the same or similar results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate thirtyone patients were treated in our first phase i clinical trial of oncoprex used as a monotherapy and  patients have been enrolled to date out of a possible total of  in our current phase iii clinical trial of oncoprex in combination with erlotinib in nsclc of the  patients  were enrolled in the phase i portion of the phase iii trial  and three of these  are also enrolled in the phase ii portion safety and efficacy results to date may not continue to be obtained as additional patients are treated and may not be duplicated in future clinical trials a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry including those with greater resources and experience than ours have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials in addition the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced we may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval further clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts if oncoprex is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for it and our business would be harmed in some instances there can be significant variability in safety andor efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors including changes in trial protocols differences in composition of the patient populations adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants we do not know whether any clinical trials we or any of our potential future collaborators may conduct will demonstrate the consistent or adequate efficacy and safety that would be required to obtain regulatory approval and market any products if we are unable to bring oncoprex to market or to acquire other products that are on the market or can be developed our ability to create stockholder value will be limited even if we obtain regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates the products may not gain market acceptance among physicians patients hospitals cancer treatment centers thirdparty payors and others in the medical community ethical social and legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use even with the requisite approvals the commercial success of our current and potential product candidates will depend in part on the medical community patients and thirdparty payors accepting gene therapy products in general and our current and potential product candidates in particular as medically useful costeffective and safe any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community if these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable the degree of market acceptance of these product candidates if approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors including  table of contents • the clinical indications for which our current and potential product candidates are approved • physicians hospitals cancer treatment centers and patients considering our current and potential product candidates as a safe and effective treatment • the potential and perceived advantages of our current and potential product candidates over alternative treatments • the prevalence and severity of any side effects • product labeling or product insert requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities • limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the fda • the timing of market introduction of our current and potential product candidates as well as competitive products • the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments • the availability of adequate coverage reimbursement and pricing by thirdparty payors and government authorities • the willingness of patients to pay outofpocket in the absence of coverage by thirdparty payors including government authorities • the willingness ability and availability of healthcare providers that can comply with the transportation handling and temperaturecontrolled storage requirements associated with our current and potential product candidates • relative convenience and ease of administration including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies and • the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched our efforts to educate the medical community and thirdparty payors on the benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors and may be restricted by the allowed label our current and potential product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or if approval is received require them to be taken off the market require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales in our phase i clinical trial of oncoprex as a monotherapy the only serious adverse events defined as grade   or  events under the common terminology criteria for adverse events or ctcae published by the us department of health and human services were grade  fever and grade  hypotension and the only doselimiting toxicities were two episodes of transient grade  hypophosphatemia abnormally low levels of phosphate in the blood the phase i portion of our phase iii trial combining oncoprex with erlotinib was a dose escalation study with the primary purpose of determining the mtd dose limiting toxicities were defined as grade   or  events during the first cycle of treatment that were considered to be treatment related at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg one subject had grade  adverse events of fatigue muscle weakness and hyponatremia low sodium level considered to be related to the study treatment erlotinib therefore three additional subjects were treated at this dose level six subjects total none of whom suffered a dose limiting toxicity  at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg there were no dose limiting toxicities  at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg one subject had a grade  rash considered to be related to the study treatment erlotinib therefore an additional three subjects were treated at this dose level six subjects total  no additional subjects suffered a dose limiting toxicity at dose level   at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg there were no dose limiting toxicities thus dose level  was determined to be the mtd none of the  subjects treated to date in the phase ii portion of the phase iii trial suffered a dose limiting toxicity  table of contents additional or unforeseen side effects from oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates could arise either during clinical development or if approved after the approved product has been marketed a showing that oncoprex or any other product candidate causes undesirable or unacceptable side effects could interrupt delay or halt clinical trials and result in the failure to obtain or suspension or termination of marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory authorities or result in marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory authorities only with restrictive label warnings if any of our current and potential product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by such products • regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements specific warnings a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies • we may be required to change instructions regarding the way the product is administered conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product • we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product • sales of the product may decrease significantly • regulatory authorities may require us to take our approved product off the market • we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims and • our reputation may suffer any of these events could prevent us or our potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products we may face product liability claims in the event oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates is approved for marketing by the fda and other regulatory authorities we may face potential product liability if successful claims are brought against us we may incur substantial liability and costs if the use of our current and potential product candidates harms patients or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our current and potential product candidates our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims our internal computer systems or those used by our cros contractors or consultants may fail or suffer security breaches despite the implementation of security measures our internal computer systems and those of our cros contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access as well as being vulnerable to other system difficulties failures or disruptions if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations for example the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our current and potential product candidates could be delayed business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our operations and those of our cros contractors and consultants could be subject to power shortages telecommunications failures wildfires water shortages floods earthquakes hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our current and potential product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of our contract manufacturers are affected by a manmade or natural disaster or other business interruption unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter in particular we do not carry product liability insurance covering any clinical trials liability that we may incur although we intend to obtain such insurance before we market any product there can be no assurance that we will secure adequate insurance coverage or that any such insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect our operations to significant potential liability in the future any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations  table of contents we face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change we have competitors in the united states europe and elsewhere including major multinational pharmaceutical companies established biotechnology companies specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies and universities and other research institutions many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources such as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing obtaining regulatory approvals recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products these companies also have significantly greater research sales and marketing capabilities and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to inlicense novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete as a result of these factors our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection andor fda approval or discovering developing and commercializing drugs for the cancer indications that we are targeting before we do or may develop drugs that are deemed to be more effective or gain greater market acceptance than ours smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large established companies in addition many universities and private and public research institutes may become active in our target disease areas our competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop which could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive there are a number of drugs approved and under development for treatment of lung cancer treatments competitive with our primary product candidates generally fall into the following categories chemotherapies such as cisplatin carboplatin docetaxel and pemetrexed targeted therapies such as erlotinib gefitinib  afatinib and osimertinib marketed as tagrisso® by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and car and car t cells and oncolytic virusbased technology data indicate that oncoprex when combined with certain targeted therapies and immunotherapies may enhance the benefit of those therapies therefore we believe that oncoprex could be administered in combination with targeted therapies and immunotherapies and thus may not be a direct competitor of those drugs in addition new drug candidates are constantly being conceived and developed any such competing therapy may be more effective andor costeffective than ours if our competitors market products that are more effective safer or less expensive or that reach the market sooner than our future products if any we may not achieve commercial success in addition because of our limited resources it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology if we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change we may be unable to compete effectively technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete less competitive or not economical risks related to regulatory approval and marketing of our current and potential product candidates and other legal compliance matters we cannot be certain that oncoprex will receive regulatory approval and without regulatory approval we will not be able to market oncoprex our business currently depends largely on the successful development and commercialization of oncoprex our ability to generate revenue related to product sales if ever will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of oncoprex for the treatment of cancer even if we complete the necessary clinical studies we cannot predict when or if we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate further if we do obtain regulatory approval it may only apply to a more narrow indication than we expect even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny we currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products the development of a product candidate and issues relating to its approval and marketing are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and regulatory authorities in other countries with regulations differing from country to country we are not permitted to market our current and potential product candidates in the united states until we receive approval of a biologics license application or bla from the fda we have not submitted any marketing applications for any of our current and potential product candidates  table of contents blas must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness for each desired indication blas must also include significant information regarding the chemistry manufacturing and controls for the product obtaining approval of a bla is a lengthy expensive and uncertain process and we may not be successful in obtaining approval the fda review processes can take years to complete and approval is never guaranteed if we submit a bla to the fda the fda must decide whether to accept or reject the submission for filing we cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the fda regulators in other jurisdictions have their own procedures for approval of product candidates even if a product is approved the fda may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and timeconsuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states and europe also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply with prior to marketing in those countries obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in any other country in addition delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications in the united states europe or other countries may be based upon many factors including regulatory requests for additional analyses reports data preclinical studies and clinical trials regulatory questions regarding different interpretations of data and results changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the emergence of new information regarding our current and potential product candidates or other products also regulatory approval for any of our current and potential product candidates may be withdrawn if we are unable to obtain approval from the fda or other regulatory agencies for oncoprex or if subsequent to approval we are unable to successfully commercialize oncoprex or our other potential product candidates we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to continue our operations in addition the clinical trial requirements of the fda the european medicines agency or ema and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type complexity novelty and intended use and market of the potential products the regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future for example in january  the fda oncology center of excellence or the center of excellence was created to leverage the combined skills of regulatory scientists and reviewers with expertise in drugs biologics and devices including diagnostics while the center of excellence is designed to help expedite the development of oncology and malignant hematologyrelated medical products and support an integrated approach in the clinical evaluation of drugs biologics and devices for the treatment of cancer the new center of excellence may initially create confusion within the fda and especially in the center of biologics and research that is the primary review division for oncoprex gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant dna research from the us national institutes of health or the nih are also subject to review by the nih office of biotechnology activities’ recombinant dna advisory committee or the rac although the fda decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed the rac review process can impede the initiation of a clinical trial even if the fda has reviewed the study and approved its initiation conversely the fda can put an investigational new drug application or ind on a partial or complete clinical hold even if the rac has provided a favorable review also before a clinical trial can begin at an nihfunded institution that institution’s institutional review board or irb and its institutional biosafety committee will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the study in addition adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the fda or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for performing studies or for obtaining approval of any of our current and potential product candidates these regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process require us to perform additional studies increase our development costs lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our current and potential product candidates or lead to significant postapproval limitations or restrictions as we advance our current and potential product candidates we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines delay or failure to obtain or unexpected costs in obtaining the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient revenue to maintain our business  table of contents if the fda does not find the manufacturing facilities of our future contract manufacturers acceptable for commercial production we may not be able to commercialize any of our current and potential product candidates we do not intend to manufacture the pharmaceutical products that we plan to sell we are currently utilizing contract manufacturers for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and the formulation of drug product for the trials of oncoprex currently being conducted or will need to be conducted prior to seeking regulatory approval however we do not have agreements for supplies of oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates and we may not be able to reach agreements with these or other contract manufacturers for sufficient supplies to commercialize oncoprex if it is approved additionally the facilities used by any contract manufacturer to manufacture oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates must be the subject of a satisfactory inspection before the fda approves the product candidate manufactured at that facility we are completely dependent on these thirdparty manufacturers for compliance with the requirements of us and nonus regulators for the manufacture of our finished products if our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our specifications and the fda’s current good manufacturing practices or cgmp standards and other requirements of any governmental agency to whose jurisdiction we are subject our current and potential product candidates will not be approved or if already approved may be subject to recalls reliance on thirdparty manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our current and potential product candidates including • the possibility that we are unable to enter into a manufacturing agreement with a third party to manufacture our current and potential product candidates • the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control and • the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties before we are able to arrange for a qualified replacement thirdparty manufacturer any of these factors could cause the delay of approval or commercialization of our current and potential product candidates cause us to incur higher costs or prevent us from commercializing our current and potential product candidates successfully furthermore if any of our current and potential product candidates are approved and contract manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished product on a timely basis at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue it may take several years to establish an alternative source of supply for our current and potential product candidates and to have any such new source approved by the government agencies that regulate our products we may be subject directly or indirectly to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws false claims laws and other federal and state healthcare laws and the failure to comply with such laws could result in substantial penalties our employees independent contractors consultants principal investigators cros commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements we are exposed to the risk of fraud misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees independent contractors consultants principal investigators cros commercial partners and vendors misconduct by these parties could include intentional reckless andor negligent conduct that fails to comply with the laws of the fda and similar foreign regulatory bodies provide true complete and accurate information to the fda and similar foreign regulatory bodies comply with manufacturing standards we have established comply with federal and state data privacy security fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the united states and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us if we obtain fda approval for any of our current and potential product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the united states our potential exposure under such laws would increase significantly and our costs associated with compliance with such laws would likely also increase these laws may impact among other things our current activities with principal investigators and research patients as well as proposed and future sales marketing and education programs in particular the promotion sales and marketing of healthcare items and services as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion including offlabel uses of our products structuring and commissions certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations additionally we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct even if none occurred if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of fines or other sanctions the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to  table of contents • the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or paying any remuneration including any kickback bribe or rebate directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation • federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws including the civil false claims act which impose criminal and civil penalties through government civil whistleblower or qui tam actions on individuals and entities for among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment or approval from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors that are false fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government in addition the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims act • the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa which imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any of the money or property owned by or under the custody or control of any healthcare benefit program regardless of the payor eg public or private willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services relating to healthcare matters similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation • hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of  or hitech and their respective implementing regulations which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation use maintenance or disclosure of individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization • the federal physician payment transparency requirements sometimes referred to as the “physician payments sunshine act” created under the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the affordable care act and its implementing regulations which require certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program with certain exceptions to report annually to the united states department of health and human services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members • the us federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdca which prohibits among other things the adulteration or misbranding of drugs and medical devices and • federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers additionally we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above among others some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs it is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of civil criminal and administrative penalties damages disgorgement monetary fines possible exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations in addition the approval and commercialization of any of our current and potential product candidates outside the united states will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above among other foreign laws  table of contents coverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our current and potential product candidates if approved which could make it difficult for us to sell our current and potential product candidates profitably the commercial success of any current or future product candidate will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients insurance companies and other third party payors and others in the medical community even if we obtain approval to commercialize our current and potential product candidates outside of the united states a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially affect our business due to the novel nature of our technology we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement for our current and potential product candidates the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue if market opportunities for our current and potential product candidates are smaller than we believe they are our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer successful sales of our products if our current and potential product candidates are approved depend on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors in addition because our current and potential product candidates represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer we cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for or accurately estimate the potential revenue from our current and potential product candidates patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on thirdparty payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance government authorities and other thirdparty payors such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement coverage and reimbursement by a thirdparty payor may depend upon a number of factors including but not limited to the thirdparty payor’s determination that use of a product is • a covered benefit under its health plan • safe effective and medically necessary • appropriate for the specific patient • costeffective and • neither experimental nor investigational in the united states no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among thirdparty payors and coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor as a result obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other thirdparty payor is a timeconsuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific clinical and costeffectiveness data for the use of our products and to justify the level of coverage and reimbursement relative to other therapies with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained third party payors may also have difficulty in determining the appropriate coverage of oncoprex and our other potential product candidates that are combination products if approved due to the fact that they are combination products that include another drug to the extent there are any delays in determining such coverage or inadequate coverage and reimbursement for all aspects of our combination therapies it would adversely affect the market acceptance demand and use of our current and potential product candidates any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from medicare or other government programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors which may adversely affect our future profitability we intend to seek approval to market our current and potential product candidates in both the united states and in selected foreign jurisdictions if we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for our current and potential product candidates we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions in some foreign countries particularly those in the european union the pricing of biologics is subject to governmental control and other market regulations which could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our current and potential product candidates in these countries pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate in addition market acceptance and sales of our current and potential product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our current and potential product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures  table of contents healthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations thirdparty payors whether domestic or foreign or governmental or commercial are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs in both the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably in particular in  the affordable care act was enacted in the united states the affordable care act and its implementing regulations among other things subjected biological products to potential competition by lowercost biosimilars revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs and certain biologics including our current and potential product candidates under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated increased the minimum medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program extended the medicaid drug rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research the current presidential administration and us congress may seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the affordable care act there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the affordable care act as a result there have been delays in the implementation of and action taken to repeal or replace certain aspects of the affordable care act while the extent to which any such changes may affect our business is uncertain steps have been taken to repeal and replace certain aspects of the affordable care act there have been and likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare we cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future the continuing efforts of the government insurance companies managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare andor impose price controls may adversely affect • the demand for our current and potential product candidates if we obtain regulatory approval • our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products • our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability • the level of taxes that we are required to pay and • the availability of capital we and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our products the manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity we are currently utilizing contract manufacturers for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and the formulation of drug product for our trials of oncoprex however we do not have agreements for supplies of oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates each supplier may require licenses to manufacture such components if such processes are not owned by the supplier or in the public domain and we may be unable to transfer or sublicense the intellectual property rights we may have or later obtain with respect to such activities all entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale including our existing contract manufacturers for oncoprex are subject to extensive regulation components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in latestage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cgmp these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures including record keeping and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our current and potential product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing we or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a bla on a timely basis and must adhere to the fda’s good laboratory practices or glp and cgmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our thirdparty contractors must pass a preapproval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates or any of our other potential products in addition the regulatory authorities may at any time audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our current and potential product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted if these facilities do not pass a preapproval plant inspection fda approval of the products may not be granted the regulatory authorities also may at any time following approval of a product for sale audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty contractors if any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly andor timeconsuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business  table of contents if we or any of our thirdparty manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance the fda can impose regulatory sanctions including among other things refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product or revocation of a preexisting approval as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed additionally if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a bla supplement which could result in further delay the regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines these factors could cause the delay of clinical trials regulatory submissions required approvals or commercialization of our current and potential product candidates cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully furthermore if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue if we fail to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business we may become subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the use manufacture storage handling and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products including numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations such as those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our operations may in the future involve the use of hazardous materials including chemicals and biological materials our operations may also produce hazardous waste products we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these current or future laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions risks related to our dependence on third parties we may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development and commercialization collaborations which could adversely affect our ability to develop certain of our current and potential product candidates and our financial condition and operating results because developing pharmaceutical products conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approval establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products are expensive we may enter into collaborations with companies that have the required expertise additionally if any of our current and potential product candidates receives marketing approval we may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties if we are unable to enter into arrangements on acceptable terms if at all we may be unable to effectively market and sell our products in our target markets we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators moreover collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of our current and potential product candidates when we collaborate with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party one or more of our collaboration partners may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our current and potential product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization the terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may contain provisions that are not favorable to us in addition any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our current and potential product candidates in some cases we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a product candidate or research program under a collaboration arrangement and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development if we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators for our current and potential product candidates we would face increased costs we may be forced to limit the number of our current and potential product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them as a result we might fail to commercialize products or programs for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found if we fail to achieve successful collaborations our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected  table of contents we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct supervise and monitor our clinical trials and if these third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner it may harm our business we rely on cros and clinical trial sites to ensure our clinical trials are conducted properly and on time while we have agreements governing their activities we may have limited influence over their actual performance we control only certain aspects of our cros’ activities nevertheless we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol legal regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the cros does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities we and our cros are required to comply with the gcps for conducting recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected the fda enforces these gcps through periodic inspections of study sponsors principal investigators and clinical trial sites if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable gcps the clinical data generated in our future clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications upon inspection the fda may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with gcps in addition our ongoing and future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our current and potential product candidates accordingly if our cros fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients we may be required to repeat such clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process our cros are not our employees and we are not able to directly monitor whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and nonclinical programs these cros may also have relationships with other commercial entities including our competitors for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations fail to meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons our clinical trials may be extended delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our current and potential product candidates as a result our financial results and the commercial prospects for our current and potential product candidates would be harmed our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to distribute manufacture and perform release testing for our current and potential product candidates and other key materials and if such third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our current and potential product candidates we intend to continue to rely on thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations or cmos to produce our current and potential product candidates and other key materials and on thirdparty contract testing organizations or ctos for the establishment and performance of validated product release assays but we have not entered into binding agreements with any such cmos or ctos to support commercialization additionally any cmo may not have experience producing our current and potential product candidates at commercial levels and may not achieve the necessary regulatory approvals or produce our products at the quality quantities locations and timing needed to support commercialization we may change our manufacturing process and there can be no guarantee that the regulatory authorities will approve any new process in a timely manner or ever also as a consequence of the manufacturing change there may be a requirement to do more preclinical safety or efficacy studies develop new manufacturing and release assays andor repeat all or part of the ascending dose safety study in animals or humans regulatory requirements ultimately imposed could adversely affect our ability to test manufacture or market products although we intend to rely on thirdparty manufacturers for commercialization we currently utilize a solesource manufacturer to support our clinical trials we may be unable to negotiate binding agreements with this manufacturer or additional manufacturers to support our commercialization activities at commercially reasonable terms no manufacturer we know of currently has the experience or ability to produce our current and potential product candidates at reasonable commercial levels or under full commercial requirements we may encounter technical or scientific issues related to manufacturing or development that we may be unable to resolve in a timely manner or with available funds further we have not completed the characterization and validation activities necessary for commercial and regulatory approvals if our manufacturing and testing partners do not obtain such regulatory approvals our commercialization efforts may be harmed  table of contents even if we timely develop a manufacturing process for oncoprex and successfully transfer it to thirdparty manufacturers if such thirdparty manufacturers are unable to produce our current and potential product candidates in the necessary quantities or in compliance with current good manufacturing practices or cgmp or in compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements and within our planned time frame and cost parameters the development and sales of our products if approved may be materially harmed the facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our current and potential product candidates must be approved by the fda pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our bla to the fda we do not control the manufacturing process of and are completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cgmps for the manufacture of our current and potential product candidates if our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the fda or others they will not be able to secure andor maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities in addition we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control quality assurance and qualified personnel if the fda or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our current and potential product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities which would significantly affect our ability to develop obtain regulatory approval for or market our current and potential product candidates if approved in addition any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws regulations and standards could subject us to the risk that we may have to suspend the manufacturing of our current and potential product candidates or that obtained approvals could be revoked which would adversely affect our business and reputation in addition any significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business we source key materials devices and equipment from third parties either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers there is a small number of suppliers for certain key materials and components that are used to manufacture our current and potential product candidates such suppliers may not sell these key materials to our manufacturers at the times or quantities we need them or on commercially reasonable terms we may not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers we also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute our products for our clinical trials any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our current and potential product candidates or commercialization of our products if approved producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue we have completed and may in the future complete related party transactions that were not and may not be conducted on an arm’s length basis our leading drug candidate oncoprex is based upon patents and related technology covered by a patent and technology license agreement between the university of texas md anderson cancer center or md anderson and introgen therapeutics inc such technology license agreement is referred to as the “ md anderson license agreement ” under which we have rights to patents covering use of various genes including the tusc gene for treatment of cancer as well as knowhow and related intellectual property in  the md anderson license agreement was sublicensed by introgen therapeutics inc to introgen research institute inc a texas corporation iri and in  this sublicense was assigned by iri to us  and we granted back to iri a nonexclusive royaltyfree license to use and practice the licensed technology for noncommercial research purposes as consideration for this assignment we agreed to assume all of iri’s obligations to md anderson under the md anderson license agreement  including ongoing patent related expenses and royalty obligations iri also agreed in  to provide additional technology licensing opportunities and services to us in return for monthly payments and our obligation to pay to iri a royalty of one percent  on sales of products licensed to us under the md anderson license agreement we also granted a nonexclusive royaltyfree sublicense to iri in  for noncommercial research purposes iri’s obligations to provide additional technology licensing opportunities and services to us and our obligation to make monthly payments to iri were terminated in  however our obligation to pay the one percent  royalty to iri upon sales of products licensed to us under the md anderson license agreement is ongoing this royalty obligation continues for  years after the later of the termination of the md anderson license agreement and the termination of the sublicense assigned by iri to us iri is controlled by rodney varner and his immediate family members mr varner is currently chairman of our board of directors having joined our board of directors on august   and has been our president and chief executive officer since august   accordingly in  and  when the above referenced agreements between iri and genprex were entered into mr varner was neither a member of our board of directors nor an executive officer of genprex when the  agreement was entered into  mr varner was deemed to be an “affiliate of the company due to his beneficial ownership of approximately  of our issued and outstanding shares although we believe that these transactions were conducted on an arm’s length basis it is possible that the terms were less favorable to us than they might have been in a transaction with an unrelated party we have adopted a written relatedperson transactions policy that sets forth our policies and procedures regarding the identification review consideration and oversight of relatedperson transactions  table of contents risks related to our intellectual property if we fail to obtain or protect our intellectual property our business will be impaired if we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our current and potential product candidates we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets third party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and end licenses if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors we could lose license rights that are important to our business we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents or our licensors which could be expensive timeconsuming andor unsuccessful obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements issued patents covering our current and potential product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or could expire before we obtain product approval the scope of our issued patents could be found to be narrower and provide less protection than we anticipate if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from md anderson or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with md anderson or other future licensors we could lose license rights that are important to our business under our license agreement with md anderson we hold a worldwide exclusive license to among other things manufacture and market products utilizing certain inventions that are critical to our business we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future our existing license agreement imposes various diligence royalty and other obligations on us  and we expect that future license agreements will impose various diligence milestone payment royalty and other obligations on us if we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or we are subject to a bankruptcy the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license see “business — license and collaboration agreements” for a description of our license agreements with md anderson which includes a description of the termination provisions of these agreements we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our current and potential product candidates we may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms if at all in that event we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology if we are unable to do so we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates which could harm our business significantly we cannot provide any assurances that thirdparty patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales or with respect to our sales an obligation on our part to pay royalties andor other forms of compensation to third parties in certain cases patent prosecution of our licensed technology may be controlled solely by the licensor if our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property in certain cases we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology in the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement including • the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretationrelated issues • the extent to which our technology and processes infringe intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement • the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships • our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations • the ownership of inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners and • the priority of invention of patented technology  table of contents if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates the intellectual property rights we have licensed from md anderson are subject to the rights of the us government the rights we have obtained pursuant to our license agreement with md anderson are made subject to the rights of the us government to the extent that the technology covered by the licensed intellectual property was developed under a funding agreement between md anderson and the us government additionally to the extent there is any conflict between our license agreement with md anderson and applicable laws or regulations applicable laws and regulations will prevail  similarly to the extent there is any conflict between our license agreement with md anderson and md anderson’s funding agreement with the us government the terms of the funding agreement will prevail some and possibly all of our licensed intellectual property rights from md anderson have been developed in the course of research funded by the us government as a result the us government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future products pursuant to the bayhdole act of  government rights in certain inventions developed under a governmentfunded program include a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or an assignee or exclusive licensee to such inventions to grant licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if the us government determines that adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention that government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs that government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations or that the right to use or sell such inventions is exclusively licensed to an entity within the us and substantially manufactured outside the us without the us government’s prior approval additionally we may be restricted from granting exclusive licenses for the right to use or sell our inventions created pursuant to such agreements unless the licensee agrees to additional restrictions eg manufacturing substantially all of the invention in the us the us government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits in addition the us government may acquire title in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits additionally certain inventions are subject to transfer restrictions during the term of these agreements and for a period thereafter including sales of products or components transfers to foreign subsidiaries for the purpose of the relevant agreements and transfers to certain foreign third parties if any of our intellectual property becomes subject to any of the rights or remedies available to the us government or third parties pursuant to the bayhdole act of  this could impair the value of our intellectual property and could adversely affect our business the us government has not exercised any of these rights or provided us with any notice of its intent to exercise any of these rights with respect to any of the intellectual property licensed to us by md anderson  we are not aware of any instance in which the us government has ever exercised any such rights with respect to any technologies or other intellectual property developed under funding agreements with the us government  if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates our competitive position could be harmed our commercial success will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the united states and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the united states and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation as a result the issuance scope validity enforceability and commercial value of our patents including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties are highly uncertain the steps we or our licensors have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights both inside and outside of the united states further the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue the rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents or those licensed to us and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking if we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected it is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them it is also possible that as research and development progresses the direction of our intellectual property strategy and patent portfolio will change resulting in strategic business decisions to allow certain patents or patent applications to be abandoned or lapse  table of contents with respect to patent rights we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications relating to any of our current and potential product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect our technology or products or if any of our licensors’ issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until  months after filing or in some cases not at all until they are issued as a patent therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship scope validity or enforceability issued patents that we have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the united states and abroad such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products protecting against the unauthorized use of our or our licensor’s patented technology trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive difficult and may in some cases not be possible in some cases it may be difficult or impossible to detect thirdparty infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights even in relation to issued patent claims and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties there is a substantial amount of litigation both within and outside the united states involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including patent infringement lawsuits interferences oppositions and inter partes reexamination proceedings before the us patent and trademark office or us pto and corresponding foreign patent offices numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications which are owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued the risk increases that our current and potential product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties third parties may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization there may be thirdparty patents or patent applications with claims to materials formulations methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our current and potential product candidates because patent applications can take many years to issue there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our current and potential product candidates may infringe in addition third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our current and potential product candidates or any final product itself the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire similarly if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations processes for manufacture or methods of use including combination therapy the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires in either case such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our current and potential product candidates defense of these claims regardless of their merit may involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement pay royalties redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure  table of contents we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and inlicenses presently we believe that we have rights to the intellectual property through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own to develop our current and potential product candidates because our programs may involve additional product candidates that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire inlicense or use these proprietary rights in addition our current and potential product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others we may be unable to acquire or inlicense any compositions methods of use processes or other thirdparty intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify the licensing and acquisition of thirdparty intellectual property rights is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire thirdparty intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we also may be unable to license or acquire thirdparty intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required thirdparty intellectual property rights our business financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights we may from time to time seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against infringers when we determine that a successful outcome is probable and may lead to an increase in the value of the intellectual property if we choose to enforce our patent rights against a party then that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced additionally the validity of our patents and the patents we have licensed may be challenged if a petition for post grant proceedings such as inter   partes review and post grant review is filed within the statutorily applicable time with the us pto these lawsuits and proceedings are expensive and would consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of such patents in addition there is a risk that the court will decide that such patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions there is also the risk that even if the validity of such patents is upheld the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party’s activities do not infringe our intellectual property rights in addition in recent years the us supreme court modified some tests used by the us pto in granting patents over the past  years which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood of a challenge of any patents we obtain or license if we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants outside scientific collaborators sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in addition others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position our reliance on third parties may require us to share our trade secrets which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed because we rely on third parties to manufacture our current and potential product candidates and because we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our current and potential product candidates we must at times share trade secrets with them we seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and if applicable material transfer agreements collaborative research agreements consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our manufacturers collaborators advisors employees and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information these agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information such as trade secrets despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others are used inappropriately to create new inventions or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements given that our proprietary position is based in part on our knowhow and trade secrets a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business  table of contents in addition these agreements typically restrict the ability of our collaborators advisors employees and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets our academic collaborators typically have rights to publish data provided that we are notified in advance and may delay publication for a specified time in order to secure our intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration in other cases publication rights are controlled exclusively by us although in some cases we may share these rights with other parties we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of research and development partnerships or similar agreements despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets our competitors may discover our trade secrets through breach of these agreements independent development or publication of information including our trade secrets in cases where we do not have proprietary or otherwise protected rights at the time of publication a competitor’s discovery of our trade secrets may impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors which could be expensive timeconsuming and unsuccessful competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors to counter infringement or unauthorized use we may be required to file infringement claims which can be expensive and timeconsuming in addition in an infringement proceeding a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid is unenforceable andor is not infringed or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question an adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and even if successful may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees we may not be able to prevent alone or with our licensors misappropriation of our intellectual property rights particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the united states furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation there could also be public announcements of the results of hearings motions or other interim proceedings or developments if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements periodic maintenance fees renewal fees annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents andor applications will be due to be paid to the us pto and various governmental patent agencies outside of the united states in several stages over the lifetime of the patents andor applications we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to nonus patent agencies the us pto and various nonus governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules however there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction in such an event our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business issued patents covering our current and potential product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court if we md anderson or one of our future licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our current and potential product candidates the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid andor unenforceable in patent litigation in the united states defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity andor unenforceability are commonplace grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements including lack of novelty obviousness or nonenablement grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the us pto or made a misleading statement during prosecution third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the united states or abroad even outside the context of litigation such mechanisms include reexamination post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions eg opposition proceedings such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our current and potential product candidates the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable with respect to the validity question for example we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity andor unenforceability we would lose at least part and perhaps all of the patent protection on our current and potential product candidates such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business  table of contents we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers we may in the future employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors although we try to ensure that our employees consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or knowhow of others in their work for us we may be subject to claims that we or our employees consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property including trade secrets or other proprietary information of any of our employee’s former employer or other third parties litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel which could adversely impact our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property we may be subject to claims that former employees collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property we may have potential ownership disputes arising for example from conflicting obligations of consultants collaborators or others who are involved in developing our current and potential product candidates litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights such as exclusive ownership of or right to use valuable intellectual property such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees changes in us patent law could diminish the value of patents in general thereby impairing our ability to protect our products the united states has enacted and is currently implementing wideranging patent reform legislation recent us supreme court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained depending on decisions by the us congress the federal courts and the us pto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future we have not yet registered the trademark for oncoprex and failure to secure such registration could adversely affect our business we have applied for but have not yet received approval of a registered trademark for oncoprex during trademark registration proceedings we may receive rejections although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections we may be unable to overcome such rejections in addition in the us pto and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings moreover any name we propose to use with our current and potential product candidates in the united states must be approved by the fda regardless of whether we have registered it or applied to register it as a trademark the fda typically conducts a review of proposed product names including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names if the fda objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the fda we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world filing prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the united states can be less extensive than those in the united states in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the united states consequently we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the united states or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the united states or other jurisdictions competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the united states these products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing  table of contents many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other intellectual property protection particularly those relating to biotechnology products which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license risks related to employee matters and managing growth we have no sales marketing or distribution experience and we will have to invest significant resources to develop those capabilities or enter into acceptable thirdparty sales and marketing arrangements we have no sales marketing or distribution experience to develop sales distribution and marketing capabilities we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources some of which will need to be committed prior to any confirmation that oncoprex or any of our other potential product candidates will be approved by the fda for product candidates for which we decide to perform sales marketing and distribution functions ourselves or through third parties we could face a number of additional risks including that we or our thirdparty sales collaborators may not be able to build and maintain an effective marketing or sales force and we may experience difficulty in managing the growth of our organization if we use third parties to market and sell our products we may have limited or no control over their sales marketing and distribution activities on which our future revenues may depend we will need to expand our operations and increase the size of our company and we may experience difficulties in managing growth as of june   we had four fulltime employees and one parttime employee as we advance our current and potential product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials we will need to increase our product development scientific and administrative headcount to manage these programs in addition to meet our obligations as a public company we may need to increase our general and administrative capabilities our management personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth if we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations our business may be adversely affected we may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants we may not be able to attract or retain qualified management finance scientific and clinical personnel and consultants due to the intense competition for qualified personnel and consultants among biotechnology pharmaceutical and other businesses if we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel and consultants to accomplish our business objectives we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy we are highly dependent on the development regulatory commercialization and business development expertise of our management team key employees and consultants any of our executive officers or key employees or consultants may terminate their employment at any time if we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees or consultants our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed replacing executive officers key employees and consultants may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully competition to hire and retain employees and consultants from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these additional key personnel and consultants our failure to retain key personnel or consultants could materially harm our business in addition we have scientific and clinical advisors and consultants who assist us in formulating our research development and clinical strategies these advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to or consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us and typically they will not enter into noncompete agreements with us if a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity we may lose their services in addition our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours  table of contents we may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success because we have limited resources we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement if we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships this may increase our capital requirements dilute our stockholders cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks we may evaluate and enter into various acquisitions and strategic partnerships including licensing or acquiring complementary products intellectual property rights technologies or businesses any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks including • increased operating expenses and cash requirements • the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities • the issuance of our equity securities • assimilation of operations intellectual property and products of an acquired company including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel • the diversion of our managements attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition • retention of key employees the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships • risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and marketing approvals and • our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology andor products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs in addition if we undertake acquisitions we may issue dilutive securities assume or incur debt obligations incur large onetime expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense moreover we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business risks related to our common stock and this offering there has been no public market for our common stock and an active market may not develop or be sustained which could limit your ability to sell shares of our common stock there currently is no public market for our common stock and our common stock will not be traded in the open market prior to this offering although we intend to list the common stock on the nasdaq capital market in connection with this offering an adequate trading market for the common stock may not develop or be sustained after this offering the initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between the underwriters and our board of directors and may not be representative of the market price at which our shares of common stock will trade after this offering in particular we cannot assure you that you will be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price  table of contents the best efforts structure of this offering may yield insufficient gross proceeds to fully execute on our business plan the underwriters are offering shares of our common stock in this offering on a best efforts basis the underwriters are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of common stock but will use their best efforts to sell the shares offered by us it is a condition to this offering that upon the closing of the offering our common stock would qualify for listing on the nasdaq capital market in order to list the nasdaq capital market requires that among other criteria at least  publiclyheld shares of our common stock be outstanding the shares be held in the aggregate by at least  round lot holders the market value of the publiclyheld shares of our common stock be at least  million our stockholders’ equity after giving effect to the sale of our shares in this offering be at least  million the bid price per share of our common stock be  or more and there be at least three registered and active market makers for our common stock as a “best efforts” offering there can be no assurance that we will successfully raise this minimum amount that the offering will satisfy the listing conditions required to trade our common stock on the nasdaq capital market or that the offering will ultimately be completed or will result in any proceeds being made available to us if we sell only the minimum number of shares yielding insufficient gross proceeds we may be unable to sufficiently fund our operations or fully execute on our business plan this could potentially result in a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations our management will have discretion over the use of the proceeds of the offering we intend to use the proceeds of this offering to complete our ongoing clinical trial to commence additional clinical trials to conduct biomarker studies to prepare submissions to the fda and for research and development and working capital and general corporate purposes our management however will have broad discretion in how we use these proceeds the proceeds could be applied in ways that do not improve our operating results or otherwise increase the value of their investments the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors including the following • adverse results or delays in preclinical or clinical trials • reports of adverse events in other gene therapy products or clinical trials of such products • inability to obtain additional funding • any delay in filing an ind or bla for any of our current and potential product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the fda’s review of that ind or bla • failure to develop successfully and commercialize our current and potential product candidates • failure to maintain our existing strategic collaboration or enter into new collaborations • failure by us or our licensors and strategic collaboration partners to prosecute maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights • changes in laws or regulations applicable to future products • inability to obtain adequate product supply for our current and potential product candidates or inability to do so at acceptable prices  table of contents • adverse regulatory decisions • introduction of new products services or technologies by our competitors • failure to meet or exceed financial projections we may provide to the public • failure to meet or exceed the financial projections of the investment community • the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public legislatures regulators and the investment community • announcements of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments by us our strategic collaboration partners or our competitors • disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights including patents litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies • additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel • significant lawsuits including patent or stockholder litigation • changes in the market valuations of similar companies • sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future and • trading volume of our common stock   in addition companies trading in the stock market in general and the nasdaq capital market in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance  table of contents nasdaq may delist our securities from its exchange which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions we have applied to list our common stock on the nasdaq capital market in order to make a final determination of compliance with their listing criteria nasdaq may look to the first trading day’s activity and particularly the last bid price on such day in the event the trading price for our common stock drops below the nasdaq capital market’s  minimum bid requirement nasdaq could rescind our initial listing approval if that were to happen the liquidity for our common stock would decrease which may substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock in addition we cannot assure you that in the future our securities will meet the continued listing requirements to be listed on the nasdaq capital market if the nasdaq capital market delists our common stock we could face significant material adverse consequences including • a limited availability of market quotations for our securities • a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock • a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company and • a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business financial condition and stock price global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in past years including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability we cannot assure you that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions if the current equity and credit markets deteriorate or do not improve it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult more costly and more dilutive failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans in addition there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value the initial public offering price is substantially higher than the net tangible book value of each outstanding share of our common stock purchasers of common stock in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution on a book value basis the dilution per share in the net tangible book value per share of common stock will be  per share if the minimum number of shares are sold and  per share if the maximum number of shares are sold based on an estimated  initial public offering price which is the midpoint of the offering price range and assuming for purposes of the dilution calculations contained in this prospectus if stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock are exercised there would be further dilution see “dilution” we have no intention of declaring dividends in the foreseeable future the decision to pay cash dividends on our common stock rests with our board of directors and will depend on our earnings unencumbered cash capital requirements and financial condition we do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future as we intend to use any excess cash to fund our operations investors in our common stock should not expect to receive dividend income on their investment and investors will be dependent on the appreciation of our common stock to earn a return on their investment  table of contents we are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the year in which we complete this offering although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  the last day of the fiscal year a following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least  billion or c in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer which requires the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates to exceed  million as of the prior june th and  the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company” which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and our periodic reports and proxy statements we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile under the jobs act emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies as a result changes in rules of us generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations we will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to existing and new compliance initiatives as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  or the exchange act which will require among other things that we file with the securities and exchange commission or the sec annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition in addition the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules subsequently adopted by the sec and the nasdaq capital market to implement provisions of the sarbanesoxley act impose significant requirements on public companies including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices further in july  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act was enacted there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the doddfrank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as “say on pay” and proxy access recent legislation permits emerging growth companies to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of this offering we intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses stockholder activism the current political environment and government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate we expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly if these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services for example we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage we cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements the impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as executive officers we may be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by sarbanesoxley act of  pursuant to sarbanesoxley act of  our management will be required to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm may in the future be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities if we fail to implement any required improvements to our disclosure controls and procedures we may be obligated to report control deficiencies and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in either case we could become subject to regulatory sanction or investigation further these outcomes could damage investor confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements  table of contents failure to continue improving our accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies as a public company we operate in a demanding regulatory environment which requires us to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of  and the related rules and regulations of the sec company responsibilities required by the sarbanesoxley act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud we may need to retain additional finance capabilities and build our financial infrastructure as a public company section a of the sarbanesoxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the sec however for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act we have and intend to continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act we may continue to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited under sections  and  of the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a cumulative change in its equity ownership by “percent shareholders” of greater than  percentage points by value over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to use its prechange net operating loss carryforwards or nols and certain other prechange tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset its postchange taxable income and taxes as applicable may be limited we have completed multiple rounds of financing since our inception which may have resulted in an ownership change or could result in an ownership change in the future we have not completed a section  and  analysis regarding any limitations on our nols and research and development credit carryforwards and such limitations could be significant we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our nols and research and development credit carryforwards to offset our us federal taxable income and taxes as applicable may be subject to limitations which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us in addition at the state level similar rules may apply and there may be periods during which the use of nols is suspended or otherwise limited which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall if our existing stockholders sell or indicate an intention to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the lockup and other legal restrictions on resale discussed in this prospectus lapse the market price of our common stock could decline based upon the number of shares of common stock on an asconverted basis outstanding as of june   upon the closing of this offering we will have outstanding a total of  shares of common stock assuming the maximum offering amount is raised in this offering of these shares as of the date of this prospectus approximately  shares of our common stock will be freely tradable without restriction in the public market immediately following this offering assuming that current stockholders do not purchase shares in this offering network  securities however may in its sole discretion permit our officers directors and other stockholders who are subject to these lockup agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lockup agreements the lockup agreements pertaining to this offering will expire  days from the date of this prospectus after the lockup agreements expire based upon the number of shares of common stock on an asconverted basis outstanding as of june   up to an additional  shares of common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market subject to rule  under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act in addition as of june    shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan or subject to outstanding warrants will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules the lockup agreements and rule  and rule  under the securities act if these additional shares of common stock are sold or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market the market price of our common stock could decline future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock including pursuant to our equity incentive plans could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall we intend to seek to raise additional funds and we may finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships in each case by issuing equity or convertible debt securities in addition to the shares issued in this offering which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders our board of directors has the authority in some instances without action or vote of the stockholders to issue our authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part our certificate of incorporation will be amended to authorize us to issue up to  shares of voting common stock and  shares of preferred stock future issuances of common or preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote and would be dilutive to earnings per share in addition any newly issued preferred stock could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of the common stock those rights preferences and privileges could include among other things the establishment of dividends that must be paid prior to declaring or paying dividends or other distributions to holders of our common stock or providing for preferential liquidation rights these rights preferences and privileges could negatively affect the rights of holders of our common stock and the right to convert such preferred stock into shares of our common stock at a rate or price that would have a dilutive effect on the outstanding shares of our common stock  table of contents initially the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to stock awards under our  plan is  shares additionally the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our  plan will automatically increase on january  of each year beginning on january   and continuing through and including january   by  of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on december  of the preceding calendar year or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year our stockholders may experience additional dilution which could cause our stock price to fall if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock then our stock price and trading volume could decline the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us our industry and our market if no analyst elects to cover us and publish research or reports about us the market for our common stock could be severely limited and our stock price could be adversely affected in addition if one or more analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline if one or more analysts who elect to cover us issue negative reports or adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock our stock price could decline the concentration of our common stock ownership by our current management may limit your ability to influence corporate matters upon completion of this offering our directors and executive officers will beneficially own and will be able to vote in the aggregate approximately  of our outstanding common stock if the minimum number of shares are sold and approximately  of our outstanding common stock if the maximum number of shares offered are sold as such our directors and executive officers as stockholders will continue to have the ability to exert significant influence over all corporate activities including the election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers mergers proxy contests or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares of common stock this concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and as a result we may take actions that purchasers in this offering do not view as beneficial in addition such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control in such cases the perception of our prospects in the market may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable our board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder might consider favorable these include provisions • requiring a majority vote of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws • provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors • provide that the board of directors or any individual director may only be removed with cause and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least  of the voting power of all of our then outstanding common stock • provide that all vacancies including newly created directorships may except as otherwise required by law be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office even if less than a quorum • divide our board of directors into three classes • require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent • provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice  table of contents • do not provide for cumulative voting rights therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election if they should so choose • provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board our chief executive officer or by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors and • provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring such an action in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such actions and may discourage such actions furthermore our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval any series of preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends liquidation rights and possibly voting rights the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock in addition delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that recently have acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors’ wishes under section  of the delaware general corporation law a delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances including by approval of the corporation’s

offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the offering price range we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering after deducting underwriting commissions and expenses payable by us and other offering expenses payable by us will be approximately  million if we sell a minimum of  shares  approximately  million if we sell  shares which is the midpoint between the minimum and maximum number of shares in the offering and approximately  million if we sell all  shares of our common stock in this offering however this is a best efforts offering and there is no assurance that we will sell any shares or receive any proceeds we intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows     assuming minimum offering     assuming midpoint of minimum and maximum offering

cannot guarantee future results events levels of activity performance or achievements overview genprex™ is a clinical stage gene therapy company developing a new approach to treating cancer based upon our novel proprietary technology platform including our initial product candidate oncoprex™ immunogene therapy  or oncoprex our platform technologies are designed to encapsulate cancer fighting genes into nanoscale hollow spheres called nanovesicles which are then administered intravenously and taken up by tumor cells where they express proteins that are missing or found in low quantities and modulate the immune environment to restore defective cancer fighting functions we hold an exclusive worldwide license from the university of texas md anderson cancer center or md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of a series of genes that have been shown in preclinical and clinical research to have cancer fighting properties researchers at md anderson have conducted a phase i clinical trial and the phase i portion of a phase iii clinical trial and are conducting the phase ii portion of that phase iii clinical trial in nonsmall cell lung cancer or nsclc md anderson researchers have collaborated with other researchers to identify other genes such as those in the p chromosomal region that may act as tumor suppressors or have other cancer fighting functions date from preclinical studies performed by others suggest that product candidates that could be derived from our technology platform could be effective against other types of cancer including breast head and neck renal cell kidney and soft tissue cancer  as well as nsclc therefore our platform technologies may allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer jobs act and recent accounting pronouncements the jobs act enacted in  provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and as a result we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies we have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may affect our financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   table of contents research and development costs we record accrued expenses for costs invoiced from research and development activities conducted on our behalf by thirdparty service providers which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities we record the costs of research and development activities based upon the amount of services provided and we include these costs in accrued liabilities in the balance sheets and within research and development expense in the statement of operations these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses we estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreedupon fee to be paid for such services we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period as actual costs become known we adjust our accrued estimates although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred our understanding of the status and timing of services performed the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period our accrued expenses are dependent in part upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other thirdparty service providers to date there have been no material differences from our accrued expenses to actual expenses income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized we have provided a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets which primarily consist of cumulative net operating losses from april   inception to march   due to our history of operating losses since inception and losses expected to be incurred in the foreseeable future a full valuation allowance was considered necessary impairment of longlived assets management reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable or at a minimum annually during the fourth quarter of the year if an evaluation is required the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying value to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value components of our results of operations and financial condition operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories research and development general and administrative and depreciation research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of · costs incurred to conduct research such as the discovery and development of our current and potential product candidates · costs related to production of clinical supplies including fees paid to contract manufacturers · fees paid to clinical consultants clinical trial sites and vendors including clinical research organizations in conjunction with implementing and monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating clinical trial data including all related fees such as patient screening fees laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis and · costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements we recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred clinical trial costs contract manufacturing and other development costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed  table of contents we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we advance our current and potential product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates in the united states and europe the process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and timeconsuming the actual probability of success for our current and potential product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including the quality of our current and potential product candidates early clinical data investment in our clinical program competition manufacturing capability and commercial viability we may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our current and potential product candidates as a result of the uncertainties discussed above we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our current and potential product candidates general and administrative  general and administrative expense consists of personnel related costs which include salaries as well as the costs of professional services such as accounting and legal facilities information technology and other administrative expenses we expect our general and administrative expense to increase following the completion of this offering due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as accounting

cash operational and liquidity requirements for at least  months if we sell a minimum of  shares and for at least  months if we sell all  shares of our common stock in this offering we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of obtain regulatory approval for and begin to commercialize one or more of our current and potential product candidates which we expect will take a number of years and which is subject to significant uncertainty accordingly we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our future operations until such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales if ever we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings and we may seek to raise additional capital through strategic collaborations however we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay limit reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop or market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations in part or in full furthermore even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations

into nanoscale hollow spheres called nanovesicles which are then administered intravenously and taken up by tumor cells where they express proteins that are missing or found in low quantities oncoprex has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells reestablishes pathways for apoptosis or programmed cell death in cancer cells and modulates the immune response against cancer cells oncoprex has also been shown to block mechanisms that create drug resistance we hold an exclusive worldwide license from the university of texas md anderson cancer center or md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of a series of genes that have been shown in preclinical and clinical research to have cancer fighting properties with oncoprex we are initially targeting nonsmall cell lung cancer or nsclc researchers at md anderson have conducted two phase i clinical trials and are currently conducting an ongoing phase ii clinical trial of oncoprex in nsclc according to the world health organization lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide killing more people than breast colon kidney liver prostate and skin cancers combined and is the second most common type of cancer each year there are over  million new lung cancer cases and  million deaths from lung cancer worldwide and in the united states there are over  new cases and more than  deaths from lung cancer per year nsclc represents  of all lung cancers according to a  american cancer society report the fiveyear survival rate for stage iv metastatic nsclc is about  and overall survival for lung cancer has not improved appreciably in the last  years we believe that there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatments for nsclc in the united states and globally and we believe that oncoprex may be suitable for a majority of nsclc patients we believe that our platform technologies could allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer our research and development pipeline shown in “our pipeline” below demonstrates our clinical and preclinical progress to date cancer results from genetic mutations mutations that lead to cancer are usually present in two major classes of genes oncogenes which are involved in functions such as signal transduction and transcription and tumor suppressor genes which play a role in governing cell proliferation by regulating transcription  transduction is the process by which chemical and physical signals are transmitted through cells transcription is the process by which a cell’s dna sequence is copied to make rna molecules which then play a role in protein expression in normal cells mutations in oncogenes are discovered and targeted for elimination by tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells the oncogene mutations may overwhelm the natural tumor suppression processes or those tumor suppression processes may be impaired or absent  functional alterations due to mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may result in the abnormal and uncontrolled growth patterns characteristic of cancer these genetic alterations facilitate such malignant growth by affecting signal transduction pathways and transcription thus inhibiting normal growth signaling in the cell circumventing the natural process of apoptosis evading the immune system’s response to cancer and inducing angiogenesis which is the formation of new blood vessels that supply cancer cells the most common genetic alterations present in nsclc are in tumor suppressor genes against which few targeted small molecule drugs have been developed each of the two sets of chromosomes in the cell nucleus includes two copies of each gene called alleles which may be identical or may show differences in most situations tumor suppressor genes require both alleles of a gene to be deleted or inactivated to impair tumor suppression activity and lead to tumor growth the replacement of just one functional allele may therefore be enough to restore the normal cellular functions of growth regulation and apoptosis among the genetic conditions associated with lung cancer are the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors or egfrs and mutations of kinases kinases are enzymes that play an important role in signal transduction through the modification of proteins by adding or taking away phosphate groups a process called dephosphorylation to change the proteins’ function when two egfr transmembrane proteins are brought to proximity on the cell membrane surface or dimerize either through a ligand or binding molecule that binds to the extracellular receptor or through some other process the intracellular proteinkinase domains can autophosphorylate and activate downstream processes including cell signaling pathways that can lead to either cell cycle arrest or cell growth and proliferation egfrs and kinases can act similarly to a switch that turns “on” and “off” when phosphate groups are either added or taken away mutated kinases can have a malfunctioning onoff switch causing the switch to be stuck in the “on” position or failing to turn the switch “off” leading to the loss of cell control  table of contents a subset of nsclc patients approximately  of nsclc patients of north american and european descent and approximately  to  of nsclc patients of asian descent carry an egfr mutation that makes their tumors sensitive to tkis such as erlotinib however even for these patients tumor resistance to tkis frequently develops within two years resulting in eventual disease progression erlotinib generally does not benefit nsclc patients who do not have this activating egfr mutation however our clinical and preclinical data have shown that the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib can increase antitumor activity even in cancers without the egfr mutations as well as in cancers that have become resistant to erlotinib for this reason we believe oncoprex may be suitable for the majority of nsclc patients cancer can spread when cells’ natural cancer suppression functions are impaired the tumor suppressor gene called tumor suppressor candidate  or tusc which was formerly known as fus has been shown to affect both cell proliferation and apoptosis tusc is a pankinase inhibitor which means that it has the ability to inhibit multiple kinase receptors such as egfr and plateletderived growth factor receptor or pdgfr tusc is frequently inactivated early in the development of lung cancer and loss of tusc expression in nsclc is associated with significantly worse overall survival compared to patients with normal tusc expression many types of cancer cells including approximately  of nsclc cells lack expression of tusc cancer can also spread when the body’s natural immune functions are impaired including by the cancer cells themselves pd or programmed death is a receptor expressed on the surface of activated t cells which are part of the body’s immune system pdl or programmed death ligand is a proteinreceptor expressed on the surface of cancer and other cells the binding of pd to pdl has been speculated to contribute to cancer cells’ ability to evade the body’s immune response  pd and molecules like it are called immune checkpoints because they can impede the normal immune response for example by blocking the t cells from attacking the cancer cells in many cancers pdl receptors are upregulated and substantial research is now being performed in the emerging field of immunooncology to discover drugs or antibodies that could block pdl and similar receptors it is believed that blocking the pdpdl interaction pathway and other similar checkpoints such as cytotoxic tlymphocyteassociated protein  or ctla with drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can prevent cancer cells from inactivating t cells our oncoprex immunogene therapy is designed to interrupt cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells and to target and kill cancer cells via receptor pathways and also to stimulate the natural immune responses against cancer oncoprex combines features of gene therapy and immunotherapy in that it upregulates tusc expression in the cell and also increases the antitumor immune cell population and downregulates pdl receptors thereby boosting the immune response to cancer oncoprex consists of a tusc gene encapsulated in a positively charged nanovesicle made from lipid molecules with a positive electrical charge oncoprex is injected intravenously and can specifically target cancer cells which generally have a negative electrical charge once oncoprex is taken up into a cancer cell the tusc gene is expressed into a protein that is capable of restoring certain defective functions arising in the cancer cell oncoprex nanovesicles are designed to deliver the functioning tusc gene to cancer cells while minimizing their uptake by normal tissue tumor biopsy studies conducted at md anderson show that the uptake of tusc in tumor cells after oncoprex treatment is  to  times the uptake in normal cells we believe that oncoprex unlike other gene therapies which either need to be delivered directly into tumors or require cells to be removed from the body reengineered and then reinserted into the body is the first systemic gene therapy to be used for cancer in humans our clinical and preclinical data indicate that oncoprex can be combined with the widely used anticancer drug erlotinib marketed as tarceva® by genentech inc in humans  erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or tki which uses a mechanism of action similar to that of pankinase inhibitors to block the action of tyrosine kinases which are a type of kinase involved in many cell functions including cell signaling growth and division in addition md anderson researchers have conducted preclinical studies combining oncoprex with · the tki gefitinib marketed as iressa® by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals in animals and in human nsclc cells · mk in animals mk is an inhibitor of akt kinases which affect cell signaling pathways downstream from tyrosine kinases · an antipd antibody equivalent to the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab marketed as opdivo® by bristolmyers squibb company in animals and · an antictla antibody equivalent to ipilimumab marketed as yervoy® by bristolmyers squibb company in animals  table of contents the manufacturers of the marketed drugs were not involved in any of our clinical or preclinical studies in studies involving marketed drugs the drugs were administered concurrently with oncoprex without being modified in any way and the antibodies used in our preclinical studies that did not use the marketed drugs were the nonhumanized equivalent to marketed drugs data from these clinical and preclinical studies indicate that combining oncoprex with these other therapies yields results more favorable than either these therapies or oncoprex alone with minimal side effects relative to other lung cancer drugs thereby potentially making oncoprex a therapy complementary to these cancer treatments in addition based on our clinical and preclinical studies and on preclinical studies conducted by others we believe that oncoprex could be combined with other lung cancer drugs that have similar mechanisms of action to the drugs mentioned above such as pembrolizumab marketed as keytruda® by merck  co nivolumab marketed as opdivo® by bristolmyers squibb company and atezolizumab marketed as tecentriq® by genentechroche researchers at md anderson have collaborated with other researchers to identify other genes such as those in the p chromosomal region that may act as tumor suppressors or have other cancer fighting functions we hold rights to certain of these genes under license agreements with md anderson  date from preclinical studies performed by others suggest that product candidates that could be derived from our technology platform could be effective against other types of cancer including breast head and neck renal cell kidney and soft tissue cancer as well as nsclc therefore our platform technologies may allow delivery of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer md anderson researchers have completed the first phase of a phase iii clinical trial of oncoprex in combination with erlotinib in patients with stage iv metastatic or recurrent nsclc that is not potentially curable by radiotherapy or surgery whether or not they have received prior chemotherapy and whether or not they have an activating egfr mutation  the phase i portion of the trial was a doseescalating study with primary endpoints of establishing the safety and tolerability of the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib and establishing the maximum tolerated dose or mtd the secondary endpoint of the phase i portion of the trial was to assess the toxicity of the combination of oncoprex with erlotinib in the phase i portion of the trial which began in   subjects were treated and the mtd was determined to be the highest tested dose  mgkg of oncoprex administered every  days and  mg of erlotinib per day toxicities were found to compare favorably with those of other lung cancer drugs the phase ii portion of the trial is designed to include subjects treated with the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib at the mtd with the primary goal of measuring the response rate and secondary endpoints of stable disease time to progression and overall survival the response rate for cancer therapies is defined under the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors or recist as complete response cr  partial response pr disease control rate is defined under the recist criteria as complete response cr  partial response pr  stable disease sdweeks enrollment criteria for the second phase of the phase iii clinical trial are identical to those in the first phase the phase ii portion of the trial began in june  and is ongoing at md anderson of the  patients allowed in the protocol for the phase ii portion of the trial  have been enrolled and nine are evaluable for response under the trial protocol because they have received  or more cycles of treatment interim results show that four of the patients had tumor regression and one patient had a complete response or cr under the recist criteria the patient with the cr had disappearance of the lung primary tumor as well as lung liver and lymph node metastases the median response duration for all patients which is defined as the median time between when response is first noted to the time when cancer progression is observed was three months the response rate for the nine patients evaluated to date was  and the disease control rate for the nine patients was  the response rate and disease control rate to date in the phase ii portion of our phase iii clinical trial substantially exceeds the response rate of  with no crs and disease control rate of  reported for a clinical trial of the tki afatinib marketed as gilotrif® by boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals inc in a study referred to as the luxlung  clinical trial a total of  patients were enrolled in that phase iibiii clinical trial whose primary endpoint was overall survival and whose secondary endpoints were progressionfree survival recist response quality of life and safety the luxlung  clinical trial was a randomized double blinded phase iibiii clinical trial treating subjects with stage iiib or iv adenocarcinoma a type of nsclc the phase ii portion of our phase iii trial is not blinded and is designed to treat nsclc subjects regardless of egfr status preliminary analysis of the early data from the phase ii portion of our phase iii trial supports our belief that oncoprex may provide medical benefit in several subpopulations of nsclc patients for which there is an unmet medical need and may provide pathways for accelerated approval by the us food and drug administration of fda as a result of these initial findings in april  we suspended enrollment of new patients in the phase ii portion of the trial to collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek fda guidance as to whether the protocol for this clinical trial could be modified to expand enrollment and also to divide the patients into cohorts with a view toward seeking accelerated approval in one or more of these cohort populations we have completed the collection and analysis of the additional preliminary data and expect to present our findings to the fda within the next several months although this clinical trial is currently closed to new patient enrollment it is not terminated and is considered “ongoing” because activities such as patient followup and further data collection and analysis continue  table of contents if we reach an agreement with the fda regarding expanded patient enrollment and defined patient cohorts then we plan to amend the trial protocol accordingly and proceed with the amended protocol at md anderson and several additional clinical trial sites amendments to the phase ii clinical trial protocol will require approval of the investigational review board or irb of each site where the amended trial is conducted if we do not reach an agreement with the fda on these changes then we plan to reopen enrollment in the current version of the phase ii portion of the trial at md anderson and at additional clinical trial sites in that event we will need to provide md anderson with plans and funding to move ahead with the trial whether under the original protocol or a revised protocol we intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to add additional clinical trial sites in  md anderson researchers completed a phase i clinical trial of oncoprex as a monotherapy  the primary objective of this phase i trial was to assess the toxicity of oncoprex administered intravenously and to determine the mtd and recommended phase ii dose of oncoprex alone secondary objectives were to assess the expression of tusc following intravenous delivery of oncoprex in tumor biopsies and also to assess the anticancer activity of oncoprex this trial demonstrated that oncoprex was well tolerated established the mtd and the therapeutic dosage for oncoprex at  mgkg administered every  days and showed that cancer growth was halted in a number of patients tumor regressions occurred in primary lung tumors and metastatic cancers in the liver pancreas and lymph nodes pre and posttreatment patient biopsies demonstrated that intravenous oncoprex selectively and preferentially targeted patients’ cancer cells and suggested that clinical anticancer activity was mediated by tusc we believe that oncoprex’ combination of pankinase inhibition direct induction of apoptosis anticancer immune modulation and complementary action with targeted drugs and immunotherapies is unique and positions oncoprex to provide treatment for patients with nsclc and possibly other cancers who are not benefitting from currently offered therapies our oncoprex immunogene therapy technology was discovered through a lung cancer research consortium from md anderson and the university of texas southwestern medical center or utswmc along with the national cancer institute or nci the tusc discovery teams included jack a roth md facs chairman of our scientific and medical advisory board we have assembled a team of experts in clinical and translational research including laboratory scientists medical oncologists and biostatisticians to pursue the development and commercialization of oncoprex and other potential product candidates our technology discoveries and research and development programs have been the subjects of numerous peerreviewed publications and have been supported by small business innovation research or sbir grants and grants from the national institutes of health the united states department of treasury and the state of texas we hold a worldwide exclusive license from md anderson to patents covering the therapeutic use of tusc and other genes that have been shown to have cancer fighting properties as well as a number of related technologies including  issued patents and six pending patent applications our pipeline we are developing oncoprex our lead product candidate to be administered with erlotinib for nsclc we are also conducting preclinical research with the goal of developing oncoprex to be administered with immunotherapies in nsclc  in addition we conducted research into other tumor suppressor genes associated with chromosome p our research and development pipeline is shown below  table of contents      table of contents our strategy we intend to develop and commercialize treatments for cancer based on our proprietary gene therapy platform alone or in combination with other cancer therapies key elements of our strategy include • conduct ongoing and new clinical trials  we plan to continue clinical trials of oncoprex immunogene therapy in combination with erlotinib for treatment of nsclc while exploring pathways to accelerated food and drug administration or fda approval of this combination in subpopulations of nsclc patients for whom there is currently no approved therapy we also plan to pursue a clinical trial of the combination of oncoprex with antipd immunotherapy we may also pursue additional clinical trials of the combination of oncoprex plus an immunotherapy called ctla immunotherapy as well as possible multidrug combinations of oncoprex with additional targeted therapies and immunotherapies • investigate the effectiveness of oncoprex in other cancers  we may also explore the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib in other cancers such as soft tissue kidney head and neck andor breast cancer and we may pursue development of additional proprietary genes alone or in combination with egfr tkis such as erlotinib andor with immunotherapies • prepare to commercialize oncoprex  we plan to continue to develop the manufacturing process development and other capabilities needed to commercialize oncoprex • pursue strategic partnerships  as we gather additional clinical data we plan to pursue strategic partnerships with other developers and providers of anticancer drugs to investigate possible therapeutic combinations of oncoprex with drugs manufactured by others to accelerate the development of our current and potential product candidates through codevelopment and to increase the commercial opportunities for our current and potential product candidates • develop our platform technology  we plan to investigate the applicability of our platform technology with additional anticancer drugs current treatment of cancer chemotherapy is the standard treatment for the majority of nsclc patients as it is for many cancer patients because it is a systemic rather than a targeted approach to treating cancer chemotherapy also kills healthy cells and has a number of other side effects a subset of nsclc patients carry one or both of two egfr mutations referred to as exon  deletion and exon  substitution which make their tumors sensitive to tkis because egfr is frequently overexpressed in lung tumors it has become a favored therapeutic target for pharmaceutical companies several pharmacological and biological approaches including tkis have been developed specifically to block activated egfr for cancer therapy the class of drugs functioning as protein kinase inhibitors or kis comprises the majority of targeted therapies for lung cancer accounting for most sales and use of the kis the tki drugs are the most common with drugs targeting egfr kinases leading the sector growth several egfr tki therapies are marketed commercially including market leader erlotinib gefitinib  afatinib and osimertinib a leading small molecule egfr tki is erlotinib which is approved in the us and europe as a firstline therapy in metastatic nsclc patients with an activating egfr mutation erlotinib was previously approved as a secondline treatment in patients with metastatic nsclc after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen erlotinib has been used to treat more than  lung cancer patients however while erlotinib is most effective in patients who have an activating egfr mutation and are therefore described as “egfr positive” it is significantly less effective in overall nsclc populations and is generally not effective in patients without an activating egfr mutation approximately  of nsclc patients of north american and european descent and approximately  to  of nsclc patients of asian descent have the activating egfr mutations this means that the majority of nsclc patients do not have activating egfr mutations and are therefore “egfr negative” and not optimal candidates for erlotinib and other tkis in addition even among those patients who are egfr positive and benefit from erlotinib therapy most eventually become resistant to and ultimately no longer respond to erlotinib therapy resulting in eventual disease progression furthermore clinical trials have shown that combining egfr tkis with conventional chemotherapy does not increase survival for lung cancer patients while next generation tkis show promise in targeting resistant egfr positive tumors that carry a mutation known as tm only about onehalf of egfr positive patients  to  of all nsclc patients of north american and european descent and  to  of nsclc patients of asian descent  carry the tm mutation this leaves a significant majority of nsclc patients – those who are egfr negative and those who are egfr positive but have become resistant to erlotinib and do not have the tm mutation – without a targeted therapy for their cancer  table of contents our clinical and preclinical data indicate that the combination of our lead product candidate oncoprex with erlotinib and other egfr tkis may increase antitumor activity in cancers with or without the egfr mutations and in cancers that have become resistant to erlotinib therapy thus expanding the number of patients who could benefit from those drugs tusc the active agent in oncoprex tusc which is the active agent in oncoprex is a multifunctional gene that plays a vital role in cancer suppression and normal cell regulation key tusc   anticancer mechanisms of action include the inactivation of multiple oncogenic kinases the induction of apoptosis the control of cell signaling and inflammation and modulation of the immune system to fight cancer oncoprex has also been shown to block mechanisms that create drug resistance our data indicate that oncoprex in combination with both egfr tkis and with immunotherapies achieve results more favorable than results achieved with either oncoprex or such other therapies alone and may make those drugs effective for patients who would not otherwise benefit from them normal tusc function is inactivated at the early onset of cancer development making tusc a potential target for all stages of cancer  including metastatic disease the tusc protein is reduced or absent in approximately  of lung cancers in patients with nsclc the loss of tusc expression has been associated with significantly worse overall survival than when tusc expression is not impaired studies show tusc protein functions as a key mediator in the apafmediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by recruiting and directing cytoplasmic apaf protein to a critical cellular location and activating it in situ and by upregulating activity of other proapoptotic effectors normal tusc function mediates apoptosis in cancer cells through interaction with apaf and downregulates multiple tyrosine kinases including egfr akt pdgfr ckit and cabl tusc mediates apoptosis in cancer cells but not normal cells through its interaction with apaf and downregulates tyrosine kinases including egfr pdgfr ckit and cabl in normal cells the proteins involved in the pikakt pathway also called the mtor pathway  in which pik a kinase generates messenger molecules required to translocate akt another protein kinase to the cell’s plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated and activated  play an important role in cellular function and cellular trafficking these proteins are often found to be aberrantly active in cancers causing cells to lose their ability to control cell growth proliferation and differentiation thus mutations in pik overexpression and its upstream receptors egfr have been associated with many forms of cancers similarly proteins in the rasmapk pathway  which is a signal transduction pathway that transduces signals to the cell nucleus where specific genes are activated for cell growth division and differentiation play a critical role in cellular responses to various stress stimuli including osmotic stress dna damage and proinflammatory factors as shown in the figures below the tusc protein a potent pankinase inhibitor blocks multiple cell signaling pathways downstream of the receptor egfr in the figures  leading to cell cycle interruption and thereby preventing cancer cell proliferation and survival additionally under stress conditions such as oncogenic stress cells go through a regulated process of programmed cell death or cellular suicide called apoptosis in order to control cell development and replication the tusc protein interacts via various apoptotic signaling pathways to stimulate programmed cell death via the release of caspases enzymes that play a significant role in apoptosis  table of contents pankinase inhibition by tusc  table of contents stimulation of apoptotic signaling by tusc  table of contents cancer and the immune response when functioning normally the body’s immune system recognizes and destroys cancer cells as well as other mutated cells and foreign bodies as cancer develops over time some mutations in cancer cells enable them to inhibit immune mechanisms thus allowing the cancer cells to escape detection and destruction by the immune system and leading to the cancer’s “immune tolerance” therapies are being developed to allow patients to overcome this immune tolerance some by stimulating the natural immune response and others by removing the inhibitions on the immune response created by the cancer for example pd is a protein found on certain types of t cells which are part of the immune system because pd prevents t cells from attacking other cells including in some cases cancer cells inhibiting pdl receptors a process called pd checkpoint inhibition can facilitate the immune response to cancer in addition to its proapoptotic cytotoxicity and tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity tusc enhances the immune response to cancer data from preclinical studies at md anderson have shown a therapeutic benefit from the combination of tusc and anti pd antibody and a key role for tusc in regulating immune cell subpopulations including cytokines natural killer or nk cells and t lymphocytes in addition tusc has been found to downregulate pdl receptors on the surface of cancer cells nk cells an important part of the innate immune system have developed several mechanisms to distinguish healthy cells from target cells these mechanisms allow nk cells to kill cells that are deemed dangerous to the host including cancer cells however one of the consequences of malignant transformation is the ability of the cancer cell to evade the immune system cancer cells do so via the upregulation and interplay of receptors including checkpoint inhibitors such as pd and pdl as shown in the illustration below tusc has been found to stimulate the release of interleukin or il resulting in up  regulation of mature nk cells that circulate and target cancer cells  table of contents       modulation by tusc of the immune response to cancer  table of contents the genprex platform and oncoprex genprex is developing a novel approach to cancer treatment based on our immunogene therapy platform which is designed to deliver any of a number of cancer fighting tumorsuppressor genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer the genprex platform consists of anticancer genes encapsulated in nanovesicles that can be delivered intravenously our lead product candidate oncoprex is the tusc gene as the active anticancer agent encapsulated into nanovesicles made from fat molecules with a positive electrical charge formulated for intravenous administration in our ongoing phase ii clinical trial oncoprex is injected intravenously approximately every  days for as long as the patient continues to benefit which is defined as tumor size stabilization or shrinkage oncoprex has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells reestablishes pathways for programmed cell death or apoptosis in cancer cells and modulates the immune response against cancer cells oncoprex has also been shown to block mechanisms that create drug resistance oncoprex is a pankinase inhibitor shown to simultaneously inhibit the egfr and akt oncogenic kinase pathways in vitro and in vivo  once the cancer cell takes up the nanovesicle containing tusc it is reprogrammed to die resistance to targeted drugs and checkpoint inhibitors develop through activation of alternate bypass pathways for example when pd is blocked the tim checkpoint is upregulated we believe that oncoprex’ multimodal activity will block emerging bypass pathways reducing the probability that drug resistance develops our cancer gene therapy platform and its delivery system are highly targeted while the tusc gene induces apoptosis in cancer cells which have low or absent tusc expression tusc delivered by nanovesicles to normal cells is not toxic moreover the nanovesicles are taken up by tumor cells after oncoprex treatment at  to  times the rate at which they are taken up by normal cells because of selective endocytosis  or enveloping by the cell of the nanovesicle lipid formulation and the enhanced permeability and retention or epr characteristics of tumor vasculature without the need for external ligands or binding molecules pre and posttreatment biopsies following intravenous injection of oncoprex in a phase  clinical trial showed robust tusc protein expression in cancer cells at both primary and metastatic tumor sites our preclinical and clinical data indicate that oncoprex is well tolerated and may be effective alone or in combination with targeted small molecule therapies thereby facilitating the action of both drugs allowing use in expanded populations of patients who may benefit from advanced therapy regimens data have shown that when oncoprex is combined with egfr tki therapy such as erlotinib in egfr mutated resistant cancers the combination therapy overcomes intrinsic and acquired therapeutic resistance by simultaneously inactivating the egfr and the akt signaling pathways to restore apoptotic signaling  overcoming egfr resistance in a clinical setting could provide a path for approval of oncoprex for patients who do not have an activating egfr mutation  of patients of american and european descent and  to  of those of asian descent and or for patients who have an activating egfr mutation but who have become resistant to erlotinib clinical and preclinical data indicate that oncoprex when combined with egfr tkis such as erlotinib and gefitinib provides a synergistic effect that could also benefit the larger population of nsclc patients who are egfr negative which means they are not expected to benefit from egfr tki drugs alone further our data show that oncoprex may resensitize egfr positive patients who become resistant to and therefore no longer benefit from egfr tkis alone thus oncoprex may both significantly expand the benefit of egfr tkis to the majority of patients  of those of american and european descent and  to  of those of asian descent who do not have egfr activating mutations and would therefore not otherwise be expected to benefit from egfr tki drugs and also extend the usefulness and benefit of egfr tkis for the population of nsclc patients who are egfr positive but who do not have the t mutation and who have become refractory to erlotinib for whom there is currently no wellaccepted standard treatment other than chemotherapy  many currently approved cancer therapeutics target only single molecules or a single specific genetic abnormality related to driving the proliferation and survival of cancer cells in contrast oncoprex works by targeting several molecules within the cancer cell to interrupt cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells to target and kill cancer cells to block mechanisms that create drug resistance and to stimulate the natural immune response moreover clinical and preclinical data show that oncoprex works with other cancer drugs or their nonhumanized equivalents to produce more effective anticancer effects than either produces alone in conjunction with these other drugs and equivalents oncoprex has been shown to mediate an antitumor response through upregulation of nk cells cd t cells and downregulation of regulatory t cells or tregs and pdl receptors activate alternative immune mechanisms with the potential to complement checkpoint inhibitors published data indicate that effectiveness of these kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy drugs is enhanced when they are combined with oncoprex  table of contents   delivery system the genprex immunogene therapy platform consists of anticancer genes encapsulated in nanovesicles delivered intravenously the oncoprex tusc gene is encapsulated in a positively charged nanovesicle that binds to actively replicating and therefore negatively charged cancer cells and then enters the cancer cell through selective endocytosis these nanoscale vesicles differ significantly from liposomes historically used for drug delivery in that they are true particles encapsulating the therapeutic payload within a bilamellar lipid coat our collaborators at md anderson have optimized the characteristics of lipids including n      dioleoyloxypropylnnntrimethylammonium methyl sulfate  or dotapcholesterol and a dna plasmid expressing the tusc tumor suppressor gene which form a spherical particle with a hollow center nanoscale in size which encapsulates the tusc gene for delivery as oncoprex     operation of the oncoprex tusc nanovesicle delivery system    table of contents the particle size is small enough to allow oncoprex to cross tight barriers in the lung but large enough to avoid accumulation or clearance in the liver spleen and kidney the cationic positive charge of the nanovesicle targets cancer cells and direct nanovesicle fusion avoids target cell endocytosis a phase i clinical trial showed that intravenous oncoprex therapy selectively and preferentially targeted primary and metastatic tumor cells resulting in anticancer activity the nanovesicles are nonimmunogenic allowing repetitive therapeutic dosing and providing extended halflife in the circulation we believe that the nanovesicles used in oncoprex are applicable to delivery of a range of therapeutic and prophylactic plasmid dnas and rna interference constructs the nanovesicle manufacturing methods we and our collaborators have developed have been optimized and we believe they may be useful for a wide array of disease treatments clinical outcomes demonstrated that the delivery system used in oncoprex is well tolerated in humans and can deliver high therapeutic doses the nanovesicle delivery system and safety database may be attractive to drug developers because it overcomes historical technological boundaries with lipidbased delivery systems platform technologies we hold an exclusive worldwide license to patents covering the therapeutic use of a series of genes in the p region of the human chromosome including tusc that have been shown in preclinical and clinical research to have cancer fighting properties while we are initially targeting nsclc data from preclinical studies conducted by others indicate that product candidates derived from our immunogene therapy platform may also be effective with respect to other types of cancer including soft tissue kidney head and neck and breast cancer preclinical and clinical data also indicate that our current and potential product candidates are complementary to other successful cancer drugs therefore our platform technologies may allow delivery of any of a number of cancer fighting genes alone or in combination with other cancer therapies to combat multiple types of cancer in addition we plan to investigate biomarkers to predict response and additional immunotherapies to combine with oncoprex preclinical and clinical development rationale and strategy phase i monotherapy clinical trial in  md anderson researchers completed a phase i clinical trial of oncoprex as a monotherapy the primary objective of this phase i trial was to assess the toxicity of oncoprex administered intravenously and to determine the maximum tolerated dose or mtd and recommended phase ii dose  of oncoprex alone secondary objectives were to assess the expression of tusc following intravenous delivery of oncoprex in tumor biopsies and also to assess the anticancer activity of oncoprex  although the study was not designed to show changes in outcomes this trial demonstrated that oncoprex was well tolerated  established the mtd and the therapeutic dosage for oncoprex at  mgkg administered every  days  and showed that cancer growth was halted in some patients tumor regressions occurred in primary lung tumors and metastatic cancers in the liver pancreas and lymph nodes pre and posttreatment patient biopsies demonstrated that intravenous oncoprex selectively and preferentially targeted patients’ cancer cells and suggested that clinical anticancer activity was mediated by tusc in the phase i monotherapy trial oncoprex was injected intravenously in stage iv metastatic lung cancer patients who had received traditional platinum combination chemotherapy but still showed tumor progression at the time of entry into the study oncoprex was manufactured in gmp facilities to meet specifications of size appearance and transfection efficiency during the trial manufacturing was transferred from baylor college of medicine to md anderson thus confirming reproducibility of the manufacturing process subjects received escalating doses ranging from  mgkg to  mgkg at threeweek intervals for a maximum of six cycles of a dose every three weeks fever is a common reaction to intravenous drug administration  accordingly dexamethasone a steroid and diphenhydramine an

metabolic activity in the tumor as shown by positron emission tomography or pet imaging the response was documented with pet scans performed after the second fourth and sixth doses all showing decreased metabolic activity in the tumor with no changes in size or number of metastases by computed tomography or ct imaging the illustration below is of the pet scan of this subject performed after

the final treatment with oncoprex to our knowledge without evidence of cancer progression in the responding sites to test whether the tusc gene introduced by oncoprex therapy was expressed following oncoprex therapy in the phase i monotherapy trial pretreatment and hour posttreatment tumor biopsies were obtained from  subjects by percutaneous ct guidance from a central tumor location a quantitative real time reverse transcriptase pcr or rtpcr analysis using a plasmid tusc sequencespecific probe was performed on samples blinded to time of biopsy the rtpcr analysis detected high levels of tusc plasmid expression in  of  posttreatment tumor specimens but not in pretreatment specimens or negative controls in addition an in situ proximity ligation assay or pla performed on paired biopsies from  subjects demonstrated no tusc protein staining in pretreatment tissues compared with intense tusc protein staining in posttreatment tissues for the pla antitusc polyclonal antibodies were developed to detect the presence of tusc pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies were obtained from  patients the top panel for each patient in the illustration below represents the pretreatment biopsy “controls” with dapi a type of blue stain the bottom panel for each patient are posttreatment biopsies and represent overlays of blue dapi staining and red antitusc antibody staining the blue stains in the top panels indicate the absence of tusc in the pretreatment biopsies and the red and purple red overlaying blue stains in the bottom panels indicate the presence of tusc in robust quantities in the posttreatment biopsies showing that tusc was successfully introduced into the tumors in the phase i monotherapy trial   proximity ligation assay pla for tusc protein in tumor biopsies  table of contents an rtpcr gene expression profiling analysis of apoptotic pathway genes in a paired specimen showing high posttreatment levels of tusc mrna and protein in one subject also showed upregulation and downregulation of certain genes involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways antibodies to single and double stranded dna were not detected  months after completion of  cycles of therapy in the subject indicating that within that period no antidna antibodies had developed the conclusion from the phase i monotherapy trial was that oncoprex administered intravenously in lung cancer patients was well tolerated with demonstrable gene delivery to tumors with protein expression and evidence of antitumor activity although the number of biopsies was limited due to regulatory constraints the consistent results across test platforms suggests that these observations are reliable based on the positive results from the phase i monotherapy trial and preclinical data from studies of the combination of oncoprex plus egfr tki drugs we are evaluating oncoprex as a lung cancer therapeutic to be used in combination with the egfr kinase inhibitor erlotinib in our ongoing phase iii combination therapy trial preclinical studies investigators at md anderson conducted preclinical research showing that oncoprex alone blocked the activation of the cabl tyrosine kinase a number of other studies at md anderson have demonstrated the complementary effects of oncoprex combined with a variety of targeted kinase inhibitory agents both marketed and in various stages of clinical development including erlotinib gefitinib mk and others researchers investigated the use of oncoprex combined with commercially available egfr tki drugs erlotinib and gefitinib and conducted preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies combining oncoprex with these drugs in a variety of human lung cancer cell lines including cancers with activating egfr mutations and egfr mutation negative cancers lung cancers known to have intrinsic and acquired resistance to erlotinib therapy were also studied as were krasrelated and other cancers notably studies in xenograft animal models demonstrated that oncoprex and either erlotinib or gefitinib showed synergistic anticancer effects superior to either agent used alone in both egfr mutation negative cancers generally not candidates for erlotinib and in egfr mutation positive cancers optimal candidates for erlotinib including cancers known to be resistant to erlotinib therapy the addition of oncoprex to either erlotinib or gefitinib overcame druginduced resistance by simultaneously inactivating egfr and akt signaling pathways and by inducing apoptosis in erlotinib or gefitinibresistant cancers with egfr mutations and with egfr mutationnegative cancers in one study md anderson researchers tested the combination of erlotinib and oncoprex against five human nsclc cell lines h h a h and h the latter of which has the lr and tm egfr mutations and is highly resistant to erlotinib the results showed that the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib significantly reduced nsclc colony formation beyond the effect of erlotinib oncoprex or controls alone p at both  and   um concentrations for all cell lines  the cooperative interaction between erlotinib and oncoprex was confirmed in vivo using a lung colony formation metastases model in nunu mice with a human lung cancer cells injected in the tail vein mice were treated with the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib and various controls including empty nanovesicles erlotinib alone oncoprex alone and other controls the greatest reduction in lung colonies occurred with the oncoprex with erlotinib combination  reduction which was reduced compared to all control groups p in terms of total tumor nodules the cooperative effect is greater than  this means that there is less than a  in  chance that the low dose erlotinib with tusc combination does not have a cooperative effect and greater than  in  chance that the cooperative effect exists pvalue is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance the smaller the pvalue the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone in general if the pvalue is less than or equal to  the outcome is considered statistically significant the fda’s evidentiary standard of efficacy generally relies on a pvalue of less than or equal to  md anderson researchers also tested oncoprex in tuscdeficient and erlotinib or gefitinibresistant nsclc cell lines treatment of the nsclc egfr mutation negative cell lines h h h and h cancer cell line showed that the oncoprex combination significantly sensitized p response of the cancer cell lines to both erlotinib or gefitinib treatment and synergistically induced apoptosis in vitro  the findings were confirmed in vivo in an h orthotopic lung cancer mouse model these studies included the kras mutant cell line h which is significant because patients with kras mutant tumors are generally unresponsive to erlotinib or gefitinib synergistic induction of apoptosis was observed with the combination of oncoprex and concentrations of erlotinib or gefitinib similar to steadystate serum concentrations achievable with oral dosing the combination of oncoprex and either erlotinib or gefitinib induced similar levels of tumor cell growth inhibition apoptosis induction and inactivation of oncogenic protein kinases  table of contents data from these and other md anderson studies suggest a combination of oncoprex with gefitinib or erlotinib can promote synergistic tumor cell killing and overcome druginduced resistance by simultaneously inactivating the egfr and the akt signaling pathways and by inducing apoptosis in resistant cells with nonmutated egfr these data suggest that nsclc patients with an activating egfr mutation whose cancer progresses on erlotinib may potentially benefit from oncoprex with erlotinib combination therapy these data also suggest that nsclc patients without an activating egfr mutation generally unresponsive to erlotinib may potentially benefit from oncoprex with erlotinib combination therapy preclinical study showing that the tuscerlotinib combination significantly inhibits tumor cell viability and colony formation in nsclc cells without an activating egfr mutation previous research has shown that nsclc in cells that lack the activating egfr mutations exon  deficiency and exon  substitution is not halted or inhibited by erlotinib at pharmacologically relevant doses in one preclinical study md anderson researchers tested a group of egfr negative nsclc lines for sensitivity to erlotinib after restoration of tusc expression both transiently and stably and found a significant benefit resulting from the combination at micromolar ranges between um and um these concentrations are achievable in patient serum with standard dosing regimens and are pharmacologically relevant cell viability was evaluated in  tusc teton stable clones that had been treated with doxycycline to induce tusc and combined with erlotinib as expected the cells that had not had tusc expression restored were not sensitive to erlotinib alone and the viability of cells in the a h and h cancer cell lines was   and  respectively induction of tusc with doxycycline alone showed more cyto xicity than erlotinib alone resulting in   and  cell death respectively however when cells were exposed to doxycycline and treated with  μm erlotinib for  hours a growth inhibitory effect was observed for all three cell lines p with the relative survival of the a h and h cancer cells being reduced by   and  respectively similarly as shown in the graphs below colony formation was significantly inhibited in cells transiently transfected with tusc and treated with erlotinib the ability of a h h and h cells to form colonies was reduced by    and  respectively in dose titration experiments erlotinib also mediated increased inhibition of colony formation at nanomolar concentrations taken together the results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the tuscerlotinib combination treatment over each agent alone and indicate that the effect is independent of the technique of exogenous gene expression for both viability and colony formation assays the probability of a cooperative effect was greater than  on a scale from  to  zero means no probability of a true cooperative effect and one means  probability of a cooperative effect given the observed data    table of

combination was the only group significantly smaller than the pbs control group p the mean tumor volume was ± mm compared with ± mm ± mm ± mm and ± mm in their counterparts receiving pbs oncoprex erlotinib or ev  erlotinib respectively in terms of tumor size the posterior probability of cooperative effect was  which means that there were less than  in  chances that the effect of tuscerlotinib combination was not cooperative md anderson researchers also developed a lung metastasis xenograft mouse model using the human tuscdefective egfr negative a nsclc cell line animals were treated with the same protocol as their subcutaneous counterparts the number of tumor nodules on lung surfaces was reduced by  after tuscerlotinib treatment compared to  and  for tusc alone or erlotinib treatment

nanovesicles with erlotinib phase i combination trial the phase i monotherapy trial showed that oncoprex is well tolerated  that high levels of tusc expression are detected in the tumor posttreatment and that there is evidence of tumor growth suppression based on the positive results from the phase i monotherapy trial and substantial preclinical evidence that oncoprex is complementary with egfr tkis we obtained permission from fda to begin a new phase iii trial at md anderson combining oncoprex with erlotinib in patients with stage iv metastatic or recurrent nsclc that is not potentially curable by radiotherapy or surgery whether or not they have received prior chemotherapy and whether or not they have an activating egfr mutation  this trial is referred to as the phase iii combination trial enrollment in the phase i portion of the phase iii combination trial referred to as the phase i combination trial commenced in  at md anderson with dr charles lu as the principal investigator  in the phase  combination trial  subjects were treated with the following dose levels dose level drug doses  erlotinib  mgday  oncoprex mgkg  erlotinib  mgday  oncoprex mgkg  erlotinib  mgday  oncoprex mgkg  erlotinib  mgday  oncoprex mgkg as in the phase i monotherapy trial subjects received a pretreatment regimen of oral and intravenous dexamethasone and diphenhydramine to reduce fever along with an infusion of oncoprex every three weeks subjects received oral erlotinib daily during each three week cycle during the treatment period the phase i combination trial was also a dose escalation study with the primary purpose of determining the mtd dose limiting toxicities were defined as grade   or  events during the first cycle of treatment that were considered to be treatment related at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg one subject had grade  adverse events of fatigue muscle weakness and hyponatremia low sodium level considered to be related to the study treatment erlotinib therefore three additional subjects were treated at this dose level six subjects total none of whom suffered a dose limiting toxicity  at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg there were no dose limiting toxicities  at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg one subject had a grade  rash considered to be related to the study treatment erlotinib therefore an additional three subjects were treated at this dose level six subjects total  no additional subjects suffered a dose limiting toxicity at dose level   at dose level  oncoprex  mgkg plus erlotinib  mg there were no dose limiting toxicities thus dose level  was determined to be the mtd once the mtd for the study treatment combination was determined in the phase  combination trial to be dose level  accrual proceeded on the phase ii portion of the study since the eligibility criteria drug administration details other than dose and evaluation details were identical for the phase i combination trial and the phase ii combination trial three subjects in the phase i combination trial who were treated at the mtd were included in the phase ii combination trial four patients in the phase i combination trial had stable disease ranging from  weeks to  weeks the following observations from our preclinical studies and from the phase i combination trial provided the rationale for proceeding with the phase ii combination trial combining oncoprex with erlotinib • tusc inhibits a variety of tyrosine kinases including egfr pdgfr ckit and cabl • expression of tusc in nsclc cells combined with tkis is complementary in vitro and in vivo  • intravenous administration of a nanoparticle encapsulated tusc expression plasmid effectively delivers tusc to distant tumor sites and mediates an antitumor effect in orthotopic human lung cancer xenograft models and • when the tuscnanoparticle is combined with a tki the suppression of tumor growth in mouse xenograft models is synergistic  table of contents phase ii combination trial the phase ii combination trial is designed to include subjects treated with the combination of oncoprex and erlotinib at the mtd with the primary goal of measuring the response rate and secondary endpoints of stable disease time to progression and overall survival the response rate for cancer therapies is defined under the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors or recist as complete response cr  partial response pr disease control rate is defined under the recist criteria as complete response cr  partial response pr  stable disease sdweeks enrollment criteria for the second phase of the phase iii clinical trial are identical to those in the first phase the phase ii portion of the trial began in june  and is ongoing at md anderson the first subject enrolled in the phase ii portion of the study began erlotinib on day  and subsequently every other enrolled subject began erlotinib on day  the rationale for delaying erlotinib was to allow exploratory analyses of potential differential effects of oncoprex nanoparticles alone and in combination with erlotinib on downstream pathway activation and potential biomarkers of erlotinib resistance in the phase ii combination trial subjects will continue to receive threeweek cycles of oncoprex in combination with erlotinib until the occurrence of progressive disease pd unacceptable toxicity withdrawal of consent or study treatment discontinuation for other reasons whichever occurs first of the  patients allowed in the protocol for the phase ii portion of the trial  have been enrolled three of whom were also subjects of the phase i combination trial and nine are evaluable for response under the trial protocol because they have received  or more cycles of treatment none of the  subjects treated to date in the phase ii portion of the phase iii trial suffered a dose limiting toxicity interim results show that four of the patients had tumor regression and one patient had a complete response or cr under the recist criteria the median response duration for all patients which is defined as the median time between when response is first noted to the time when cancer progression is observed was three months the response rate for the nine patients evaluated to date was  and the disease control rate for the nine patients was  the patient with the cr a  year old female upon enrollment in the study had metastatic nsclc status following  cycles of pemetrexed and carboplatin and  cycles of maintenance pemetrexed with cancer progression the patient’s tumor has egfr exon  and  missense mutations which are not sensitive to erlotinib as shown in the illustrations below this patient had disappearance of both the lung primary tumor and the lung liver and lymph node metastases  table of contents   subject with recist complete response  table of contents preliminary analysis of these data further supported our belief that oncoprex may provide medical benefit in several subpopulations of nsclc patients for which there is an unmet medical need and may provide pathways for accelerated fda approval as a result of these initial findings in april  we suspended enrollment of new patients in the phase ii combination trial to collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek fda guidance as to whether the protocol for this clinical trial could be modified to expand enrollment and also to divide the patients into cohorts with a view toward seeking accelerated approval in one or more of these cohort populations we have completed the collection and analysis of the additional preliminary data and expect to present our findings to the fda within the next several months although this clinical trial is currently closed to new patient enrollment it is not terminated and is considered “ongoing” because activities such as patient followup and further data collection and analysis continue if we reach an agreement with the fda regarding expanded patient enrollment and defined patient cohorts then we plan to amend the trial protocol accordingly and proceed with the amended protocol at md anderson and several additional clinical trial sites amendments to the phase ii clinical trial protocol will require approval of the investigational review board or irb of each site where the amended trial is conducted if we do not reach an agreement with the fda on these changes then we plan to reopen enrollment in the current version of the phase ii combination trial at md anderson and at additional clinical trial sites assuming enrollment of two or three patients per month we estimate that enrollment of the remaining patients for the phase ii combination trial could take a year but because enrollment in clinical trials is uncertain that estimate is also subject to substantial uncertainty any estimate of the duration of the trial would also be subject to substantial uncertainty because treatment generally continues under the clinical trial protocol until the patient dies experiences a serious adverse event or withdraws from the trial or until cancer progresses  even after completion of treatment patients continued to be monitored if we reopen the trial  we will need to provide md anderson with plans and funding to move ahead with the trial  whether under the original protocol or a revised protocol we intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to add additional clinical trial sites preclinical studies of tusc in the immune response to cancer previous research has shown that tusc regulates cytokine expression in vitro  cytokines are proteins that stimulate inflammation as part of the immune response  stable expression of tusc in h nsclc cells altered expression of a wide spectrum of cytokines including il il il and  gmcsf and pdgfbeta tusc is a positive regulator of innate immunity via regulation of il expression il induces nk cell differentiation the systemic

results were analyzed independently by biostatisticians preclinical study showing that the tusc and antipd combination cooperatively inhibits growth of cmt lung adenocarcinomas mouse experiments showed combined treatment with tusc and antipd antibody superior to antipd alone in five independent experiments in two different tumor models results of a representative experiment is shown in the

including production of multiple clinical material batches in compliance with current good manufacturing practices or cgmp we have developed a robust manufacturing system for oncoprex unlike gene therapy agents in the past which needed to be prepared individually for each patient or required viral vectors for gene delivery we believe that our nanovesicle delivery system is scalable for commercial production and the final product can be stored for later use manufacturing advances have resulted in improvements in scale quality and formulation for cgmp clinical materials we have worked with multiple contract manufacturing organizations or cmos to use our proprietary processes and protocols to supply our clinical materials we anticipate that our commercial product will continue to be

technical programs to coincide with our pivotal clinical and commercialization goals our cmos have demonstrated the ability to scale sufficiently both in timeliness and quantity required for clinical application and based on our experience with those cmos we believe they will be able to scale production of oncoprex in the future both with respect to capacity and technology production by outside cmos requires advance planning to schedule their production lines in coordination with other manufacturing orders they may have as well as cost negotiation production costs may vary due to competition for production lines currently a cmo completes production of the tusc dna plasmids and transports them in a climatecontrolled setting to our clinical test site at md anderson where they are stored in cold storage until needed pursuant to our research agreements with md anderson md anderson has developed thorough standard operating procedures for thawing stabilizing final formulation required for application and shortterm storage prior to administering oncoprex this standardized process is both transferable and replicable at other clinical pharmacies and we plan to scale this process for

iri collaboration agreement we are obligated to pay all fees patent related expenses royalties and other amounts that become due with respect to the licensed patents patent application and other technologies we are also obligated to pay to md anderson royalties of  of net sales attributed to sales of the licensed products as well as  of advance payments received by us excluding amounts paid to us in reimbursement of development or other costs from third parties pursuant to sublicense marketing distribution or franchise arrangements under the  iri collaboration agreement we are obligated to pay to iri a royalty of  of net sales of licensed products and  of certain other payments received by us this royalty obligation continues for  years after the later of the termination of the md anderson license agreement and the termination of the sublicense agreement we have no other payment obligations to iri under the  iri collaboration agreement or the  iri collaboration agreement we were not required to make any upfront payments to md anderson or iri when we entered into the md anderson license agreement the sublicense agreement or the  iri collaboration agreement  under the  iri collaboration agreement we were required to make payments of  per month to iri we made  of these monthly payments totaling  to iri in  and  and our obligation to make such monthly payments was terminated in  our rights under the md anderson license agreement are made subject to the rights of the us government to the extent that the technology covered by the licensed intellectual property was developed under a funding agreement between md anderson and the us government additionally to the extent there is any conflict between the md anderson license agreement and applicable laws or regulations applicable laws and regulations will prevail  similarly to the extent there is any conflict between the md anderson license agreement and md anderson’s funding agreement with the us government the terms of the funding agreement will prevail some and possibly all of our licensed intellectual property rights from md anderson have been developed in the course of research funded by the us government as a result the us government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future products pursuant to the bayhdole act of  government rights in certain inventions developed under a governmentfunded program include a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us or an assignee or exclusive licensee to such inventions to grant licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if the us government determines that adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention that government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs that government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations or that the right to use or sell such inventions is exclusively licensed to an entity within the us and substantially manufactured outside the us without the us government’s prior approval additionally we may be restricted from granting exclusive licenses for the right to use or sell our inventions created pursuant to such agreements unless the licensee agrees to additional restrictions eg manufacturing substantially all of the invention in the us the us government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits in addition the us government may acquire title in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits additionally certain inventions are subject to transfer restrictions during the term of these agreements and for a period thereafter including sales of products or components transfers to foreign subsidiaries for the purpose of the relevant agreements and transfers to certain foreign third parties if any of our intellectual property becomes subject to any of the rights or remedies available to the us government or third parties pursuant to the bayhdole act of  this could impair the value of our intellectual property and could adversely affect our business the us government has not exercised any of these rights or provided us with any notice of its intent to exercise any of these rights with respect to any of the intellectual property licensed to us by md anderson  we are not aware of any instance in which the us government has ever exercised any such rights with respect to any technologies or other intellectual property developed under funding agreements with the us government  table of contents our current phase iii combination trial is being conducted at md anderson pursuant to a clinical study agreement between genprex and md anderson dated february   under this agreement md anderson agreed to conduct the phase iii combination trial under the study protocol which includes treatment of up to  patients and genprex agreed to pay up to  to md anderson for conducting the clinical trial as of june   we have paid approximately  to md anderson pursuant to this agreement and a total of  patients have been enrolled in the phase iii combination trial this clinical study agreement has a term of five years and may be terminated earlier by us upon thirty days’ notice  with due regard for the health and safety of the study subjects  in addition we and md anderson may terminate the clinical study agreement immediately by written agreement md anderson may terminate the agreement immediately if the principal investigator of the phase iii combination trial is unable to continue to serve and we and md anderson cannot agree on an acceptable successor and either we or md anderson may terminate the agreement if necessary for the safety health or welfare of the clinical trial subjects  in january  we entered into an option agreement with md anderson this option agreement grants exclusive rights to us to negotiate until december   an exclusive license agreement related to patents covering a test to predict patient response to our oncoprex therapy we paid md anderson  for this option agreement in february  we entered into a second option agreement with md anderson this option agreement grants exclusive rights to us to negotiate until december   an exclusive license agreement related to patents covering the use of oncoprex in combination with immunotherapies we paid md anderson  for this option agreement license agreement with p inc on february   iri and p inc entered into a technology license agreement referred to as the p license agreement pursuant to which iri granted to p inc or p a worldwide exclusive license under certain patents related to the nanovesicle delivery system that we are now using for the delivery of tusc but only for p’s use in gene therapy products in which the sole active genes are p and mda as a result of the  iri collaboration agreement we are the licensor under the p license agreement the p license agreement authorizes p to develop make and have made use offer for sale sell import and otherwise distribute the licensed products p agreed to submit quarterly reports of activities to iri including at least such information as would allow iri to calculate the amount owing to iri on account of such activities as well as p’s calculation of such amounts as consideration for the p license agreement p agreed to pay iri onehalf of all amounts invoiced by md anderson to iri up to a maximum of  to be paid by p for patent prosecution expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the p license agreement as well as twothirds  of iri’s ongoing patent prosecution expenses  in each case with respect to the licensed patents additionally p agreed to pay all amounts that become due to iri as a result of the p license agreement or the sales licensing or other activities of p under the p license agreement pursuant to the p license agreement p has granted to iri a fullypaid license with respect to improvements made by p to the technology licensed to p under the p license agreement the p license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last of the patents licensed under the agreement we may terminate the agreement in the event of p’s voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or dissolution assignment for the benefit of creditors or if a receiver or trustee is appointed over p’s business or properties  in addition we may terminate the agreement in the event of p’s breach of the agreement or if p challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents p may terminate the agreement upon  days’ written notice grants we have received grants from the following entities texas emerging technology fund sba  small business innovation research or sbir program the national institutes of health and the united states department of the treasury competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change we have competitors in the united states europe and elsewhere including major multinational pharmaceutical companies established biotechnology companies specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies and universities and other research institutions smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies  table of contents the unmet medical need for more effective cancer therapies is such that anticancer drugs are by a significant margin the leading class of drugs in development these include a wide array of products against cancer targeting many of the same indications as our drug candidates there are a number of drugs approved and under development for treatment of lung cancer treatments competitive with our primary product candidates generally fall into the following categories chemotherapies such as cisplatin carboplatin docetaxel and pemetrexed targeted therapies such as erlotinib gefitinib  afatinib and osimertinib and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and car and car t cells and oncolytic virusbased technology data indicate that oncoprex when combined with targeted therapies and immunotherapies may enhance the benefit of those therapies therefore we believe that oncoprex could be administered in combination with targeted therapies and immunotherapies and thus may not be a direct competitor of those drugs in addition new drug candidates are constantly being conceived and developed any such competing therapy may be more effective andor costeffective than ours many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources such as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing obtaining regulatory approvals recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products these companies also have significantly greater research sales and marketing capabilities and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to inlicense novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete as a result of these factors our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection andor fda approval or discovering developing and commercializing drugs for the cancer indications that we are targeting before we do or may develop drugs that are deemed to be more effective or gain greater market acceptance than ours smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large established companies in addition many universities and private and public research institutes may become active in our target disease areas our competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop which could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payers will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products our commercial opportunities could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective safer less toxic more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products in geographies that are critical to our commercial success competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry we believe the competitive factors that will determine the success of our programs will be the efficacy safety pricing and reimbursement and convenience of our current and potential product candidates government regulation government authorities in the us at the federal state and local level and other countries extensively regulate among other things the research development testing manufacture quality control approval labeling packaging storage recordkeeping promotion advertising distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing the pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the fda before they may be legally marketed in the united states the food and drug administration or fda regulates pharmaceutical products under the federal food drug and cosmetic act and implementing regulations pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal state and local statutes and regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process the approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions fda sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval a clinical hold warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us  table of contents within the fda the center for biologics evaluation and research or cber regulates gene therapy products cber works closely with the national institutes of health or nih and its recombinant dna advisory committee or rac which makes recommendations to the nih on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific safety ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols the fda and the nih have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols including informed consent documents the fda also has published guidance documents related to among other things gene therapy products in general their preclinical assessment observing patients involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events potency testing and chemistry manufacturing and control information in gene therapy investigational new drugs or inds ethical social and legal concerns about gene therapy genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use federal and state agencies congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology more restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our current and potential product candidates under development it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted regulations policies or guidance changed or interpretations by agencies or courts changed or what the impact of such changes if any may be us biological products development process the process required by the fda before a biological product including our oncoprex product candidate may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following • completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices or glps and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations • submission to the fda of an application for an ind which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin • performance of adequate and wellcontrolled human clinical trials according to the fda’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices or gcps and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information to establish the safety purity and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended use • submission to the fda of a bla for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials • satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice or cgmp requirements to assure that the facilities methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity strength quality and purity • potential fda audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the bla and • fda review and approval or licensure of the bla before testing any product candidate including a gene therapy product in humans the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage preclinical tests also referred to as nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate the conduct of certain preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including glps  table of contents where a gene therapy study is conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving nih funding for recombinant dna research a protocol and related documentation has to be submitted to and the clinical trial registered with the nih office of biotechnology activities or oba pursuant to the nih guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules or nih guidelines compliance with the nih guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving nih funds for research involving recombinant dna however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the nih guidelines voluntarily follow them the nih is responsible for convening the rac a federal advisory committee which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings current nih guidelines specify that rac review of human gene transfer protocols should be limited to cases in which an oversight body such as an institutional biosafety committee or an institutional review board or irb determines that a protocol would significantly benefit from rac review and has been determined to meet certain additional criteria the oba will notify the fda and the sponsor of the rac’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol rac proceedings and reports are posted to the oba web site and may be accessed by the public the clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests together with manufacturing information analytical data any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the fda as part of the investigational new drug application or ind some preclinical testing may continue even after the ind is submitted the ind automatically becomes effective  days after receipt by the fda unless the fda places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that day time period in such a case the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin with gene therapy protocols if the fda allows the ind to proceed but the rac decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted the fda will request at the completion of its ind review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the rac review process the fda may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance if the fda imposes a clinical hold trials may not recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda we are conducting a phase iii clinical trial pursuant to an ind however we cannot be sure that issues will not arise that suspend or terminate our ind or that submission of any new ind will result in the fda allowing new clinical trials to begin or that once begun issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the clinical trial dosing procedures patient selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the fda’s regulations comprising the gcp requirements including the requirement that all patients provide informed consent further each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board or irb at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted an irb is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits the irb also approves the form and content of the informed consent which must be signed by each clinical trial patient or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed clinical trials involving biological product candidates also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee or ibc a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution the ibc assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined • phase i  the investigational product candidate is initially introduced into human patients and tested for safety in the case of some products for severe or lifethreatening diseases especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to be ethically administered to healthy volunteers the initial human testing is often conducted in patients gene therapy is usually administered to patients in phase i trials this is also true in situations where toxicity can only be judged in patients with disease an evaluation for preliminary evidence of efficacy can be performed at this time • phase ii  the investigational product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to generate hypotheses for the dosage tolerance optimal dosage and dosing schedule • phase iii  clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate further dosage clinical efficacy potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites these clinical trials are intended to establish the overall riskbenefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling  table of contents postapproval clinical trials sometimes referred to as phase iv clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval these clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication particularly for longterm safety followup the fda recommends that sponsors observe patients for potential gene therapyrelated delayed adverse events with agents such as those we are developing for a period of up to  years including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries either in person or by questionnaire of clinical trial patients during all phases of clinical development regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities clinical data and clinical trial investigators annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the fda written ind safety reports must be promptly submitted to the fda the nih and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events any findings from other trials tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure the sponsor must submit an ind safety report within  calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for expedited reporting the sponsor must also notify the fda of any unexpected fatal or lifethreatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information phase i phase ii and phase iii clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period if at all the fda the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb’s requirements or if the investigational product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients there are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries sponsors of clinical trials of fdaregulated products including biologics are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information which is publicly available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov information related to the product patient population phase of investigation study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved the nih and the fda have a publicly accessible database the genetic modification clinical research information system which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials concurrently with clinical trials companies usually complete additional animal studies and also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the components of a product as well as finalize processes for manufacturing the components in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements to help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products the public health service act or phs act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and among other things the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity strength quality potency and purity of the final product additionally appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the components of a product candidate do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life us review and approval processes after the completion of clinical trials of an investigational biologic product fda approval of a bla must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product may begin the bla must include results of product development laboratory and animal studies human trials information on the manufacture and composition of the product proposed labeling and other relevant information the testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the fda will accept the bla for filing and even if filed that any approval will be granted on a timely basis if at all under the prescription drug user fee act or pdufa as amended each bla must be accompanied by a significant user fee the fda adjusts the pdufa user fees on an annual basis pdufa also imposes annual product fees and annual establishment fees on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs or biologics fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business no user fees are assessed on blas for products designated as orphan drugs unless the application also includes a nonorphan indication within  days following submission the fda reviews the bla to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing the fda may refuse to file any bla that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information  table of contents in this event the bla must be resubmitted with the additional information the resubmitted application also is subject to an initial filing review before the fda accepts it for filing once the submission is accepted for filing the fda begins an indepth substantive review of the bla the fda reviews the bla to determine among other things whether the proposed product is safe and potent or effective for its intended use and has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cgmp to assure and preserve the product’s identity safety strength quality potency and purity the fda may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions the fda is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee but it considers such recommendations when making decisions during the product approval process the fda also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems is necessary to assure the safe use of the product if the fda concludes that a rems is needed the sponsor of the bla must submit a proposed rems the fda will not approve the bla without a rems if required before approving a bla the fda will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured the fda will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in substantial compliance with cgmp requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications additionally before approving a bla the fda will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with gcp requirements to assure cgmp glp and gcp compliance an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time money and effort in the areas of training record keeping production and quality control notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information the fda may ultimately decide that the bla does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently from how we interpret the same data if the agency decides not to approve the bla in its present form the fda will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the bla identified by the fda the deficiencies identified may be minor for example requiring labeling changes or major for example requiring additional clinical trials additionally the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval if a complete response letter is issued the applicant may either resubmit the bla addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application if a product candidate receives regulatory approval the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited which could restrict the commercial value of the product further the fda may require that certain contraindications warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling the fda may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan or otherwise limit the scope of any approval in addition the fda may require post marketing clinical trials sometimes referred to as phase iv clinical trials designed to assess further a biological product’s safety and effectiveness and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized one of the performance goals agreed to by the fda under the pdufa is to review  of original standard blas within  months of the  day filing date and  of original priority blas within six months of the  day filing date whereupon a review decision is to be made the fda does not always meet its pdufa goal dates for standard and priority blas and its review goals are subject to change from time to time the review process and the pdufa goal date may be extended by three months if the fda requests or the bla sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the pdufa goal date orphan drug designation under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states or more than  individuals in the united states for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the united states for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a bla after the fda grants orphan product designation the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process there can be no assurance that we will receive orphandrug designation for any indications or for any of our current and potential product candidates if a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity competitors however may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity  table of contents expedited development and review programs the fda has four programs in place intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics intended to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or lifethreatening conditions these are fast track designation breakthrough therapy designation accelerated approval program and priority review designation the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing a new product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied the sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the fda to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product unique to a fast track product the fda may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application the fda agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application a new product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development a breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the features of fast track designation in addition to more intensive fda guidance on an efficient development program organizational commitment involving senior managers and eligibility for priority review specifically fda intends to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy by where appropriate intensively involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative crossdisciplinary review where appropriate fda also intends to assign a crossdisciplinary project lead for the review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program the fda notes that a compressed drug development program still must generate adequate data to demonstrate that the drug or biologic meets the statutory standard for approval omitting components of the development program that are necessary for such a determination can significantly delay or even preclude marketing approval breakthrough therapy designation indicates that preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapy breakthrough therapy designation intensifies fda involvement to ensure an efficient drug development program and is an organizational commitment from the fda to involve its senior managers a sponsor receiving breakthrough therapy designation has up to six months after receiving the breakthrough therapy designation to request an initial comprehensive multidisciplinary meeting to discuss the drug development program this initial meeting is a type b meeting used to discuss the overarching highlevel plan for drug development these discussions include topics such as planned clinical trials and endpoints any resizing or adaptations to the trials plans for expediting the manufacturing development strategy and studies that potentially could be completed after approval when breakthrough therapy designation has been granted the fda is encouraged to meet regularly with the sponsor and subsequent meetings are considered type b meetings and are established based on the needs of the program the fda may grant accelerated approval under its accelerated approval program to a product candidate for a serious or lifethreatening condition upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit taking into account the severity rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct adequate and wellcontrolled additional postapproval trials to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit in addition the fda currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval preapproval of promotional materials which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product fast track designation breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development process an application for a product candidate may be eligible to obtain priority review designation if it is intended to treat a serious condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness the fda will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review a priority review designation means fda’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months compared to  months under standard review of the day filing date priority review designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the review process  table of contents we believe that oncoprex represents a breakthrough in that the tusc gene is delivered with a nonviral lipidbased nanoparticle rather than a viral vector in addition oncoprex may have broad applicability to many cancers and we believe that oncoprex represents a significant improvement in safety for systemic use over previously approved products for these reasons we believe that our ongoing phase ii clinical trial may provide sufficient data to support accelerated approval as a breakthrough therapy for oncoprex immunogene therapy combined with erlotinib for the treatment of stage iv nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with unmet medical needs whose cancer has progressed on approved therapies we intend to enroll specifically patients with an egfr mutation but without a tm mutation patients in this group have benefited from oncoprex  erlotinib therapy in our ongoing phase ii clinical trial and they have no approved treatments and thus have an unmet medical need which we believe could qualify for fast track or breakthrough therapy designation the current phase ii trial results represent a substantial improvement over the results of the luxlung afatinib trial which we believe may qualify oncoprex in combination with erlotinib for fast track or breakthrough therapy designation we believe that the unmet medical need may qualify for priority review based on a surrogate endpoint such as clinical benefit response rate or progression free survival pfs with eligibility for accelerated approval   postapproval requirements maintaining postapproval compliance with applicable federal state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources rigorous and extensive fda regulation of combination products continues after approval particularly with respect to cgmp we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production and distribution of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cgmp regulations including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation other postapproval requirements include reporting of cgmp deviations that may affect the identity potency purity and overall safety of a distributed product recordkeeping requirements reporting of adverse effects reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements after a bla is approved the product also may be subject to official lot release as part of the manufacturing process the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution if the product is subject to official release by the fda the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the fda together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot the fda also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer we also must comply with the fda’s advertising and promotion requirements such as those related to directtoconsumer advertising the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling known as “offlabel use” industrysponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity fda sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval clinical hold warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors debarment restitution disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register the establishments where the approved products are made with the fda and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmps and other laws accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product manufacturer or holder of an approved bla including withdrawal of the product from the market in addition changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior fda approval before being implemented other types of changes to the approved product such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims are also subject to further fda review and approval  table of contents us patent term restoration depending upon the timing duration and specifics of the fda approval of the use of our current and potential product candidates some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  commonly referred to as the hatchwaxman amendments the hatchwaxman amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the fda regulatory review process however patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of  years from the product’s approval date the patent term restoration period is generally onehalf the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of a bla plus the time between the submission date of a bla and the approval of that application only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent the us patent and trademark office in consultation with the fda reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration biosimilars and exclusivity the biologics price competition and innovation act of  or bpcia created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an fdalicensed reference biological product the fda has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars biosimilarity which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety purity and potency can be shown through analytical studies animal studies and a clinical study or studies interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and for products that are administered multiple times to an individual the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic however complexities associated with the larger and often more complex structures of biological products as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the fda the bpcia includes among other provisions • a year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of the reference product during which approval of a k application referencing that product may not be made effective • a fouryear exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of the reference product during which a k application referencing that product may not be submitted and • an exclusivity period for certain biological products that have been approved through the k pathway as interchangeable biosimilars the bpcia also establishes procedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section k of the phs act a biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the united states pediatric exclusivity if granted adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms this sixmonth exclusivity which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical trial in accordance with an fdaissued “written request” for such a clinical trial the bpcia is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the fda in addition government proposals have sought to reduce the year reference product exclusivity period other aspects of the bpcia some of which may impact the bpcia exclusivity provisions have also been the subject of recent litigation as a result the ultimate effect implementation and meaning of the bpcia is subject to uncertainty  table of contents additional us regulation in the united states our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal state and local authorities in addition to the fda including but not limited to the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms other divisions of the us department of health and human services for instance the office of inspector general the us department of justice or doj and individual us attorney offices within the doj and state and local governments for example sales marketing and scientificeducational grant programs must comply with the antifraud and abuse provisions of the social security act the false claims laws the physician payment transparency laws the privacy and security provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech and similar state laws each as amended in addition to the foregoing state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances including the occupational safety and health act the resource conservancy and recovery act and the toxic substances control act may affect our business these and other laws govern our use handling and disposal of various biological chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by our operations if our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances we could be liable for damages and governmental fines we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict however how changes in these laws may affect our future operations federal and state fraud and abuse laws in the united states our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal state and local authorities in addition to the fda including but not limited to cms other divisions of the us department of health and human services for instance the office of inspector general doj and individual us attorney offices within the doj and state and local governments these federal and state laws which generally will not be applicable to us or our current and potential product candidates unless and until we obtain fda marketing approval for any of our current and potential product candidates include among others antikickback statutes false claims statutes transparency laws privacy and regulation regarding providing drug samples sales and marketing activities and our relationships with customers and payors as follows the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving any remuneration directly or indirectly overtly or covertly to induce or in return for purchasing leasing recommending ordering or arranging for the purchase lease recommendation or order of any health care item or service reimbursable in whole or in part under medicare medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers purchasers and formulary managers on the other although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor additionally the intent standard under the antikickback statute was amended by the affordable care act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation further the affordable care act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act hipaa created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control or custody of any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by trick scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws including the federal civil false claims act prohibit among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false statement to get a false claim paid several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing of the product for unapproved and thus nonreimbursable uses  table of contents the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal antikickback statute and false claims laws which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs or in several states apply regardless of the payer we may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business hipaa as amended by hitech and their respective implementing regulations including the final omnibus rule published in  imposes requirements on certain types of entities including mandatory contractual terms relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information among other things hitech makes hipaa’s security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create receive maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity hitech also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties amended hipaa to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal hipaa laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions in addition many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances many of which differ from each other and from hipaa in significant ways and may not have the same requirements thus complicating compliance efforts additionally the federal physician payments sunshine act under the affordable care act and its implementing regulations require that certain manufacturers of drugs devices biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program with certain exceptions annually report to cms information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals or to entities or individuals at the request of or designated on behalf of the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members failure to submit timely accurately and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of  per year and up to an aggregate of  million per year for “knowing failures” certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions and safe harbors it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us we may be subject to without limitation significant penalties including the imposition of significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages monetary fines disgorgement individual imprisonment possible exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations in addition as part of the sales and marketing process pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved products to physicians this practice is regulated by the fda and other governmental authorities including in particular requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace coverage and reimbursement in many of the markets where we may do business in the future the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms in the united states significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain product approval often private payers follow the coverage and reimbursement decisions of the medicare program and it is difficult to predict how cms may decide to cover and reimburse approved products especially novel products and those determinations are subject to change moreover the process for determining whether a thirdparty payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the drug product thirdparty payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list also known as a formulary which might not include all of the fdaapproved drugs for a particular indication a decision by a thirdparty payer not to cover our current and potential product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved further one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payer to payer as a result the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a timeconsuming process additionally thirdparty reimbursement may not be available or may not be adequate to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development  table of contents the marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and thirdparty payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement in addition an emphasis on cost containment measures in the united states has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services examining the medical necessity and reviewing the costeffectiveness of drugs medical devices and medical services in addition to questioning safety and efficacy if these thirdparty payers do not consider our products to be costeffective compared to other available therapies they may not cover our products after fda approval or if they do the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit coverage policies and thirdparty reimbursement rates may change at any time even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future health care reform in march  the affordable care act was enacted which affected and may further affect health care financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers and therefore the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry the affordable care act has affected and may continue to affect existing government healthcare programs and may result in the development of new programs  among the affordable care act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in addition to those otherwise described above are the following • an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs • an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program to  and  of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at  of the average manufacturer price or amp • a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics including our current and potential product candidates that are inhaled infused instilled implanted or injected • extension of manufacturers’ medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations • expansion of eligibility criteria for medicaid programs by among other things allowing states to offer medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below  of the federal poverty level thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ medicaid rebate liability • a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer  pointofsale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d • expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the public health service pharmaceutical pricing program • a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research • establishment of a center for medicare innovation at cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending potentially including prescription drug spending that began on january   and • a licensure framework for follow on biologic products  table of contents there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the affordable care act as a result there have been delays in the implementation of and action taken to repeal or replace certain aspects of the affordable care act in january  president trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the affordable care act to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision of the affordable care act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states individuals healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices further in january  congress adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year  or the budget resolution that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the affordable care act other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the affordable care act was enacted for example in august  the budget control act of  among other things created measures for spending reductions by congress a joint select committee on deficit reduction tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least  trillion for the fiscal year  through  was unable to reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions of medicare payments to providers of up to  per fiscal year which went into effect in april  and due to the bipartisan budget act of  will remain in effect through  unless additional congressional action is taken further in january  president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years we anticipate that the affordable care act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product if covered and could seriously harm our business any reduction in reimbursement from medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue attain profitability or commercialize our products in addition it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations environmental regulation in addition to the foregoing state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances including the occupational safety and health act the resource conservancy and recovery act and the toxic substances control act may affect our business these and other laws govern our use handling and disposal of various biological chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by our operations if our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances we could be liable for damages and governmental fines we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict however how changes in these laws may affect our future operations us foreign corrupt practices act the us foreign corrupt practices act to which we are subject prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity it is illegal to pay offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to influence otherwise a person working in an official capacity government regulation outside of the united states in addition to regulations in the united states we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing among other things clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks their use may be subjected to different types of restrictions in different countries whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product we must obtain the required approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries certain countries outside of the united states have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application equivalent to an ind prior to the commencement of human clinical trials in the european union for example a clinical trial authorization or cta must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee much like the fda and the irb respectively once the cta is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements clinical trials may start the requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country in all cases the clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with gcp applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the declaration of helsinki  table of contents if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements we may be subject to among other things fines suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals product recalls seizure of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecution in those countries employees as of june   we had four fulltime employees and one parttime employee and accordingly a high percentage of the work performed for our development projects is outsourced to qualified independent contractors legal proceedings we are not subject to any litigation properties our corporate and executive offices are in located in a leased facility in

executive officers serving as one of our directors or on our compensation committee limitation of liability and indemnification our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by delaware law delaware law allows a corporation to eliminate the personal liability of directors of a corporation to the corporation and its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors except for liability for • any breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders • any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law • any unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in section  of the delaware general corporation law or • any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit  table of contents our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not eliminate a director’s duty of care and in appropriate circumstances equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of nonmonetary relief will remain available under delaware law these limitations also do not affect a director’s responsibilities under any other laws such as the federal securities laws or other state or federal laws our amended and restated bylaws which will become effective upon the completion of this offering provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers and may indemnify other officers employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding and also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer director employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in connection with their services to us regardless of whether our amended and restated bylaws permit such indemnification we have obtained a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we have entered into and intend to continue to enter into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated bylaws these agreements among other things will require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers for certain expenses including attorneys’ fees judgments fines and settlement amounts incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of their services as one of our directors or executive officers or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request we believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties they may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers even though an action if successful might benefit us and our stockholders a stockholder’s investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions we believe that these provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and these indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers at present there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification  table of contents executive officer

company” is a privately held clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company developing immunogene therapies for cancer  our first product candidate branded as oncoprex™ is in phase ii clinical trials for lung cancer patients in the united states we are subject to all the risks inherent in a startup company in the biopharmaceutical industry the biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and technological change we have numerous competitors including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies specialized biotechnology firms universities and other research institutions these competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than us in preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new or improved pharmaceutical products and in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals on products for use in health care capital requirements liquidity and going concern considerations our financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however as shown in the accompanying financial statements we have sustained substantial losses from operations since inception and have no current source of revenue in addition we have used rather than provided cash in our operations we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures to further clinical trials for the commercial development of our patents management recognizes that we must obtain additional resources to successfully commercialize our intellectual property  to date we have received funding in the form of equity and debt and plan to either continue obtaining funding through  or until we have secured a capital market transaction however no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional capital  if we are not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital the timing of our clinical trials financial condition and results of operations will continue to be materially affected  these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern note  – summary of significant accounting policies the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and reflect all adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature that are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the related periods the results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year a summary of our significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows f table of contents genprex inc   notes to financial statements note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid shortterm investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  any amounts of cash in financial institutions which exceed fdic insured limits expose us to cash concentration risk we have no cash equivalents and had  and  in excess of fdic insured limits of  at march   and december   respectively there were no cash balances in excess of fdic limits at december   fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or shortterm maturity of these financial instruments asc  defines fair value provides a consistent framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands fair value financial statement disclosure requirements asc ’s valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions asc  classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy level  quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level  quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable level  instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers property and equipment furniture and equipment are stated at cost

and development materials costs research and development expenditures are comprised of costs incurred to conduct research and development activities these include payments to collaborative research partners including wages and associated employee benefits facilities and overhead costs these expenditures relate to phase  and  clinical trials and are expensed as incurred purchased materials to be used in future research are capitalized and included in prepaid expenses awards in  we were awarded  million from the state of texas emerging technology fund “tetf”  the award was received in two tranches of  million during  and   the award proceeds were used for the development and future commercialization of our nanomolecular therapy product for the treatment of cancer  in consideration for the award we provided the tetf with an “investment unit” consisting of i a promissory note “note” and ii a right to purchase our equity shares “warrant”  the funds received for this award were assigned to the investment unit and classified separately from equity as “mezzanine” in the balance sheet in  we also were awarded approximately  from the us treasury department for our qtdp program nanoparticle therapy for lung cancer  the award was received during  for our historical activities and required no prospective expenditures  we accounted for these funds received as revenue at that time intellectual property intellectual property consists of external legal and related costs associated with patents and other proprietary technology acquired  licensed  or maintained by us that we believe contribute to a probable economic benefit toward such patents and activities these legal costs incurred in connection with the patent applications and patent maintenance are capitalized intellectual property is stated at cost to be amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets accounting for stockbased compensation we use the fair valuebased method of accounting for stockbased compensation for options granted to employees independent consultants and contractors  we measure options granted at fair value determined as of the grant date and recognize the expense over the periods in which the related services are rendered and the award vests  financial instruments we have elected the fair value option to account for the investment unit at fair value as a combined hybrid financial instrument containing a warrant and a note see note   prior to its exercise the warrant component was not classified within equity as the exercise price of the warrants was affected by the market price of our stock in a future qualifying financing transaction and was not considered to be indexed to our own stock the note is not classified within liabilities as our management can determine the timing of the repayment obligation if any as a result the warrant and note that comprised the investment unit were aggregated and classified within the mezzanine section of the balance sheet due to the contingent terms of the financial instruments changes in the fair value of the investment unit were calculated and realized in earnings  there were no changes in the fair value of the investment unit at march   f table of contents genprex inc   notes to financial statements note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued longlived assets we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset

technologies developed by researchers at the national institutes of health the university of texas md anderson cancer center and the university of texas southwestern medical center  these patents comprise various therapeutic diagnostic technical and processing claims these license rights will be amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated period of useful lives of the underlying patents or the license agreements note  – investment unit the company issued an investment unit to the tetf in connection with the receipt of a  award  the investment unit consisted of i a promissory note “note” and ii a right to purchase equity shares in the company “warrant” the terms of which were as follows promissory note the  promissory note was originally due and payable on demand along with interest thereon at  upon an “event of default” defined as a relocation of our principal office outside of texas  on september    the tetf announced the suspension of enforcement of certain default provisions associated with the texas commercialization manufacturing and residency requirements and stated that the failure to maintain the company’s principal offices in the state of texas “will not result in an event of  default” emphasis by tetf  absent an event of default we become relieved from our contingent repayment obligation in august  upon expiration of our agreement with the tetf warrant the warrant provided the tetf with the right to purchase shares of the same class of stock to be issued in a “first qualifying financing transaction” at  of the per share transaction

contents genprex inc   notes to financial statements note  – investment unit continued warrant continued the warrant included a provision that required changes in the strike price driven by the pricing of the “first qualifying financing transaction”  as a result the warrants which were embedded in the investment unit were accounted for as a derivative financial instrument and classified outside from equity under asc  as the settlement adjustment from the future transaction did not permit for the strike price to be considered fixed the first qualifying financing transaction occurred during december  resulting in an adjustment to the fair value of the warrant investment unit in the amount of approximately  million  as a result the tetf exercised the warrant for  per share we
