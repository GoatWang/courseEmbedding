offering over  square feet of exhibit space moodys approach to rating this transaction involved the application of both our large loan and single assetsingle borrower cmbs methodology and our io rating methodology the rating approach for securities backed by a single loan compares the credit risk inherent in the underlying collateral with the credit protection offered by the structure the structures credit enhancement is quantified by the maximum deterioration in property value that the securities are able to withstand under various stress scenarios without causing an increase in the expected loss for various rating levels in assigning single borrower ratings we also consider a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of commercial real estate loans is determined primarily by two factors  the probability of default which is largely driven by the dscr and  the severity of loss in the event of default which is largely driven by the ltv of the underlying loan the first mortgage balance of  represents a moodys ltv of  the moodys first mortgage actual dscr is x and moodys first mortgage actual stressed dscr is x the principal methodology used in these ratings was moodys approach to rating large loan and single assetsingle borrower cmbs published in october  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review incorporated the use of the excelbased large loan model which it uses for single borrower and large loan multiborrower transactions the large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from our moodys loan level ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage loan structure and property type these aggregated proceeds are then further adjusted for any pooling benefits associated with loan level diversity other concentrations and correlations moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit estimates original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated p aaa sf classes would be aa sf aa sf and a sf respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys b must be construed solely as a statement of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer invitation inducement or recommendation to purchase sell or hold any securities or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with any other matter moodys does not guarantee or make any representation or warranty as to the correctness of any information rating or communication relating to the issuer moodys shall not be liable in contract tort statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer or any other third party for any loss injury or cost caused to the issuer or any other third party in whole or in part including by any negligence but excluding fraud dishonesty andor willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan pay downs or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls moodys ratings address only the credit risks associated with the transaction other noncredit risks have not been addressed and may have a significant effect on yield to investors the ratings do not represent any assessment of i the likelihood or frequency of prepayment on the mortgage loans ii the allocation of net aggregate prepayment interest shortfalls iii whether or to what extent prepayment premiums might be received or iv in the case of any class of interestonly certificates the likelihood that the holders thereof might not fully recover their investment in the event of a rapid rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomresearchdocumentcontentpageaspxdocidpbs the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures

estate professional it’s helpful to start your search by talking with family or friends people you know and trust who have used a real estate professional in the past often can provide recommendations once you’ve developed a list of possibilities it’s a good idea to interview more than one real estate professional and get to know them by asking questions you want to be confident you will have a good rapport with your realtorhere are a few key questions you may consider during the interview process what types of specific marketing products and methods will you use to sell my home it is

will you keep me informed about the progress of my transaction how frequently communication is key to any relationship real estate professionals adjust to what their clients prefer but you must tell them how and when you expect to hear from them whether by phone email text or all of the above your realtor should keep you informed using a method that’s convenient for you will you represent me exclusively or will you represent both the buyer and the seller in the transaction a real estate professional will explain his or her agency relationship with you right in the beginning you will also receive a brochure with a written explanation listen and read carefully to understand your options what’s going on in my neighborhood if you are ready to sell or have located a neighborhood where you want to buy ask the realtor you’re interviewing to show you “comps” this analysis of trends and market comparisons is something that all real estate professionals should be able to provide don’t rely
