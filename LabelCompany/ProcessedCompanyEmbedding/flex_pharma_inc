sale of shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately  million or  million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares from us in full after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows   million to fund research and development efforts of our drug product candidates for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps and spasms associated with severe neuromuscular conditions   million for the sales and marketing efforts to launch our consumer brand and products and  the remainder to fund working capital and general corporate purposes which may include the acquisition or licensing of drug product candidates technologies compounds other assets or complementary businesses the expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors including the progress of our preclinical and clinical development efforts as a result our management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds from this offering although we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for the acquisition or licensing as the case may be of drug product candidates technologies compounds other assets or complementary businesses we have no current understandings agreements or commitments to do so pending these uses we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in interestbearing investmentgrade securities we believe that the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations through  including through completion of at least one proofofconcept study of our proprietary treatment for individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps under the dietary supplement regulatory framework in the united states the continued development of our preclinical drug product candidates and the initiation of a phase  clinical trial and through the launch of our consumer brand and cornerstone product if the results of our proofofconcept study of our proprietary treatment are not favorable we intend to pursue the development of drug product candidates using the trp activators in our proprietary treatment for other indications where muscle cramps spasms or abnormal muscle contractions afflict patients we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products while we believe that our technologies knowledge experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions any drug product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future the key competitive factors affecting the success of our drug product candidates if approved are likely to be their efficacy durability safety price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors for nocturnal leg cramps systemic treatments such as dietary supplements vasodilators and calcium channel blockers have shown some benefit but we do not believe any medication has shown evidence of clinical efficacy quinine is taken by some individuals outside the united states but the fda banned the overthecounter use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in  and it is presently available only for the prescription treatment of malaria and its labeling contains a boxed warning against use in treating nocturnal leg cramps for patients suffering from ms spasticity the current treatments include muscle relaxants sedatives and botox injections other biotechnology companies are currently developing drug products to treat ms spasticity including xenoport inc which is developing a rbaclofen prodrug and gw pharma which is developing sativex botox injection is the most commonly used treatment for cervical dystonia sci spasticity is treated with physical therapy including surface electrical stimulation surgery or drug therapy including muscle relaxants sedatives or botox injections we believe our consumer product for the prevention of eamcs will compete against traditional beverage companies sports beverage companies and companies developing dietary supplements we believe the principal elements of competition in the consumer product industry will be price brand recognition distribution channel offerings and the effectiveness of the product we do not expect any thirdparty payors to cover and reimburse for our consumer products company description we are a biotechnology company that is developing innovative and proprietary treatments for nocturnal leg cramps and spasms associated with severe neuromuscular conditions novel insights regarding neuromuscular physiology from our cofounders form the basis of our development efforts we believe that activation of certain receptors in primary sensory neurons reduces the repetitive firing or hyperexcitability of alphamotor neurons thereby preventing or reducing the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms we also believe that we are the only company developing products based on this mechanism of muscle cramp and spasm inhibition we have conducted three randomized blinded placebocontrolled crossover studies of our proprietary treatment which have shown a statistically significant reduction in the intensity of muscle cramps induced in healthy normal volunteers we intend to initially focus our drug development efforts on developing a product to treat nocturnal leg cramps there is no drug product currently available in the united states that has been approved to treat nocturnal leg cramps in the second quarter of  we intend to initiate at least one human proofofconcept study of our proprietary treatment for individuals who suffer from nocturnal leg cramps nocturnal leg cramps are muscle cramps that occur during sleep and can cause distress interrupted sleep reduced quality of life and interference with activities of daily living we believe our primary target patient population will include individuals that suffer from nocturnal leg cramps daily or weekly and based on independent thirdparty survey results we estimate that approximately four million us adults over the age of  suffer from nocturnal leg cramps on a daily basis nocturnal leg cramps also affect people younger than  and we believe there is an opportunity to serve this patient population as well a muscle cramp is a sudden and painful contraction of a muscle that may last several minutes and in many instances results in soreness lasting several days frequently experienced by patients with severe neuromuscular conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury or sci spasticity is an abnormal involuntary tightness of muscles and is characterized by uncontrolled movement muscle stiffness difficulty straightening joints reduced mobility limb weakness shaking intermittent spasms and pain dystonias are characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal often repetitive movements postures or both recent research has shown that muscle cramping is caused by the uncontrolled and repetitive firing of alphamotor neurons in the spinal cord resulting in maintained contraction of the muscle we believe that by reducing this firing of the alphamotor neurons that control muscle contraction muscle cramping can be reduced or prevented motor neurons respond to inputs from complex circuits in the spinal cord that both reduce neuronal and muscle activity known as inhibitory input and increase neuronal and muscle activity known as excitatory input our approach exploits a general principle of neural circuits — that strong excitatory input from one source in the body enhances the overall inhibitory tone in the spinal cord and thereby reduces neuronal response to other excitation throughout the body we believe this reduction of neuron excitation has the effect of reducing muscle cramps and spasms our proprietary treatment stimulates primary sensory neurons in the mouth esophagus and stomach by activating transient receptor potential or trp cation channel receptors we believe that the effects of the trp activators in our proprietary treatment directly interact with the trp subfamily a member  or trpa and trp vanilloid receptor or trpv ion channels in a topical and local fashion to yield strong centrally acting excitatory inputs from primary sensory neurons we believe that the signals activated in the trpa and trpv ion channels are channeled directly to the spinal cord creating an inhibitory effect from the central nervous system on alphamotor neurons throughout the body thereby reducing neuron excitation and muscle cramps moreover we believe that the physical properties of the trp activators largely limit their action to sensory neurons in the mouth esophagus and stomach with minimal concentrations reaching the bloodstream and consequently fewer potential systemic sideeffects muscle contractions associated with dystonia and spasticity are also believed to result from abnormal repetitive firing of alphamotor neurons our proprietary treatment contains three active ingredients  ginger extract an activator of both trpv and trpa ion channels  cinnamon extract an activator of trpa ion channels and  capsicum an activator of trpv ion channels we may also initiate human proofofconcept studies of
