the fund will consider include leveraged loans second lien debt mezzanine debt high yield bonds equities and related securities and obligations of leveraged or financially distressed companies andor other special situations a key element of the firms investment strategy with respect to distressed investments is to become active in the restructuring process in order to drive increases in
