bookstore  poster store  discussion forums  search   medieval woodcut of a bishop from gode cookery john morton archbishop of canterbury cardinal and statesman belonged to a family which had migrated from nottinghamshire into dorset and was born either at bere regis or milborne st andrew educated at the neighbouring benedictine abbey of cerne and at balliol college oxford he graduated in law and followed that profession in the ecclesiastical courts in london where he attracted the notice of archbishop bourchier he is said to have been at once admitted to the privy council dict nat biog but probably this is a mistake for the ordinary council of which morton might well have been made a member when he was appointed master in chancery and chancellor of the duchy of cornwall he received a good deal of ecclesiastical preferment from the lancastrian party was present if he did not fight on the losing side at the battle of towton in  and was subsequently attainted by the victorious yorkists he lived with the exiled court of margaret of anjou at bar until  and took an active part in the diplomacy which led to the coalition of warwick and clarence with the lancastrians and louis xi and indirectly to edward ivs expulsion from the throne morton landed with warwick at dartmouth on the th of september  but the battle of tewkesbury finally shattered the lancastrian hopes and morton made his peace with edward iv probably through the mediation of archbishop bourchier in march  morton was made master of the rolls and edward found employment for his diplomatic talents he was sent on a mission to hungary in  and was one of the negotiators of the treaty of pecquigny in  in  after receiving a number of minor ecclesiastical promotions he was elected bishop of ely he was one of the executors of edward ivs will in  and the story of the future richard iii while preparing mortons arrest joking with him about the strawberries the bishop grew in his garden at holborn is well known and apparently authentic see mores description oxford university in vain petitioned for mortons release and after some weeks in the tower he was entrusted to the duke of buckinghams charge at brecknock here morton encouraged buckinghams designs against richard and put him into communication with the queen dowager elizabeth woodville and with henry tudor earl of richmond he escaped from brecknock castle to flanders avoided buckinghams fate and devoted his energies during the next two years to creating a party in england and abroad in the interests of the earl of richmond when richmond secured the crown as henry vii morton became his principal adviser he succeeded bourchier as archbishop of canterbury in  and alcock as lord chancellor in  and he was responsible for much of the diplomatic if not also of the financial work of the reign though the ingenious method of extortion popularly known as mortons fork seems really to have been the invention of richard fox who succeeded to a large part of mortons influence morton no doubt impressed lancastrian traditions upon henry vii but he cannot be credited with any great originality as a statesman and henrys policy was as much yorkist as lancastrian the fact that parliament continued to meet fairly often so long as morton lived and was only summoned once by henry vii after the archbishops death may have some significance but more probably it was simply due to the circumstance that mortons death synchronized with henrys achievement of a security in which he thought he could almost dispense with parliamentary support and supplies as an ecclesiastic morton followed orthodox lancastrian lines in  he obtained a papal bull enabling him to visit and reform the monasteries and he proceeded with some vigour against the abuses in the abbey of st albans in  he was created a cardinal and in  was elected chancellor of the university of oxford he encouraged learning to the extent of admitting sir thomas more into his household and writing a latin history of richard iii which more translated into english he constructed mortons dyke across the fens from wisbech to peterborough repaired the episcopal palace at hatfield and the school of canon law and st marys church at oxford he died at knole on the th of october  and was buried in the crypt of canterbury cathedral a f pollard

monarchs other elizabethan and jacobean histories john morton bishop of elyborn c dorset dorcestshire englanddied september  sevenoaks kent england age c  ely in historyjohn morton is a prime example of the archetypal clerical politician seen in medieval and renaissance england and undoubtedly reminds one of men such as cardinal henry beaufort or later on cardinal thomas wolsey practically nothing is known of mortons life before the late s when he was enrolled at oxford he would go on to receive his bachelors and doctorate degrees in civil law bcl  dcl respectively and would do a great amount of work for the university throughout his life morton also began a career in the church and was given several small rectories to run by  at a time when civil war between the rival houses of lancaster led by king henry vi and york led by the duke of york had already erupted morton had gone into royal service being made chancellor of edward prince of wales being an experienced lawyer by this point morton was responsible for drafting the bills of attainder against the yorkist lords in  this would prove to be a detrimental move on mortons part because in  yorks eldest son would have himself crowned as king edward iv york had been killed in battle the year prior after chasing away henry vi and the lancastrians after the yorkist victory at towton morton was captured as he attempted to escape to scotland and was thrown in the tower and ultimately attainted luckily morton was able to escape from prison and join the exiled lancastrian court consisting of queen margaret and prince edward in france where he would remain until the brief lancastrian readeption in  unfortunately edward iv returned from his short exile and decisively defeated the lancastrians to reclaim his throne prince edward was killed in the action and henry vi murdered shortly after officially ending the house of lancaster and forcing morton to declare allegiance to edward iv and the yorkists his surrender was accepted and he received a full pardondespite his past loyalties to the house of lancaster morton was still able to become a major player in edward ivs government he was created master of the rolls  and was used as an envoy on several occasions to the courts of france and burgundy playing a part in the treaty of picquigny  morton also continued to build on his power in the church acquiring several archdeaconries and being named bishop of ely by the pope in  unfortunately ely suffered a setback when edward iv died and the throne was usurped by his brother richard duke of gloucester in  ely was suddenly arrested imprisoned and attainted by the new king he was put in the custody of the duke of buckingham richard iiis staunchest supporter and when the duke soon after rebelled it is likely that ely played a part in the rebellion buckinghams rebellion was soon put down and the duke executed but ely was able to escape to flanders where he joined the court of henry tudor an obscure lancastrian claimant to englands throne ely then traveled to rome where he informed the pope of tudors intent to usurp the throne from richard iii with complete success tudor invaded england in  and defeated richard iii in battle the king himself being killed and had himself crowned as king henry vii for his loyalty ely was greatly rewarded by the new king being made chancellor of england and being appointed to the royal council in  ely received an even greater honor when he was created archbishop of canterbury throughout the rest of his life canterbury remained loyal to henry vii and continued to be active in both politics and the church he was a huge advocate of rights for the church and believed that it could work together with the government without being completely destroyed ironically it would be henry viis son and grandchildren that would completely destroy that relationship in addition he remained active at the universities by the end of his life canterbury was not popular amongst the common people despite being a valuable member of the kings government and was blamed for a number of taxes inflicted on the people he was personally named by the cornish rebels when they revolted in  despite his unpopularity it cannot be denied that john morton was a good man to have in royal service and had proved so throughout his life he died most likely of plague in  as a man of roughly eightyely in shakespeareappears in richard iiijohn morton bishop of ely appears briefly in richard iii and is seen at a conference with several lords as they debate when edward vs coronation should be gloucester then enters and asks ely for some strawberries from his garden ely fetches the strawberries but returns to find gloucester in a foul mood the duke then arrests hastings and has him executed later in the play it is announced that ely has joined the earl of richmond in exile against the new king richard iiireferencesharperbill christopher ‘morton john d ’ oxford
