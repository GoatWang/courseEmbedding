best workplaces in ohio october  maribeth rahe by marcy lisle when you run one of the tristate’s largest money management firms what’s the first thing you think of each day we control our destinies says maribeth s rahe president and chief executive officer of fort washington investment advisors a member of western  southern financial group i wake up every morning and i remind myself of that for rahe realizing her destiny has been an exciting journey she was president and board member of the us trust company of new york and served as vice chair of the board of the harris bank in chicago she worked for jp morgan in new york and london rahe has been called the first woman to shatter the highest glass ceiling and in  she was one of five female top executives in the fortune  she has received many accolades—including being featured in vanity fair magazine as one of america’s most influential women — and she doesn’t think her sex has ever held her back i know this sounds so pollyanna but i honestly have not faced any obstacles as a woman she says rahe credits her mentor president of harris bank retired donald s hunt for teaching her to be cognizant of the chair you’re sitting in maybe i’ve always selected institutions that have wonderful values and culture she says institutions where i know i’d be very comfortable working it began at bowling green where rahe was a language major after her father recommended she add a few business courses to her studies her focus changed following a brief stint as a phd candidate at ohio state university she was hired as the first female branch manager trainee for a small savings and loan that’s where she discovered her passion financial services she went on to earn her mba in international finance from thunderbird school of global management in arizona it’s a little bit of luck a lot of hard work and being in the right place at the right time she says of her career rahe was brought to cincinnati in  by john f barrett the chairman of western and southern financial group to take over leadership of fort washington investment advisors under rahe’s guidance the firm has added a considerable number of clients regionally and nationally she has also worked hard to create a positive work environment we spend a good portion of our lives at work so work should be a place you like to be everyday she says throughout her career she has made it a priority to exhibit strong compassionate leadership whether in the boardroom or community service i’ve always felt it was very important to be a good role model and to make sure i mentor both men and women it’s just something you should do as a good leader and a good manager she says rahe also gives back to the community she’s a presence on a variety of boards including the committee of  an organization working to improve opportunities for women business leaders the cincinnati arts association the united way xavier university and the sisters of notre dame de namur she is a life trustee or advisor for many wellknown philanthropies my mother taught me it’s important to feel a part of a community she says it adds a great deal of dimension to our lives   related

trust published june   fox news facebook twitter email print this is a partial transcript from your world with neil cavuto june   that was edited for clarity click here for complete access to all of neil cavutos ceo interviews watch your world wcavuto weekdays at  pm and  am et neil cavuto host but it seems no one trusts corporate america these days even the wealthy sound a little surprising well think about it a lot of those rich folks are the very ones who hold top jobs in the corporate world so who better than they to know whats going on the corporate world results of the us trust survey of affluent americans out today and some disturbing trends joining us now from fox central with details on this is the president of us trust maribeth rahe miss rahe thanks for joining us maribeth rahe president us trust thank you for inviting us cavuto so in a nutshell the rich are bummed out right rahe well in a nutshell one of the things that we learned in this survey that was very significant is that they have very grave concerns about what is going on in the economy in fact we asked them consistently about their worries and concerns and two of the five concerns that they registered this year have to do with the world economy and the impact cavuto all right what is amazing is the overwhelming majority of whom say they dont even trust the information that they get and that they should be tired of regulation regarding financial disclosure i think close to nine out of  of them feel that way odd rahe neil you are correct  percent said that they feel that there should be tighter regulation on financial disclosures by public corporations over  percent indicated that they arent sure that they can rely on the corporate financial statements that are being presented over  percent also said the same thing about their concerns about the stock market and corporate management sixtysix percent in fact said that they couldnt trust corporate management and i think it was  percent that indicated that they had concerns about corporate auditors independent corporate auditors cavuto but here is what is interesting miss rahe a lot of these guys are corporate management what is the criteria to be in this survey  or more of income or a net worth in excess of  million so i would imagine a good many of these guys women are in management right rahe interestingly i think the respondents are about maybe  percent corporate executives cavuto so they hate themselves rahe fortyone percent actually earned their income through the corporate employment but its only about  percent the majority of the rest of the respondents actually are retired or in private business or in a profession cavuto now whats interesting about this and ill leave it on this note here it seems that if these are the folks who are saying no mas we have had it we do not trust anyone they are not putting the money in then that is a very important barometer for this market is it not rahe interesting they are in fact still invested in the market  percent of the respondents indicated that they are either holding their position  percent and  percent actually saw this as a buying opportunity cavuto but i would assume with  percent did you know  percent either did not or were just sort of mixed rahe no  percent actually are staying in the market so it was about  percent that indicated that they were going to a safer investments cavuto all right so staying in the market does not necessarily mean adding to the market right or does it rahe staying in the market is i think an optimistic sign cavuto ok thank you very much i appreciate miss rahe joining us in studio content and programming copyright  fox news network inc all rights reserved transcription copyright
