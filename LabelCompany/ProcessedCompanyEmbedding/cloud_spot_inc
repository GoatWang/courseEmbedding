resources as those used by the cloud computing system in this manner platform embodiments may increase the utilization of idle resources and reduce revenue losses associated with demand variability for cloud computing system administrators in one embodiment marketoriented floating prices for gridstyle batch computing utilizing idle resources may be implemented based on monitored and analyzed levels of computing resource supply and demand in one embodiment the platform may allow users to scale up their cpu resource consumption as demand requires and scale back down as demand decreases and pay for only the resources they consume in this embodiment the user will frequently have and perhaps even come to expect a pool of idle resources available to draw upon when demand requires in one implementation the platform andor platform administrators may make such resource availability expectations explicit through servicelevel agreements another servicelevel feature that may exist in an implementation of the platform is that once the user provisions a compute resource they can hold onto it essentially indefinitely for as long as they need it in one implementation of the platform idle resources that arise within an ondemand cloud model can be put to use in a complementary grid computing offering and this grid offering may in one implementation have a lower quality of service while

an implementation of computing resource allocation in one embodiment of platform operation platform computing resources may be operationally divided into a plurality of computing nodes  which may subsequently be allocated to andor distributed among various computing groups nodes may for example comprise individual cpus vms virtual private or dedicated servers vpss or vdss respectively andor the like these nodes may be provided to users as ondemand infrastructure within a cloud computing framework coupled to each other and dedicated to performing gridbased batch computing tasks andor the like in the illustrated implementation idle nodes are allocated to a pool of idle nodes  in one implementation designation of nodes as idle active andor the like may be based on a query of the nodes processing load levels for example each nodes current load average load peak load andor the like as well as current average andor peak cpu usage may be polled and obtained through a system inquiry such as via a unix “top” command in an alternative embodiment a scheduled load inquiry chron job periodic load inquiry andor the like can be set to employ the top command obtain the load averages and push those to the platform controller node allocator andor other platform modules to maintain an active accounting of node loads it should be noted that granularity for such load inquiries may be varied from a per virtualized cpu basis up to a per physical cpu basis up to a per system load inquiry andor the like depending on the particular needs andor requirements of a platform implementation in one embodiment a node may be designated as “idle” when load inquiry reveals that the node is absolutely idle in an alternative embodiment a node may be designated as “idle” when a load inquiry reveals that the nodes load is less than a threshold value such as may be specified by platform administrators in one implementation a functional threshold may be specified wherein for example the threshold load below which a node is designated as idle may vary depending on time eg a lower threshold during weekends than at the middle of the week platform resource demand levels platform resource supply levels andor other factors andor parameters in yet another embodiment each physical cpu may be apportioned into some fixed number of vm virtual machine instances and the nodes in fig  may represent the various vm instances existing within the platform in this embodiment each vm that is currently not being leased by a user may represent a node in the idle pool while each vm instance that is currently being leased by a user may represent an active node in this embodiment as a user requests that a vm node be provisioned for their use that node may be logically moved from the pool of idle nodes to the collection of nodes in the active state from the pool of idle nodes  nodes may be drawn to a class of active cloud computing nodes  in order to satisfy user demand for cloud computing resources  in one implementation the platform may monitor this demand as well as the available supply of cloud computing resources in order to determine when to draw nodes into the active cloud computing class as well as how many nodes to draw at a given time nodes may also be released  back from the class of active cloud computing nodes  to the pool of idle nodes  as usage andor demand for available active cloud computing nodes decreases in one implementation a minimum reserve of active cloud computing nodes may be maintained regardless of demand levels such as in order to accommodate sudden andor unexpected spikes in demand in an alternative implementation such a reserve may be maintained within the pool of idle nodes and drawn into the class of active cloud computing nodes as needed based on demand in one implementation the collection of active nodes corresponds exactly with those vm nodes that have been leased and provisioned for use by a user and nodes are automatically moved from idle to active status when the user provisions the node while the status changes from active to idle upon the user freeing up the vm node in one implementation users may be charged a fee for access to andor usage of platform resources allocated to the class of active cloud computing nodes in one implementation a fixed price may be charged such as on a pernode basis payperuse basis perhour rental basis andor the like in another implementation one or more nodes may be collected into computing packages such as a standard package a highspeed andor highperformance package a budget package andor the like with usage fees depending on which package is selected by a user the platform may also monitor the supply of idle nodes and release available nodes  into a class of nodes available for grid batch jobs  in this class  nodes may be coupled andor dedicated to the processing of gridbased batch job tasks in one implementation gridbased batch jobs may be queued for processing and processed as nodes become available in the grid batch class in one implementation the platform may continuously or periodically monitor demand for active cloud computing resources  and acquire resources  from the class of nodes available for grid batch jobs  back into the pool of idle nodes  so that they may be allocated to meet cloud computing resource demand in one implementation the platform may first determine whether grid batch job nodes are at a “termination point” where the current job may be interrupted without unacceptable loss of data prior to acquiring nodes  back to the pool of idle nodes  andor to the class of active cloud computing nodes  if a grid batch job is not at a termination point the platform may wait until a termination point is reached before acquiring the node for cloud computing usage in an alternative implementation the platform may temporarily allocate other idle nodes to active cloud computing use while waiting for pending grid batch jobs to reach a termination point even if this means that the pool of idle nodes may temporarily dip below a minimum reserve level in still another implementation the platform may signal one or more grid jobs to save progress and terminate processing at the first possible opportunity the platform may assess fees from users in exchange for access to processing by grid batch job nodes  in one implementation these fees may be variable andor based on levels of grid batch job node supply andor demand in one implementation a “highwater mark” level may be set for the pool of idle nodes  whereby nodes exceeding the highwater mark may be automatically transferred to the nodes available for grid batch jobs  when the number of nodes in the pool of idle nodes  drops below this highwater mark or below a somewhat smaller lowwater mark such as when demand for active cloud nodes  increases the platform may release nodes back to the pool of idle nodes  andor to the class of active cloud computing nodes  as needed in one implementation the platform may only release  nodes from the pool of idle nodes  to the class of nodes available for grid batch jobs  during nonpeak demand periods wherein the demand for active cloud computing nodes  is expected to andor known to be lower than average levels andor lower than a preset threshold level fig  illustrates resource usage and allocation variability in one embodiment of platform operation the graph at  displays monitored user demand  for cloud computing resources as a function of time  large timescale variability of demand is evident as well as shorter timescale demand fluctuations in some implementations demand trends may be modeled andor predicted such as by the use of fourier analysis andor other data analysis and modeling techniques the graph at  displays processing cc resources  allocated by the platform to the class of active cloud computing nodes as a function of time  in the illustrated implementation allocated cc resources  appear to track the demand  for those resources shown at  is an implementation of a minimum reserve floor that maintains a minimum amount of cc resources  despite continued lowering of demand  in an alternative implementation no minimum reserve level exists ie the dotted line at  in still another implementation a minimum reserve level may be maintained in the pool of idle resources rather than in active cc resources it should be noted that though the cc resources  appear to closely track the demand levels  no units are indicated for either the demand axis  or the cc resources axis  and the actual levels of cc resources allocated may vary from the level of resources demanded for example in one implementation cc resources may be allocated so as to exceed demanded resources by a cushion amount such as a fixed number of extra nodes a fixed percentage over demanded resources a variable amount depending on idle andor other available resources andor the like in yet another implementation the platform may be configured to allocate cc resources  so as to track demand  with an approximate degree of precision for example the platform may allocate cc resources in order to track only variations in demand with timescales larger than some threshold with less responsive reactions to short timescale demand spikes or dips in one implementation the platform may be configured to determine a power spectrum of demand variability such as based on a fourier analysis and base cc resource allocation on the most prominent andor lowest frequency power spectrum features it should be noted that while the platform my serve to optimize resource utilization within a hybrid cloudgrid utility computing platform with some given total number of available compute resources a platform provider andor administrator may in some embodiments also apply traditional capacity planning andor grow the total number of compute resources in the platform over time in order to maintain the service level expectations of the cloud users as the total platform usage trends grow over time the graph at  displays variation of resource levels designated as idle  as a function of time  in the displayed implementation the total number of platform nodes andor processing resources are approximately constant so the resources designated as idle  approximate the inverse of the cc resources  with peaks and troughs in the former corresponding respectively to troughs and peaks in the latter it should be understood that in various embodiments andor implementations the total number of platform computing resources andor the combined cc resources and idle resources may vary over time based on the existence of available idle resources  the platform may increase or decrease resources allocated to gridbased batch computing  as shown in the graph at  in some implementations bc resources  may approximately track the variability of idle resources  however differences between the two may arise as a result of a variety of factors such as the desire to maintain a reserve of idle resources variations in demand for bc resources andor the like in one implementation a warning threshold resource level  may be set designating a level of bc resources below which a warning may be provided to users platform administrators andor the like to save their progress and quit in order to allow bc resources to be reallocated to idle andor active cc resources fig  shows an implementation of logic flow for computing resource analysis and allocation in one embodiment of platform operation in one implementation platform nodes may be initially configured in andor allocated to the pool of idle resources  a determination may then be made as to whether there is additional cloud computing demand  in an alternative implementation this determination may turn not on the existence of demand for cloud computing resources but instead on whether there is a general desire such as on the part of platform administrators to allocate platform resources to the active cloud computing pool if demand exists then the platform may request that a fee be paid in exchange for the provision of cloud computing services  in one implementation fees charged for cloud computing resources are fixed with respect to supply andor demand of available nodes and may further depend on which of a selection of computing packages a user may desire or select eg standard highperformance andor budget computing packages a determination is made as to whether the fee has been paid  if not then an error message may be supplied to the user notifying them of failure to pay the required fee and the platform may return to  in an alternative implementation confirmed payment may not be required until after a given cloud computing service has been delivered in this case the platform may determine whether a payment method has been specified credit card number supplied andor the like before proceeding with the provision of cloud computing services once the platform determines that payment has been rendered requested nodes may be configured as active cc resources to meet the existing demand  a determination may be made as to whether a cc service has been rendered to completion  in an alternative implementation the determination may be regarding whether active cc resources are generally available for reallocation to the pool of idle resources if not then the platform may wait for a period of time  and then check the status of the nodes again  once the nodes are available for reallocation to the idle pool the platform returns to  and configures those nodes accordingly if no additional demand for cc resources is determined at  a determination may be made as to whether the number of nodes configured in the idle pool exceeds a minimum reserve level of nodes  if not then the platform may wait  and return to  otherwise the platform may configure available idle nodes for one or more gridbased batch computing tasks  in one implementation bc tasks may be maintained in a queue and processed based on an order of priority the platform may query one or more next tasks in the queue  and determine whether fees have been paid in exchange for processing of the bc tasks  if not an error message may be supplied to a platform user administrator andor the like  and a determination may be made as to whether there are more bc tasks waiting in the queue  if so then the platform queries the next tasks in the queue  and proceeds as before otherwise those nodes may be configured for the idle pool  to await new cc andor bc tasks in an alternative implementation the platform may request that an unpaid fee be paid  a determination may be made if the request is honored  and if not then the platform may return to  to check for additional tasks in the queue once the platform has determined that all necessary fees have been paid it may proceed with batch computing of the selected tasks  the platform may continue to monitor demand for cc services andor periodically determine whether there are any increases in demand  if not then a determination may be made as to whether bc tasks have been completed  if not then the platform may wait for a designated period of time  before again checking for a cc demand increase  otherwise a determination may be made as to whether additional bc tasks exist in the queue  if so then the platform may return to  to proceed with querying the next tasks in the queue otherwise the platform may return to  and release bc nodes back to the pool of idle nodes if the determination at  resolves an increase in demand for cc resources then the platform may determine whether pending bc tasks have reached a termination point whereat they may be terminated without unacceptable losses of progress andor data  if not then the platform my wait for a designated period of time  before inquiring again at  in one implementation the platform may issue a warning for platform users andor administrators to save any progress and terminate processing before nodes are released back to the pool of idle nodes andor reconfigured for active cc processing fig  shows an implementation of logic flow for computing resource usage monitoring and batch computing floating price determination in one embodiment of platform operation the platform may begin by querying a level of batch computing resource supply available  for example in one implementation the platform may count the number of idle nodes and subtract nodes required to satisfy any existing minimum node reserve requirements in order to calculate the supply of available nodes a determination is made at  as to whether the supply of available bc resources is positive if not then an error message may be supplied to a platform user andor administrator  indicating that no resources are currently available the platform may wait for a designated period of time  before returning to  to begin to attempt a subsequent price determination if however the supply of available bc resources is positive at  then the platform may query existing demand for bc processing  for example bc processing demand may be assessed in one implementation by counting the number of pending bc tasks in a queue of tasks in another implementation bc processing demand may be determined based on the number of nodes required for tasks in the bc task queue the platform may then determine a price andor fee to charge for bc processing based on the values of supply and demand established at  and  respectively a wide variety of different methods may be employed for determining this price within different embodiments of platform operation see eg figs ac a determination may be made at  as to whether the determined price falls within a preestablished range of acceptable prices if not then the price may be set to the limit of the range closest to the determined value  the price is persisted at  such as by being saved to a database for subsequent reference and use in conjunction with andor in exchange for the provision of bc processing services finally the platform may wait for a designated period of time  before returning to  to resample bc resource supply andor demand and redetermining the price for bc processing services figs ac show implementations of supply and demand based batch computing price determination in some embodiments of platform operation fig a shows price  on the vertical axis and quantity  on the horizontal axis with demand d  and supply s  curves plotted thereon in the illustrated implementation the supply curve  is shown as being nearly vertical implying a high price elasticity of supply and is set to the value qs  of available bc nodes in alternative implementations any of a wide variety of other supply curves may be employed implying that greater or fewer nodes may be made available for bc services as the charged price varies the demand curve  may be determined for example based on an analysis of historical platform data accumulated on users published industry market data ab initio econometric predictions andor the like the intersection of s  and d  yields the equilibrium price p  that may be charged to users of the platforms bc services fig a also illustrates the effect of a shift in demand such as if there is a sudden increase in the number of users seeking bc services at a given price the new demand curve d  yields a new equilibrium price p  that is greater than the previous equilibrium price p  reflecting the increased demand for bc services in fig b the effect of a shift in the supply of available bc resources is illustrated here a demand curve d  and an initial supply curve s  which corresponds to a supplied quantity of qs  yields an equilibrium price p  a shift of the supply curve to s  may occur in response to a variety of factors such as changes in market conditions variations in the availability of idle nodes the acquisition of additional computing hardware andor the like the increased supply of nodes qs  results in a downward shift of the equilibrium price p  in fig c an alternative implementation of bc processing fee determination is illustrated here price p  is shown on the vertical axis and a ratio r between the number of demanded idle nodes and the number of active cc nodes and the total number of nodes  is shown on the horizontal axis in the illustrated implementation the price is set to vary between a minimum price pmin  and a maximum price pmax  as the ratio of active cc nodes to all nodes varies from  to  at  are shown three possibilities for functional forms relating r to p including a linear variation solid line a form favoring steady price near r dashed line and a form favoring steady prices near r and r dashdotted line it should be recognized that a wide variety of other functional forms may be used within different embodiments and implementations of the platform in an alternative implementation the platform may query a lookup table relating bc processing fees to values of supply and demand in other embodiments of the platform
