meet the editors sign in support search search type all products lawyers articles search term location legal topics small business business financing loans  capital raising money through equity investments learn about the pros and cons of bringing investors into yourbusiness share on google plus share on facebook unlike a lender  who temporarily provides you with money to operate your business  equity investors actually buy a piece of your business for better or worse they become your coowners and share in the fortunes and misfortunes of your business heres a look at the pros and cons of raising money through equity investors and the different forms this equity investment can take investors rights as coowners of your company your investors will have some say in the way you run your company they will probably be able to vote to elect your board of directors have a legal right to be informed about all significant business events and be able to sue you if they feel their rights are being compromised on the other hand investors can bring helpful business experience with them that can strengthen your company investors return on investment people who invest in your business often accept the risk of losing their entire investment without guarantee of repayment to offset this risk investors often want to receive substantial benefits if the business is successful for example an investor may insist on a generous percentage of the business profits and to help assure that there are such profits want your salary capped the terms are always negotiable theres no formula for figuring out whats fair to both you and the investor in the end you and your investors will have to work out what you are both comfortable with your ownership structure if you are considering having equity investors in your business you must determine which ownership structure will work best for you and your investors general partnership if you recruit people to invest in your sole proprietorship your business will by default become a general partnership this means your equity investors will be general partners each of whom is personally liable for business debts and liabilities whether or not he or she takes part in running the business to learn more about general partnerships see partnership basics many investors will want to insulate themselves from personal liability for business debts particularly if theyre not going to actively participate in running the business if that is the case consider other ways to organize your business corporation because corporations offer shareholders protection against personal liability for business debts called limited liability a shareholder of a corporation who doesnt participate in corporate activities and decision making is virtually free from liability for corporate debt or activity a shareholder who helps run the company can be liable to outsiders for his or her own actions  for example making slanderous statements or negligently operating a piece of equipment  but isnt personally liable for corporate debts or the actions of corporate employees not everyone chooses a corporation as their business entity because organizing and running a corporation involves some initial and ongoing paperwork as well as some fairly substantial startup costs for more information on forming a corporation read how to form a corporation limited partnership if you form a limited partnership and your investors become limited partners they will have limited personal liability for business debts a limited partners freedom from personal liability is similar to that of a corporate shareholder as long as the limited partner doesnt become actively involved in running the business every limited partnership must have a general partner who is personally liable for the debts of the business that will probably be you so you should evaluate your exposure to risk before you decide to form a limited partnership limited liability company another option is to form a limited liability company llc and sell membership interests in the llc to your investors llcs combine the limited personal liability of a corporation with the tax advantages of a partnership and have become increasingly popular in recent years for more information on llcs read llc basics compliance with securities laws the law treats corporate shares limited partnership interests and usually passive llc membership interests as securities federal and state securities laws regulate the issuance of these securities to investors before you sell an investor an interest in your business learn about securities laws requirements exemptions fortunately there are generous exemptions that normally allow a small business to provide a limited number of investors with an interest in the business without complicated paperwork if you arent exempt  reconsider in the rare cases in which your business wont qualify for these exemptions you have to comply with the complex disclosure requirements of the securities laws  such as distributing an approved prospectus to potential investors  and register the securities in this case it may be too much trouble to do the deal unless a lot of money is involved err on the side of disclosure even if you qualify for exemptions to the securities disclosure rules investors could accuse you of providing misleading assurances always suggest that potential investors check with their own financial and legal advisors to evaluate the investment the bottom line is that although each investor will assess his or her own degree of risk you should disclose all the relevant information to them so they can make an intelligent informed choice for more information on complying with
