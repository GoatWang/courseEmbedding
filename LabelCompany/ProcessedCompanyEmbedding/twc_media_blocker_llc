morranthemorrancave january   twc has updated its voicezone site to include the option of turning nomorobo on or off with a clickwhile traditional phone companies have been reluctant to integrate available callblocking technology to help consumers avoid unwanted “robocalls” some six million time warner cable customers will now be able to turn on a free feature that can cut down on these telephonic annoyances nomorobo was initially cooked up as an entrant into the federal trade commission’s first contest to see who could create the best robocallblocking device it won and since then the service has been available for free to use by anyone with cable phone service voip it’s a filter — no device needed — that uses a “blacklist” of phone numbers that have been reported to the ftc as do not call violators combined with other numbers that consumers have indicated are connected to robocallers when someone calls a number using nomorobo the service takes advantage of the voip technology to allow your home phone to ring at the same time as the call connects to the nomorobo servers if the service ids the incoming number as a robocaller it ends the call after one ring the service was one of several robocallblockers recently tested in the real world by consumer reports readers and it received high marks with  of testers giving it at least  out of  points however to use nomorobo you not only need voip service you have to set it up yourself you also have to be aware of the fact that it even exists to that end time warner cable announced today that it is integrating nomorobo as a free option for its phone customers and that they can switch the feature on and off via their online settings menu twc customers who sign into their voicezone accounts just have to click on “settings” tab then “call privacy” where they will see the tab for nomorobo our colleagues at consumers union have already gathered more than  signatures on a petition calling for traditional phone companies to make services — whether it’s nomorobo or something similar — available for free to customers “we’re pleased that time warner cable is improving their customers’ access to these types of tools” says maureen mahoney policy analyst at consumers union “it’s time for the top phone companies including att verizon and centurylink to take more responsibility for the robocall problem and immediately offer all of their customers effective callblocking technology for free” tell a friendshare on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to share on

photographer getty images time warner cable changes its name and suddenly people love it now it’s called spectrum and everyone is all rainbows and unicorns what happened by kim bhasin kimbhasin more stories by kim bhasin june    am edt the commercial begins before dawn a man rubs his eyes as he gets out of bed peeking out the window at the cascading rain he washes his face pours a cup of coffee and glances lovingly at his sleeping child before heading out the only headlights on the highway are his own as he drives through the darkness as the sun rises he pulls his van into the driveway of someone else’s house the nature of this indefatigable man’s work is finally revealedit’s the cable guyand not just any cable guy he’s the time warner cable guy you know the guy who is scheduled to show up anytime between  am and  pm forcing you to work from home if you even can and never leave until he shows up that guy well he’s the spectrum guy now acquired by charter communications inc in  time warner cable was officially rebranded earlier this year the service has long carried a reputation of abysmal service leaving hordes of dissatisfied customers frustrated with fee hikes spotty connections and the dreaded service callnow tales of woe have become expressions of joy there have been customer cordcutting calls that ended with package deals at bargain prices and chitchat from spectrum help desk operators bordering on the saccharine but most prominently the cable company has unleashed an advertising blitz to erase the time warner cable name from the collective memory one commercial features diligent workers laying down cable on the side of the road another follows harried parents who find comfort in their reliable internet service and there’s even one with a threearmed john stamos using multiple devices in a posh home a representative for spectrum declined to comment on its marketing strategy but even a makeover of new york city’s beloved local cable news station new york  seemed well received though it came with some painful layoffs“time warner cable has earned the miserable reputation it enjoys among consumers” your cheat sheet on life in one weekly email get our weekly game plan newsletter sign up before spectrum took over things had gotten bad for time warner cable last summer one state regulator sent a letter to charter’s chief executive urging him to clean up the broadband provider’s act an investigation suggested that “time warner cable has earned the miserable reputation it enjoys among consumers” tim wu senior enforcement counsel and special adviser to the new york attorney general eric schneiderman told charter ceo tom rutledge “overcoming this history will require more than a name change it will require a fundamental revolution in how time warner cable does business and treats its customers”with charter in charge and the corresponding branding shift consumer perception headed skyward according to data from researcher yougov brandindex each weekday the firm interviews  individuals from a representative panel of  million peoplecustomer satisfaction spiked in the months after the transition was completed in january reaching levels close to rival verizon fios though now it seems that the immediate bump spectrum experienced after the rebranding is fading just changing your name from time warner cable may no longer be enough “there was a lot of baggage with the time warner cable brand” said ted marzilli ceo of brandindex “with the acquisition it gave them the opportunity for a bit of a fresh start”of course charter’s extra effort also stems from an industry wide reality mounting pressure from such streaming services as netflix inc and hulu llc is forcing the old cable companies to change said marzilli all of a sudden there are enticing alternatives and if subscribers have had bad experiences with a cable provider they’re less reluctant to cut the cordit’s unclear how much of the public actually knows that spectrum used to be time warner cable a yougov omnibus survey in march showed that  percent of adults weren’t aware that time warner cable had changed its name a chunk of those who did know some  percent said their opinion of the brand had improved following the switchnevertheless customer retention is a concern for charter as it continues to integrate its businesses time warner cable’s residential video customers fell  percent over the past year spectrum has stopped using the confusing package pricing time warner cable once touted trying to migrate legacy customers onto new plans some customers have received billing credits too“it was a turkish bazaar” rutledge said of the old pricing at a conference in new york in may customers would call in and bargain and sometimes they would score a good deal time warner cable was also fond of “exploding packages” he said which would be discounted until a certain date–then boom back to fullprice when customers saw big rate increases they would get madeven if it’s just a rebranding the spectrum name change carries an inherent credibility boost because one would assume a new owner would want to improve the service’s reputation but in the end it’s still a cable company and each time that modem light flickers or a channel freezes subscriber wrath shall be felt“there is a lot of pent up frustration” said marzilli before its here its on the bloomberg terminal learn more most read rollsroyce unveils its grandest car yet the phantom viii jeff bezos briefly tops bill gates as the worlds
