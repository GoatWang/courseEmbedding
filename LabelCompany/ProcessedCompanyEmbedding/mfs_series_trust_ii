grossnickle assistant director at   division of investment management office of investment company regulation end further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  each trust is organized as a massachusetts business trust and is registered under the act as an openend management investment company each trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future “funds” mfs a delaware corporation is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  and start printed page serves as the investment adviser to each fund  some funds including money market funds that rely on rule a under the act “money market funds” may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements purchasing other shortterm instruments or in the case of funds other than the money market funds investing in the mfs institutional money market fund “immf” pursuant to rule d under the act other funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a fund has been delayed or for other temporary purposes currently the trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks collectively the “loan agreements” the funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians  if a fund were to borrow money under a loan agreement the fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other nonborrowing funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other shortterm instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan in addition while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails the borrowing funds incur commitment fees andor other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan  applicants request an order that would permit each trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements “interfund lending agreements” that would permit each fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other fund through a credit facility “interfund loan” applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the funds borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on shortterm lendings although the proposed credit facility would reduce the funds need to borrow from banks the funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks  applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing fund with significant savings when the cash position of the fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements this situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions when a fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days or longer for certain foreign transactions the credit facility would provide a source of immediate shortterm liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities  applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a funds custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold as a result the fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale resulting in additional cost to the fund or sell a security on a sameday settlement basis earning a lower return on the investment use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the fund to have access to immediate shortterm liquidity  while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails under the proposed credit facility a borrowing fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on shortterm loans in addition funds making shortterm cash loans directly to other funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements thus applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending funds  the interest rate charged to a fund on any interfund loan “interfund loan rate” would be the average of the “repo rate” and the “bank loan rate” both as defined below the repo rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements the bank loan rate on any day would be calculated by the “interfund lending committee” as defined below each day an interfund loan is made according to a formula established by each funds board of trustees “fund board” intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank shortterm loans would be available to the funds the formula would be based upon a publicly available rate eg federal funds rates andor libor plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates the initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each fund board each fund board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the bank loan rate as well as the relationship between the bank loan rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the funds  the credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from mfs the “interfund lending committee” no portfolio manager including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities for any fund will serve as a member of the interfund lending committee under the proposed credit facility senior members of mfs investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel the “investment management committee” or a portfolio manager for each participating fund could provide standing instructions to the interfund lending committee that the participating fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender alternatively the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender the interfund lending committee no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions an “interfund lending day” would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating funds from the funds custodian once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand the interfund lending committee would allocate loans among borrowing funds without any further communication from a funds portfolio managers applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand after the interfund lending committee start printed page has allocated cash for interfund loans mfs cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the funds investment policies and practices in the ordinary course  the interfund lending committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the funds on what the interfund lending committee believes to be an equitable basis subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating funds such as the time of filing requests to participate minimum loan lot sizes the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding to reduce transaction costs each interfund loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction the method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each fund board including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined in section a of the act “independent fund board members” to ensure that both borrowing and lending funds participate on an equitable basis  the interfund lending committee would a monitor the interfund loan rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans b limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each fund to ensure that they comply with the funds investment policies and limitations c ensure equitable treatment of each fund and d directly or through mfs make quarterly reports to each fund board concerning any transactions by the funds under the credit facility and the interfund loan rate charged  mfs through the interfund lending committee would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each fund and mfs and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services  no fund may participate in the credit facility unless a the fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation if such approval is required by law b the fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus andor statement of additional information “sai” and c the funds participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives limitations and organizational documents  in connection with the credit facility applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting relief from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting relief from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting relief from sections a a and a of the act and d under section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person applicants state that the funds may be under common control by virtue of having mfs as their common investment adviser andor by having a common fund board and officers  section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the act and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below  applicants submit that sections a and b of the act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to and some influence over the investment decisions of a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because a mfs through the interfund lending committee would administer the program as a fiduciary b all interfund loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending fund otherwise would invest in shortterm repurchase agreements or other shortterm instruments c the interfund loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments d the lending fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments and e the borrowing fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements moreover applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other fund  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any securities or other property to the company section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing fund to repay an interfund loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections a and d applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an interfund loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing funds securities or other property for purposes of section a of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants contend that the standards under sections c b and dj are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections start printed page a and b and for the reasons discussed below applicants also state that the requested relief from section a of the act meets the standards of section c and b because any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing if the lender is another fund or the same or less restrictive conditions in any other circumstance any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such interfund loan  applicants state that among other things section d was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the funds or shareholders and that mfs will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the interfund lending committee applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating funds and their shareholders  section f of the act prohibits openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank provided that immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness applicants request relief from section f to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility because the lending funds are not banks  applicants believe that granting relief under section c is appropriate because the funds would remain subject to the requirement of section f that all borrowings of a fund including combined interfund and bank borrowings have at least  asset coverage based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application applicants also submit that to allow the funds to borrow from other funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section f  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transactions in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants submit that the purpose of section d is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating funds and their shareholders applicants note that each fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations applicants therefore believe that each funds participation in the credit facility will be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating funds applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the interfund loan rate will be the average of the repo rate and the bank loan rate  on each business day that the interfund lending committee considers whether to use interfund loans the interfund lending committee will compare the bank loan rate with the repo rate and will make cash available for interfund loans only if the interfund loan rate is a more favorable to the lending fund than the repo rate and if applicable the yield of any money market fund approved by the investment management committee as a money market fund in which the lending fund could otherwise invest and b more favorable to the borrowing fund than the bank loan rate  if a fund has outstanding borrowings any interfund loans to the fund a will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan b will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral c will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan and in any event not over seven days and d will provide that if an event of default by the fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the fund that event of default will automatically without need for action or notice by the lending fund constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund lending agreement entitling the lending fund to call the interfund loan and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing fund  a fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the proposed credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total  or less of its total assets provided that if the fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender including but not limited to another fund the funds interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral if a funds total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow through the proposed credit facility only on a secured basis a fund may not borrow through the proposed credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than  of its total assets  before any fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may through additional borrowings cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed  of its total assets the fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan if the total outstanding borrowings of a fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed  of its total assets for any other reason such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions the fund will within one business day thereafter a repay all its outstanding interfund loans b reduce its outstanding indebtedness to  or less of its total assets or c secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a start printed page market value at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets at which time the collateral called for by this condition  shall no longer be required until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a funds total outstanding borrowings exceeds  is repaid or the funds total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed  of its total assets the fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to  of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan  no fund may lend to another fund through the proposed credit facility if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the proposed credit facility to exceed  of the lending funds current net assets at the time of the loan  a funds interfund loans to any one fund shall not exceed  of the lending funds net assets  the duration of interfund loans will be limited to no more than the number of days required to receive payment for securities sold up to a maximum of seven days loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition  the funds borrowings through the proposed credit facility as measured on the day when the most recent loan was made will not exceed the greater of  of the funds total net cash redemptions or  of sales fails for the preceding seven calendar days  each interfund loan may be called on one business days notice by a lending fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing fund  a funds participation in the proposed credit facility must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents  the interfund lending committee on each interfund lending day will calculate total fund borrowing and lending demand through the proposed credit facility and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the funds without the intervention of any portfolio manager of participating funds the interfund lending committee will not solicit cash for loans from any fund or prospectively publish or disseminate the amount of current borrowing demand to the investment management committee or portfolio managers of the funds once it determines the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand the interfund lending committee will allocate loans among borrowing funds without any further communication from a funds portfolio

practices in the ordinary course  the interfund lending committee will monitor the interfund loan rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly

for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions b review at least annually the continuing appropriateness of the method used to calculate the bank loan rate and c review no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of each funds participation in the proposed credit facility  in the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund lending agreement mfs will promptly

anniversary the nations first mutual fund  our massachusetts investors trust mit  was introduced to the public on march   since then mfs investment managementr the company that grew out of that original fund has helped guide shareholders through many economic and investment cycles primarily by focusing on the longterm opportunities created by an expanding global economy as of november   mfs manages over  billion and the firms  people serve  million investors and their financial advisers worldwide meanwhile mits assets have grown to over  billion and  mutual funds are offered in the mfs family of fundsr one of the elements in the success of mit did not exist before our founders invented it in  that is daily redemption this innovation means that if you want to sell your investment in any mfs mutual fund you have the security of knowing that you may do so immediately by exchanging into another mfs fund or if you need your money for other purposes it can quickly be wired or mailed to you this daily redemption feature through which new shares were created when people invested in mit and were redeemed when people sold brought another important change to the industry now the price of a mutual funds shares wasnt determined by supply and demand but by the value of the securities owned by each portfolio another factor in our growth was the development of one of the industrys first inhouse research departments in  unlike companies that rely on wall street research reports which can be used by many investors at the same time mits managers built its longterm track record by visiting companies talking to managers and competitors and kicking the tires so they could judge the quality and potential of each companys products and services for themselves today mfs has more than  fulltime portfolio managers stock analysts and credit analysts who track the equity and bond markets that number includes over  equity analysts who specialize in industries such as aviation media technology automobiles and utilities while mit introduced liquidity that was not our only invention we also established the nations first global bond fund first highyield municipal bond fund and first highyield municipal closedend bond fund we are proud of the record of mit and of the funds in the mfs family of funds but we are also proud of our longstanding relationship with financial advisers not only do we believe investors can benefit from the advice of these experts but as was shown during the market volatility of  people who work with financial advisers are less likely to abandon their carefully designed longterm investment strategies our ability to service your investment and information needs is also extremely important to us the mfs service center handles millions of transactions and phone calls every year supporting the work of financial advisers promptly sending out statements and confirmations and answering hundreds of investors questions every day are crucial elements in maintaining longterm relationships with our fund shareholders that link to our investors has also been enhanced by our site on the world wide web wwwmfscom since  this site has given investors and the general public access to upto date information about mfs products and services as well as market outlooks and retirement information the site has rapidly become one of our primary vehicles for communicating with our investors and educating the public about mutual funds in general and mfs in particular if there is a common thread running through these milestones it is our alwaysincreasing commitment to providing you with the best possible investment management and shareholder service just as we have done for the past  years as we celebrate this anniversary it is also a time for mfs to look ahead and build on our  years of innovation and experience to help meet your investment needs in the next century we appreciate your confidence and welcome any questions or comments you may have

photo of stephen pesek stephen pesek for the  months ended november   class a shares of the fund provided a total return of  class b shares  and class i shares  these returns include the reinvestment of distributions but exclude the effects of any sales charges and compare to a  return for the standard  poors  composite index the sp  a popular unmanaged index of common stock total return performance q could you talk about some things that affected the funds performance this year a some of the core positions in the health care industry helped also several technology companies particularly the ones creating software did well both of these industries in fact held up relatively well during the market turmoil that began in midjuly q could you tell us about your investment strategy a primarily we seek good businesses that exhibit some kind of sustainable competitive advantage this can include a strong market share low production costs research and development strength distribution expertise and good customer service besides this we seek companies benefiting from mismatches in supply and demand in health care for example a sector which is being driven by the natural aging of the population as people get older their drug use goes up and with managed care its easier and cheaper to get pharmaceuticals which means doctors write more prescriptions all this benefits pharmaceutical companies such as schering plough pfizer and elan drug stores such as rite aid and cvs and distributors such as mckesson q however the funds largest sector is technology could you talk about that for a minute a as i mentioned earlier this sector is mainly made up of software companies such as microsoft and compuware these are fastgrowing companies with recurring revenues high margins and the ability to generate free cash flow they are also benefiting from a fundamental shift of labor capital in corporate america that is cost cutting another sector benefiting from technology as well as from firms trend to outsource business is service companies such as ceridian corp a payroll processor and computer sciences a computer services and consulting company q did you make any notable changes in the portfolio during the market downturn that began in july a the most notable thing we did was to increase the technology weighting these companies performed relatively well during the volatility and even better after the federal reserve boards interestrate cuts also economic trends in asia started to bottom and technology companies benefited from that the second thing we did was to increase our financial services holdings including our weighting in the federal home loan mortgage corp or freddie mac here we believe favorable credit spreads and a strong housing market should sustain a favorable operating environment we also increased our weighting in associates first capital a spinoff of the ford motor co its had a great year track record of consistent highquality earnings growth over  of the companys business is in consumer finance and because a lot of the smaller consumer finance companies went out of business it picked up a lot of that business finally morgan stanley became a big position a lot of investment companies went through turmoil but market shares of a few of the bluechip companies such as morgan stanley increased dramatically these companies were conservative and werent making a lot of speculative loans in an environment in which the underwriting business in investment banking almost went to zero there was a huge flight to quality so morgan and a few of the other leading firms got the lions share of initial public offerings going forward we believe these companies should also benefit from lower interest rates q could you talk about any stocks that have performed better than expected a one of the best has been tyco the company has made a couple of very creative acquisitions it bought adt the security systems company and it bought atts undersea cable business a lot of companies are laying fiberoptic cables under the ocean to increase capacity for the internet and other communications and tyco is getting good growth from that business another surprise was worldcom which bought mci communications and seems to be absorbing it very well the stock has doubled this year for two reasons first it is a lowcost provider of telecommunications services including internet service and second it is big in data communications these are the two fastestgrowing sectors of the communications business q and what about stocks that have not performed as well as you would have wished a disappointments included cendant which came about from a merger between hfs and cuc international subsequently it was found that accounting practices in one division of cuc were fraudulent although the stock has recovered somewhat since this discovery the price plunged more than  when the fraud was revealed another disappointment was healthsouth a company that experienced pricing pressure from its managed care companies q looking ahead what kind of market or economic environment do you expect and how might this affect some of your investment decisions for the fund a i think we have to assume a slowing domestic economy and a slowdown in corporate profits in the first half of  although i dont think were going to go into a recession and that well probably see a bottoming next year we want to focus on companies that we think have the ability to sustain earnings growth and to produce defensible earnings streams this includes companies in industries like health care and technology particularly the software companies and some business services companies q finally as you know  marks the th anniversary of massachusetts investors trust mit the first mfs fund and in fact the first mutual fund how do you see this fund fitting into the mitmfs tradition a i would just say that like mit all of the ideas for this fund are completely driven by the bottomup fundamental analysis of our research staff research was the primary tool for mit  years ago and it still is today for all of our funds this means talking to companies understanding their industries and keeping track of the competition s stephen pesek stephen pesek portfolio manager the opinions expressed in this report are those of the
