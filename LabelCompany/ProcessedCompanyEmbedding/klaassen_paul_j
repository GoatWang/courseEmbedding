calendar lists issues sponsored content industries paul klaassen looks back on his year reign as ceo october      print this page by brett lieberman before  seniors had few options for living out their twilight years senior apartments for those healthy enough to care for themselves nursing homes or moving in with family  those limited choices though were about to change that year’s opening of sunrise senior living inc of mclean would ultimately lead to a revolution in senior living within a few years the company built its first assistedliving community off glebe road in arlington  designed from the ground up for older residents it drew hundreds of longtermcare industry and policy leaders who came to tour the community high on a hill with a view of the washington monument they liked what they saw draperies moldings and large areas dedicated to shared space instead of institutionallooking corridors there were no patients in the building just residents it was referred to as a community not a facility and staff provided seniors with assistance in the activities of daily living “that building changed everything” says paul j klaassen “it was the first really purposebuilt assistedliving community of its type” during the company’s annual meeting later this month klaassen will step down after  years as ceo he and his wife terry built the company from a handful of locations in the washington area into one of the country’s largest senior living providers today sunrise has more than  residential communities in four countries with  residents and  employees klaassen plans to remain involved as the company’s nonexecutive chairman daytoday responsibilities will be turned over to new ceo mark ordan sunrise’s chief investment and administrative officer before joining sunrise in  ordan was ceo of the mills corp a shopping center developer terry klaassen will remain active as the firm’s chief cultural officer in charge of training as paul klaassen prepares to pass the baton he leaves a company that has just come through a tough patch following an accounting scandal in  and  that prompted an sec investigation that found accounting errors sunrise went though an earnings restatement in march it completed a restatement of results from  through  that reduced earnings by  million then in september came more bad news   million in losses for the first half of  including a  million writeoff of abandoned project costs sunrise’s stock price has taken a beating as well losing more than  percent of its value in the last year to cut costs sunrise is reducing staff and slowing plans for expansion still klaassen leaves with a bullish attitude on sunrise senior living in general and what to expect in the next stage of his own life virginia business sat down with him on an outside patio at a sunrise community near the company’s headquarters in mclean an edited transcript of the interview follows vb when you started sunrise there was nothing like it why did you think you could pull off something new  klaassen one of the blessings of starting a company when you are  years old is you don’t think of all those things we didn’t think we would start a national movement that would change longterm care in the united states we simply saw a local need which was being filled we felt badly we saw an opportunity for a better longtermcare model a model that was focused more on the resident and the family a model that was more attractive in the physical plant we saw that nursing homes were caring for people that really didn’t need to be in a nursing home … so with the kind of optimism that entrepreneurs have that their idea will be accepted we sold our house and opened the first sunrise in the northern virginia suburbs vb did you envision a series of sunrise communities across the region klaassen we had a second one open within a year and a third one within a year after that …  i always envisioned it as a growth company … after three years we set about designing a prototype which could be built on three acres anywhere in the country it had to be reproducible it had to have timeless appeal vb sunrise has more that  assistedliving communities how did this growth take place and where will sunrise head in the future klaassen we’ve always seen this as a movement you don’t do that by having  or so locations in the early ’swe sold a quarter of the company to bring in private equity that allowed us to expand from twoayear to ayear we went public in  and were able to go to ayear a year ago we hit  new communities a year before the credit crunch right now we have about  under construction and have been on a pace of  to  openings a year that’s the preferred growth mechanism we think the next  years are a time of new construction there are still a lot of zip codes where highquality senior living is not available … vb tell us about changes you’ve seen in the industry klaassen we in fact have seen in the last  years a shift in our consumer … now it is a boomer — a daughter or a son — helping to arrange care needs for their parent or loved one … boomers demand customization boomers are demanding better options for themselves and their parents vb experts warn that americans are not saving enough for retirement do you expect the longtermcare financing model to change klaassen the number of people who can afford privatepay senior living is at an alltime high people are paying for senior living through a combination of income and net worths … we find about  percent of seniors can afford a privatepay alternative like sunrise according to a sunrise official the cost can easily run  a year vb overall how do you see the longtermcare industry changing klaassen i think we’re going to see over the next  years more choices a weeding out of weaker providers less attractive buildings are just not going to be competitive in the future doing senior living well is going to get more complex and more demanding … in the past even poorly conceived projects could succeed even if they were only marginally well managed because there was so much demand as the field becomes more mature you can’t just get two out of three things right vb sunrise has faced a number of challenges from accounting issues  how is the company’s financial health klaassen i have yet to discover any company that goes in a straight line for five or  years much less  years … we’ve opened  communities in the last two years despite the fact that we’ve had an accounting restatement which wasn’t about our cash flow it was a complex joint venture accounting a relatively technical issue that affected our timing or recognizing income but not our cash flow the credit crunch is affecting us today in that construction financing is harder to find we have lots of sites some of which we have to put on the back burner we have the equity to put into these projects vb is the accounting problem the biggest challenge sunrise has faced klaassen certainly not the biggest challenge right now the lack of construction financing is probably the biggest challenge we are currently facing vb at  you’re still young particularly by sunrise standards why step aside now  klaassen moving from ceo to chairman i’m thinking of as a promotion not as a stepping down … i see myself as chairman still being very involved in the design aspect of our product in the training of our new leaders and very much also in the area of public policy i’ve been able to grow the company from zero to over  billion that’s not something many people get to do  vb do you worry that the accounting problems will become your legacy klaassen i thought about stepping down on the th anniversary mark because it was a nice neat number but then the accounting thing came up so i said “i’m going to see this thing through” i don’t worry about legacies … i clearly wish that the last two years had been smoother but i’m really proud of the work we have done the big thing we have done here is far bigger than this accounting bump on the road  reader comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus comments powered by disqus other news down up inc  companies
