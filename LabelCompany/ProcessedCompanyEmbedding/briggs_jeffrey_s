historyedit launched in  in milwaukee wisconsin the company is based today in wauwatosa wisconsin briggs  stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers as well as pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their durability but the companys success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in  the aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost the company started in  as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs developed during his engineering courses at south dakota state after his graduation he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry bill juneau a coach at south dakota state knew of briggs ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of harold m stratton a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to juneaus farm so he introduced the two in  their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry selling the briggs  stratton flyer the red bud at record low prices of us eventually briggs and stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines briggs purchased an engine patent from ao smith company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment the company went public on the new york stock exchange in  during world war ii briggs  stratton produced generators for the war effort some prewar engines were made with aluminum which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material this development along with the postwar growth of s suburbs and lawns helped secure briggs  strattons successful growth throughout the s and s stephen briggs went on to purchase evinrude and johnson outboards and start the outboard marine corporation frederick p stratton sr the son of harold stratton served as chairman of briggs  stratton until his death in  frederick p stratton jr served as chairman until his retirement in  in  briggs  stratton sold the automotive component business the resulting company is strattec security corporation in  the company acquired its consumer generator business from the beacon group and formed briggs  stratton power products the beacon group had previously purchased the consumer products division of generac corporation now generac power systems in  in  the company added simplicity manufacturing inc and snapper inc to the briggs  stratton power products line murray inc one of its largest customers collapsed owing the company  million and to minimize the loss briggs  stratton purchased the name marketing rights and product designs of that company in  briggs  stratton announced it would be acquiring the victa lawn care business from gud holdings limited australia for a million acquisitions agreements and joint venturesedit farymann diesel gmbh – – based in lampertheim near mannheim in germany this was the first foreign acquisition briggs  stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the companys acknowledged expertise in high volume low cost production they officially completed the acquisition on may   despite investing in new production methods briggs  stratton never understood the very low volume highly customized nature of the aircooled diesel engine market after considering adding italys lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs briggs  stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities since the energy crisis had not affected the us markets preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late  five years before the advent of the briggs magnetron defunct competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and service parts black section until  modelsedit cast iron modelsedit

pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their durability but the companys success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in  the aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost the company started in  as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs developed during his engineering courses at south dakota state after his graduation he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry bill juneau a coach at south dakota state knew of briggs ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of harold m stratton a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to juneaus farm so he introduced the two in  their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry selling the briggs  stratton flyer the red bud at record low prices of us eventually briggs and stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines briggs purchased an engine patent from ao smith company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment the company went public on the new york stock exchange in  during world war ii briggs  stratton produced generators for the war effort some prewar engines were made with aluminum which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material this development along with the postwar growth of s suburbs and lawns helped secure briggs  strattons successful growth throughout the s and s stephen briggs went on

the acquisition on may   despite investing in new production methods briggs  stratton never understood the very low volume highly customized nature of the aircooled diesel engine market after considering adding italys lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs briggs  stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities since the energy crisis had not affected the us markets preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp

models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of

competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed

as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs

for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan

models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall

iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the

further reading  external links historyedit launched in  in milwaukee wisconsin the company is based today in wauwatosa wisconsin briggs  stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers as well as pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their durability but the companys success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in  the aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost the company started in  as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs developed during his engineering courses at south dakota state after his graduation he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry bill juneau a coach at south dakota state knew of briggs ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of harold m stratton a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to juneaus farm so he introduced the two in  their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry selling the briggs  stratton flyer the red bud at record low prices of us eventually briggs and stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines briggs purchased an engine patent from ao smith company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment the company went public on the new york stock exchange in  during world war ii briggs  stratton produced generators for the war effort some prewar engines were made with aluminum which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material this development along with the postwar growth of s suburbs and lawns helped secure briggs  strattons successful growth throughout the s and s stephen briggs went on to purchase evinrude and johnson outboards and start the outboard marine corporation frederick p stratton sr the son of harold stratton served as chairman of briggs  stratton until his death in  frederick p stratton jr served as chairman until his retirement in  in  briggs  stratton sold the automotive component business the resulting company is strattec security corporation in  the company acquired its consumer generator business from the beacon group and formed briggs  stratton power products the beacon group had previously purchased the consumer products division of generac corporation now generac power systems in  in  the company added simplicity manufacturing inc and snapper inc to the briggs  stratton power products line murray inc one of its largest customers collapsed owing the company  million and to minimize the loss briggs  stratton purchased the name marketing rights and product designs of that company in  briggs  stratton announced it would be acquiring the victa lawn care business from gud holdings limited australia for a million acquisitions agreements and joint venturesedit farymann diesel gmbh – – based in lampertheim near mannheim in germany this was the first foreign acquisition briggs  stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the companys acknowledged expertise in high volume low cost production they officially completed the acquisition on may   despite investing in new production methods briggs  stratton never understood the very low volume highly customized nature of the aircooled diesel engine market after considering adding italys lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs briggs  stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities since the energy crisis had not affected the us markets preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late  five years before the advent of the briggs magnetron defunct competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and service parts black section until  modelsedit cast iron modelsedit
