business aspects of athenian prostitution explores the contradictions and inconsistencies of athens attitude toward and treatment of commercial sex athenian prostitution the business of sex edward e cohen description this is a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical athens from a commercial rather than from a cultural or moral perspective following the authors earlier book on athenian banking this work analyzes erotic business at athens in the context of the athenian economy for the athenians the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of slave laborwas contemptible pursued under conditions appropriate to nonservile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of free laborwas not violative of athenian work ethics as a mercantile activity however prostitution was not untouched by athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits as the business of sex prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view in which the sale of sex lawful and indeed pervasive at athens is presented alluringlyin a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender to economic legal and social historians and to classicists the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping the author juxtaposes the widespread practice of prostitution pursuant to written contract with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes male and female coexisting with athenian societys pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage show more athenian prostitution the business of sex edward e cohen table of contents

convincing picture of a trade where women were often the tightfisted classconscious and successful purveyors of companionship and sexual servicejoe distefano philadelphia inquirer every new book by edward e cohen is an event and athenian prostitution is no exception to the rule the originality of this work is to offer an unprecedented economic approach to the question of prostitution in fourthcentury bce athens among others it reveals that citizens and not slaves only could be prostitutes despite the social opprobrium attached to this activity the book thus exposes an aspect of

ford madox ford has been among the neglected writers of the first quarter of this century his tragic novel the good soldier in which he portrays in the stoical but fallible figure of edward ashburnham an example of the english landed gentry at its best was written just before the first world war it is a curious detail that  august the date of the outbreak of war is made a date of recurring significance in the characters� lives this unembittered story of deceit and hatred was readily termed �great� �a piece of art and therefore an enlightenment� and �beautiful and moving� by contemporary reviewers a more modern estimate of its worth is expressed by walter allen in tradition and dream �ford�s finest novel is probably the good soldier  as formally perfect a novel as any in english and

authors earlier book on athenian banking this work analyzes erotic business at athens in the context of the athenian economy for the athenians the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of slave laborwas contemptible pursued under conditions appropriate to nonservile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of free laborwas not violative of athenian work ethics as a mercantile activity however prostitution was not untouched by athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits as the business of sex prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view in which the sale of sex lawful and indeed pervasive at athens is presented alluringlyin a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender to economic legal and social historians and to classicists the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping the author juxtaposes the widespread practice of prostitution pursuant to written contract with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes male and female coexisting with athenian societys pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage read more read less curated collections of history books

save to wishlist overview product details related subjects meet the author overview this is a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical athens from a commercial rather than from a cultural or moral perspective following the authors earlier book on athenian banking this work analyzes erotic business at athens in the context of the athenian economy for the athenians the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of slave laborwas contemptible pursued under conditions appropriate to nonservile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of free laborwas not violative of athenian work ethics as a mercantile activity however prostitution was not untouched by athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits as the business of sex prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view in which the sale of sex lawful and indeed pervasive at athens is presented alluringly in a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender to economic legal and social historians and to classicists the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping the author juxtaposes the widespread practice of prostitution pursuant to written contract with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes male and female coexisting with athenian societys pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage advertising show
