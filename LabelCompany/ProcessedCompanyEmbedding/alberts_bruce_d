illinois is an american biochemist and the chancellor’s leadership chair in biochemistry and biophysics for science and education at the university of california san francisco he has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide he is known as an original author of the canonical influential and bestselling scientific textbook molecular biology of the cell and as editorinchief of science magazine alberts was the president of the national academy of sciences from  to  he is known for his work in forming science public policy and has served as united states science envoy to pakistan and indonesia he has stated that science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting for all citizens that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements contents  education  career  science and education  international work  publications  awards and honours  references  external links educationedit after graduating from new trier high school in winnetka illinois alberts attended harvard college as a premedicine major bored by assigned laboratory cooking classes he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor jacques fresco in paul m dotys laboratory the summers research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of dna and rna and alberts decided to continue on in biophysics he graduated with his ab in biochemical sciences summa cum laude in  alberts then worked with paul m doty on an enormously ambitious thesis on dna replication attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of dna polymerase after failing his first oral examination in spring  he completed his phd research in fall  his doctorate in biophysics was published by harvard university in  alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes that was a very important learning experience for me i had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science and nobody had ever told me anything about this careeredit after graduating alberts went to the institut de biologie moleculaire at the university of geneva as a postdoctoral fellow and worked with richard h epstein on genes involved in dna replication of phage t epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of t dna alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing and developed a dna column for the purification of proteins that bound to dna this enabled him to purify t bacteriophage gene  in  alberts joined the department of biochemical sciences at princeton university as an assistant professor in  he became an associate professor and in  a full professor holding the damon pfeiffer professorship in life sciences from  at princeton he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry reconstituting systems in  alberts accepted a position as professor and vicechair of the department of biochemistry and biophysics at the university of california san francisco also in  he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to doublestranded dna in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make dna more years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved another important step in understanding dna synthesis was realizing that leading strand dna polymerase and lagging strand dna polymerase were coupled alberts was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  from  to  alberts held the american cancer society research professorship a title granted for life as of  from  to  he was chair of

first visualized in the s with the use of very simple tools a basic light microscope and some dyes which of the following characteristics of mitotic chromosomes reflects how they were named a motion b color c shape d location  in a dna double helix  a the two dna strands are identical b purines pair with purines c thymine pairs with cytosine d the two dna strands run antiparallel  indicate whether the following statements are true or false if a statement is false explain why it is false a dna molecules like proteins consist of a single long polymeric chain that is assembled from small monomeric subunits b the polarity of a dna strand results from the polarity of the nucleotide subunits c there are five different nucleotides that become incorporated into a dna strand d hydrogen bonds between each nucleotide hold individual dna strands together  several experiments were required to demonstrate how traits are inherited which scientist or team of scientists first demonstrated that cells contain some component that can be transferred to a new population of cells and permanently cause changes in the new cells a griffith b watson and crick c avery macleod and mccarty d hershey and chase  several experiments were required to demonstrate how traits are inherited which scientist or team of scientists obtained definitive results demonstrating that dna is the genetic molecule a griffith b

physical characteristics evident from a side view of doublestranded dna with those of individual base pairs a use brackets to designate the major and minor grooves on figure qa and shade in the surface that will be exposed in the major grove in figure qb b if base pairs were aligned and stacked directly on top of each other the major and minor grooves would be linear depressions all along

which are purines and which are pyrimidines b which bases pair with each other in doublestranded dna  using the structures in figure q as a guide sketch the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs in dna hint the bases in the figure are all drawn with the –nh– that attaches to the sugar at the bottom of the structure  because hydrogen bonds hold the two strands of a dna molecule together the strands can be separated without breaking any covalent bonds every unique dna molecule “melts” at a different temperature in this context tm melting temperature is the point at which two strands separate or become denatured order the dna sequences listed below according to relative melting temperatures from lowest tm to highest tm assume that they all begin as stable doublestranded dna molecules explain your answer a ggcgcacc b tattgtct c gactcctg d ctaactgg  indicate whether the following statements are true or false if a statement is false explain why it is false a each strand of dna contains all the information needed to create a new doublestranded dna molecule with the same sequence information b all functional dna sequences inside a cell code for protein products c gene expression is the process of duplicating genes during dna replication d gene sequences correspond exactly to the respective protein sequences produced from them  the complete set of information found in a given organism’s dna is called its  a genetic code b coding sequence c gene d genome  the manner in which a gene sequence is related to its respective protein sequence is referred to as the  code a protein b genetic c translational d expression  given the sequence of one strand of a dna helix as ′gcattcgtgggtag′ give the sequence of the complementary strand and label the ′ and ′ ends  when doublestranded dna is heated the two strands separate into single strands in a process called melting or denaturation the temperature at which half of the duplex dna molecules are intact and half have melted is defined as the tm a do you think tm is a constant or can it depend on other small molecules in the solution do you think high salt concentrations increase decrease or have no effect on tm b under standard conditions the expected melting temperature in degrees celsius can be calculated from the equation tm     g  c – length of duplex does the tm increase or decrease if there are more g  c and thus fewer a  t base pairs does the tm increase or decrease as the length of dna increases why c calculate the predicted tm for a stretch of double helix that is  nucleotides long and contains  g  c content  consider the structure of the dna double helix a you and a friend want to split a doublestranded dna molecule so you each have half is it better to cut the length of dna in half so each person has a shorter length or to separate the strands and each take one strand explain b in the original  publication describing the discovery of the structure of dna watson and crick wrote “it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairings we have postulated immediately suggest a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material” what did they mean  a in principle what would be the minimum number of consecutive nucleotides necessary to correspond to a single amino acid to produce a workable genetic code assume that each amino acid is encoded by the same number of nucleotides explain your reasoning b on average how often would the nucleotide sequence cgattg be expected to occur in a dna strand  bases long explain your reasoning the structure of eucaryotic chromosomes  for

identify each chromosome by microscopy bands extended kinetochore chromatin homologous nonhomologous chromosomes hybridization condensation karyotype  a define a gene b consider two different species of yeast that have similar genome sizes is it likely that they contain the same number of genes a similar number of chromosomes c figure  in the textbook shows the g  c content and genes found along a single chromosome is there any relationship between the g  c content and the locations of genes  the human genome has enough dna to stretch more than  m however this dna is not contained in a single molecule it is divided into linear segments and packaged into structures called chromosomes what is the total number of chromosomes found in each of the somatic cells in your body a  b  c  d   the number of cells in an averagesized adult human is on the order of  use this information and the estimate that the length of dna contained in each cell is  m to do the following calculations look up the necessary distances and show your working a over how many miles would the total dna from the average human stretch b how many times would the total dna from the average human wrap around the planet earth at the equator c how many times would the total dna from the average human stretch from earth to the sun and back d how many times would the total dna from the average human stretch from the earth to pluto and back  the process of sorting human chromosomes pairs by size and morphology is called karyotyping a modern method employed for karyotyping is called chromosome painting how are individual chromosomes “painted” a with a laser b using fluorescent antibodies c using fluorescent dna molecules d using green fluorescent protein  the human genome comprises  pairs of chromosomes found in nearly every cell in the body answer the quantitative questions below by choosing one of the numbers in the following list       a how many centromeres are in each cell what is the main function of the centromere b how many telomeres are in each cell what is their main function c how many replication origins are in each cell what is their main function  explain the differences between chromosome painting and the older more traditional method of staining chromosomes being prepared for karyotyping highlight the way in which each method identifies chromosomes by the unique sequences they contain  indicate whether the following statements are true or false if a statement is false explain why it is false a comparing the relative number of chromosome pairs is a good way to determine whether two species are closely related b chromosomes exist at different levels of condensation depending on the stage of the cell cycle c eucaryotic chromosomes contain many different sites where dna replication can be initiated d the telomere is a specialized dna sequence where microtubules from the mitotic spindle attach to the chromosome so that duplicate copies move to opposite ends of the dividing cell  for each of the following sentences fill in the blanks with the best word or phrase selected from the list below not all words or phrases will be used each word or phrase should be used only once each chromosome is a single molecule of  whose extraordinarily long length can be compacted by as much as fold during  and tenfold more during  this is accomplished by binding to

figure q  mitotic chromosomes are  times more compact than a dna molecule in its extended form a  b  c  d   interphase chromosomes are about times less compact than mitotic chromosomes but still are about times more compact than a dna molecule in its extended form a   b   c   d    for each of the following sentences choose one of the options enclosed in square brackets to make a correct statement about nucleosomes a nucleosomes are present in procaryoticeucaryotic chromosomes but not in procaryoticeucaryotic chromosomes b a nucleosome contains two molecules each of histones h and haha and hb as well as of histones h and h c a nucleosome core particle contains a core of histone with dna wrapped around it approximately twicethree timesfour times d nucleosomes are aided in their formation by the high proportion of acidicbasicpolar amino acids in histone proteins e nucleosome formation compacts the dna into approximately onethirdonehundredthonethousandth of its original length  the classic “beadsonastring” structure is the most decondensed chromatin structure possible and is produced experimentally which chromatin components are not retained when this structure is generated a linker

only once interphase chromosomes contain both darkly staining  and more lightly staining  genes that are being transcribed are thought to be packaged in a  condensed type of euchromatin nucleosome core particles are separated from each other by stretches of  dna a string of nucleosomes coils up with the help of  to form the more compact structure of the  a  model describes the structure of the  nm fiber the  nm chromatin fiber is further compacted by the formation of  that emanate from a central   nm fiber heterochromatin linker active chromatin histone h loops axis histone h more beadsonastring histone h synaptic complex euchromatin less zigzag  the octameric histone core is composed of four different histone proteins assembled in a stepwise manner once the core octamer has been formed dna wraps around it to form a nucleosome core particle which of the following histone proteins does not form part of the octameric core a h b ha c h d h  the core histones are small basic proteins that have a globular domain at the cterminus and a long extended conformation at the nterminus which of the following is not true of the n terminal “tail” of these histones a it is subject to covalent modifications b it extends out of the nucleosome core c it binds to dna in a sequencespecific manner d it helps dna pack tightly  stepwise condensation of linear dna happens in five different packing processes which of the following four processes has a direct requirement for histone h a formation of “beadsonastring” b formation of the  nm fiber c looping of the  nm fiber d packing of loops to form interphase chromosomes  evidence suggests that the replication of dna packaged into heterochromatin occurs later than the replication of other chromosomal dna what is the simplest possible explanation for this phenomenon the regulation of chromosome structure  although the chromatin structure of interphase and mitotic chromosomes is very compact dnabinding proteins and protein complexes must be able to gain access to the dna molecule chromatinremodeling complexes provide this access by  a recruiting other enzymes b modifying the nterminal tails of core histones c using the energy of atp hydrolysis to move nucleosomes d denaturing the dna by interfering with hydrogenbonding between base pairs  you are studying a newly identified chromatinremodeling complex which you call nicrc you decide to run an in vitro experiment to characterize the activity of the purified complex your molecular toolbox includes  a basepair dna molecule that has a single recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ecori an enzyme that cleaves internal sites on doublestranded dna dsdna  purified ecori enzyme  purified dnase i a dna endonuclease that will cleave dsdna at nonspecific sites if they are exposed and  core octamer histones you are able to assemble core nucleosomes on this dna template and test for nicrc activity figure qa illustrates the dna template used and indicates both the location of the ecori cleavage site and the size of the dna fragments that are produced when it cuts figure qb illustrates how the dna molecules in your experiment looked after separation according to size by using gel electrophoresis your experiment had a total of six samples each of which was treated according to the legend below the gel the sizes of the dna fragments observed are indicated on the left side of the gel figure q a explain the results in lanes – and why it is important to have this information before you begin to test your remodeling complex b what can you conclude about your purified remodeling complex from the results in lanes  and   the nterminal tail of histone h can be extensively modified and depending on the number location and combination of these modifications these changes may promote the formation of heterochromatin what is the result of heterochromatin formation a increase in gene expression b gene silencing c recruitment of remodeling complexes d displacement of histone h  methylation and acetylation are common changes made to histone h and the specific combination of these changes is sometimes referred to as the “histone code” which of the following patterns will probably lead to gene silencing a lysine  methylation b lysine  methylation and lysine  acetylation c lysine  acetylation d lysine  acetylation and lysine  acetylation  when there is a wellestablished segment of heterochromatin on an interphase chromosome there is usually a special barrier sequence that prevents the heterochromatin from expanding along the entire chromosome gene a which is normally expressed has been moved by dna recombination near an area of heterochromatin none of the daughter cells produced after this recombination event express gene a even though its dna sequence is unchanged what is this the best way to describe what has happened to the function of gene a in these cells a barrier destruction b heterochromatization c epigenetic inheritance d euchromatin depletion  your friend is working in a lab to study how yeast cells adapt to growth on different carbon sources he grew half of his cells in the presence of glucose and the other half in the presence of galactose then he harvested the cells and isolated their dna with a gentle procedure that leaves nucleosomes and some higherorder chromatin structures intact he treated the dna briefly with a low concentration of mnuclease a special enzyme that easily degrades proteinfree stretches of dna after removing all the proteins he separated the resulting dna on the basis of length finally he used a procedure to visualize only those dna fragments from a region near a particular gene called sweetie or another gene called salty the separated dna fragments are shown in figure q each vertical column called a lane is from a different sample dna spots near the top of the figure represent dna molecules that are longer than those near the bottom darker spots contain more dna than fainter spots the lanes are as follows  “marker” containing known dna fragments of indicated lengths  cells grown in glucose dna visualized near sweetie gene  cells grown in galactose dna visualized near sweetie gene  cells grown in glucose dna visualized near salty gene  cells grown in galactose dna visualized near salty gene figure q a the lowest spot as observed in lanes   and  has a length of about  nucleotides can you propose what it is and how it arose b what are the spots with longer lengths why is there a ladder of spots c notice the faint spots and extensive smearing in lane  suggesting the dna could be cut almost anywhere near the sweetie gene after growth of the cells in galactose this was not observed in the other lanes what probably happened to the dna to change the pattern between lanes  and  d what kinds of enzyme might have been involved in changing the chromatin structure between lanes  lane  e do you think that gene expression of sweetie is higher lower or the same in galactose compared to glucose what about salty answers  cellfree extracts from sstrain cells of s pneumoniae were fractionated to purify dna rna protein and other cell components each fraction was then mixed with rstrain cells of s pneumoniae its ability to change these into cells with pathogenic properties resembling the sstrain cells was tested by injecting the mixture into mice only the fraction containing dna was able to transform the rstrain cells to pathogenic or sstrain cells that could kill mice  a  b  d  a false dna is doublestranded it is actually is made of two polymers that are complementary in sequence b true c false there are four different nucleotides that are used to make a dna polymer adenine thymine guanine and cytosine a fifth nucleotide uracil is found exclusively in rna molecules replacing thymine nucleotides in the dna sequence d false nucleotides are linked covalently through phosphodiester bonds hydrogenbonding between nucleotides from opposite strands holds the dna molecule together  a  d  d  d  a  see figure a below figure a b the dna base pairs are rotated with respect to each other for a doublestranded dna molecule with  base pairs a full ° rotation has occurred this is referred to as one turn of the helix and it can be seen in the alignment of the at base pair at the bottom with the gc base pair at the top  c  see figure a figure a  a adenine and guanine are purines cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines b cytosine pairs with guanine and adenine with thymine  see figure a figure a  the order in which the dna molecules would denature as the temperature increases is —b —d —c —a all the dna molecules are the same length so only the a  t and g  c content determine their relative tm molecules with higher g  c content will be more stable than molecules with a high a  t content this is because there are three hydrogen bonds between each gc base pair but only two between each at base pair more energy heat is required to disrupt a larger number of hydrogen bonds  a true b false some sequences encode only rna molecules some bind to specific regulatory proteins and others are sites where specific chrosomosomal protein structures are built for example centromeric and telomeric dna c false gene expression is the process of going from gene sequence to rna sequence to protein sequence d false this statement is false for two reasons first genes often contain intron sequences second genes always contain nucleotides flanking the proteincoding sequences that are required for the regulation of transcription and translation  d  b  ′ctacccacgaatgc′  a tm depends on the identity and concentration of other molecules in the solution high salt concentrations are more effective at shielding the two negatively charged phosphatesugar backbones in the double helix from each other so the two strands repel each other less strongly thus a high salt concentration stabilizes the duplex and increases the melting temperature b the tm increases as the proportion of g  c bases increases and as the length increases the thermal energy required for melting depends on how many hydrogen bonds between the strands must be broken each gc base pair contributes three hydrogen bonds whereas an at base pair contributes only two c inserting values into the equation in part b gives tm     ×  –   °c which is about twice the normal temperature of the human body and nearly too hot to touch  a it is better to separate the strands and each take a single strand because all of the information found in the original molecule is preserved in a fulllength single strand but not in a halflength doublestranded molecule b watson and crick meant that the complementary base pairing of the strands allows a single strand to contain all of the information necessary to direct the synthesis of a new complementary strand  a because there are  amino acids used in proteins each amino acid would have to be encoded by a minimum of three nucleotides for example a code of two consecutive nucleotides could specify a maximum of   different amino acids excluding stop and start signals a code of three consecutive nucleotides has   different members and thus can easily accommodate the  amino acids plus a signal to stop protein synthesis b because    different sequences of six nucleotides can occur in dna any given sequence of six nucleotides would be expected to occur on average once in a dna strand  bases long assuming a random distribution of sequences  in eucaryotic chromosomes dna is complexed with proteins to form chromatin the paternal and maternal copies of human chromosome  are homologous whereas the paternal copy of chromosome  and the maternal copy of chromosome  are nonhomologous cytogeneticists can determine largescale chromosomal abnormalities by looking at a patient’s karyotype fluorescent molecules can be used to paint a chromosome by a technique that employs dna hybridization and thereby to identify each chromosome by microscopy  a a gene is a segment of dna that stores the information required to specify the particular sequence found in a protein or in some cases the sequence of a structural or catalytic rna b a similar genome size indicates relatively little about the number of genes and virtually nothing about the number of chromosomes for example the commonly studied yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae sc and schizosaccharomyces pombe sp are separated by roughly  million years of evolution and both have a genome of  million base pairs yet sc has  genes packaged into  chromosomes and sp has  genes in  chromosomes c regions of the chromosome with a high density of genes tend to have about  g  c whereas those with few genes tend to have a lower g  c content this is generally true in most organisms  d  a  ×  m   miles b the earth’s circumference at the equator is  miles the length of dna from the average human body could wrap around the earth  times c the average distance from the earth to the sun is  miles so the roundtrip distance is  miles the length of dna from the average human body could stretch from the earth to the sun and back  times d the distance from the earth to pluto is on average about  ×  miles the length of dna from the average human body could stretch from the earth to pluto and back  times  c  a there are  centromeres per cell one on each chromosome the centromeres have a key role in the distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis b there are  telomeres per cell two on each chromosome telomeres serve to protect the ends of chromosomes and to enable complete replication of the dna of each chromosome all the way to its tips c there are far more than  replication origins in a human cell probably about  these dna sequences direct the initiation of dna synthesis needed to replicate chromosomes  chromosome painting relies on the specificity of dna complementarity because unique sequences for each chromosome are known short dna molecules matching a set of these sites can be designed for each chromosome each set is labeled with a specific combination of fluorescent dyes and then allowed to hybridize form base pairs with the two homologous chromosomes that contain the unique sequences being targeted giemsa stain is a nonfluorescent dye that has a high affinity for dna and specifically accumulates in regions that are rich in at nucleotide pairs this dye produces a pattern of dark and light bands which differ for each chromosome on the basis of the distribution of atrich regions  a false there are several examples of closely related species that have a drastically different number of chromosome pairs two related species of deer—chinese and indian muntjac—have  and  respectively b true c true d false the telomere is a specialized dna sequence but not for the attachment of spindle microtubules telomeres form special caps that stabilize the ends of linear chromosomes  each chromosome is a single molecule of dna whose extraordinarily long length can be compacted by as much as fold during interphase and tenfold more during mitosis this is accomplished by binding to proteins that help package the dna in an orderly manner so it can fit in the small space delimited by the nuclear envelope the structure of the dna–protein complex called chromatin is highly dynamic over time  a  b  a  b  a nucleosomes are present in eucaryotic chromosomes but not in procaryotic chromosomes b a nucleosome contains two molecules each of histones ha and hb as well as histones h and h c a nucleosome core particle contains a core of histone with dna wrapped around it approximately twice d nucleosomes are aided in their formation by the high proportion of basic amino acids in histone proteins e nucleosome formation compacts dna into approximately onethird of its original length  a  c  interphase chromosomes contain both darkly staining heterochromatin and more lightly staining euchromatin genes that are being transcribed are thought to be packaged in a less condensed type of euchromatin nucleosome core particles are separated from each other by stretches of linker dna a string of nucleosomes coils up with the help of histone h to form the more compact structure of the  nm fiber a zigzag model describes the structure of the  nm fiber the  nm chromatin fiber is further compacted by the formation of loops that emanate from a central axis  d  c  b  the dna double helix in heterochromatin may be so tightly packed and condensed that it is inaccessible to the proteins that bind replication origins including the dna replication machinery it may take extra time to remodel the chromatin to make it more accessible to the proteins required to initiate and perform dna replication  c  a sample  confirms the location of the ecori restriction site and shows what those fragments should look like when separated on the gel the cleavage is the readout that will tell us whether the remodeling complex is working sample  demonstrates that dna that is not assembled into nucleosomes can be cut into many small fragments by dnasei that is why we do not see discrete bands sample  demonstrates that when nucleosomes are assembled on the dna dnase i cuts only in one place presumably in the linker region between two assembled nucleosomes sample  demonstrates that ecori cannot access its cleavage site when nucleosomes are assembled over it b sample  demonstrates that our purified complex is working it must be moving the nucleosomes providing access to ecori such that it can now cleave at its restriction site which was not possible in the absence of nicrc sample  shows that nicrc will function only if atp is available as an energy source for the remodeling process  b  a  c  a the lowest spot represents dna of a length similar to that of the segment of dna found in a nucleosome core particle partial digestion with an enzyme such as mnuclease causes breaks in the dna backbone primarily within the linker dna or other dna segments not bound tightly to histones thus this band probably comprises the dna bound tightly to a single histone octamer and it arose by cutting the linker dna outside a single nucleosome core particle b the ladder of bands with longer lengths probably corresponds to stretches of dna associated with increasing numbers of nucleosomes      and so on in support of this proposal adjacent bands differ in size by roughly  nucleotides which is the length of dna found in a nucleosome core particle plus neighboring linker dna this interpretation must mean that the mnuclease digestion did not go to completion because if all nonnucleosomal dna were digested completely the samples would contain only the basepair fragment c given the ability of mnuclease to cut anywhere near sweetie after growth in galactose it seems that the dna is no longer protected from digestion by binding to histones perhaps the wrapping of dna within the nucleosomes has been loosened considerably this change in the nucleosomes must be specific to the sweetie gene because it is not seen at the salty gene or throughout the genome d the main candidates for enzymes that catalyzed the nucleosome alterations near sweetie are chromatinremodeling complexes and enzymes that covalently modify histone tails with methyl acetyl or phosphate groups e as the chromatin seems to have been loosened near sweetie it seems likely that sweetie gene expression is increased when cells are grown in galactose rather than glucose whereas salty gene expression is likely to be the same under the two conditions perhaps the sweetie gene contains instructions for a protein that is required for cells to metabolize galactose but not glucose figure a

science and education at the university of california san francisco to which he returned after serving two sixyear terms as the president of the national academy of sciences nas during his tenure at the nas alberts was instrumental in developing the landmark national science education standards that have been implemented in school systems nationwide the type of “science as inquiry” teaching we need says alberts emphasizes “logical handson problem solving and it insists on having evidence for claims that can be confirmed by others it requires work in cooperative groups where those with different types of talents can discover them – developing self confidence and an ability to communicate effectively with others” alberts is also noted as one of the original authors of the molecular biology of the cell a preeminent textbook in the field soon to be in its sixth edition for the period  to  he served as the cochair of the interacademy council a new organization in amsterdam governed by the presidents of  national academies of sciences and established to provide scientific advice to the world committed in his international work to the promotion of the “creativity openness and tolerance that are inherent to science” alberts believes that “scientists all around the world must now band together to help create more rational scientificallybased societies that find dogmatism intolerable” widely recognized for his work in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology alberts has earned many honors and awards including  honorary degrees he currently serves on the

sequences annotate the bottom panel to show regions of synteny figure q  the dynamics of nucleosomes can be studied in a test tube by mixing histone proteins with short pieces of dna to form a single nucleosome on each dna molecule when a dye molecule is covalently linked to one end of the dna and a complementary dye molecule is linked to a histone protein the proximity of the two dyes can be measured such measurements combined with other experiments suggested that nucleosomes alternated between two states one fully wrapped w and the second partly unwrapped u the equilibrium constant between these two states keq  uw depends on the concentration of salt in the test tube at the salt concentration found in cells the keq was between  and  a about what percentage of the time is a given nucleosome partly unwrapped at this salt concentration explain b will increasing the salt concentration increase or decrease the keq explain  when placed on an agar slab and incubated at °c for  days a single yeast cell proliferates into a colony with a diameter of  mm containing  yeast cells if the cell has a functional ade gene ade the colony will be white if ade is nonfunctional ade– the colony will be red you take a strain with a mutant ade– at the regular chromosomal position red colonies and insert a second functional ade gene near the telomere you find that the colonies are a mixture of red and white patches or sectors figure q shows some colonies the black regions represent the red sectors a explain what happened to the ade gene near the telomere in the red cells and in the white cells what is the term for this phenomenon b you take single cells from the white sectors and allow them to form new colonies you do the same with cells from the red sectors predict the color of the colonies explain c you measure acetylation of the ntermini of histones h and h that are located near the telomeric ade do you expect more or less acetylation in the red cells than in the white cells d you look for mutants that give only white colonies you find mutations in three genes rap which encodes a protein that binds specific short dna sequences near the telomere sir which encodes a histone deacetlyase and sir which encodes a protein that binds rap sir and deacetylated ntermini of histones h and h propose a series of events in which these proteins act together to turn a white cell into a red cell figure q  you want to examine where within the cell a protein called tip resides to do this you make a dna construct containing regulatory sequences rs that control gene expression the proteincoding region of the tip gene and a sequence that codes for green fluorescent protein gfp the expressed fusion protein includes the tip protein covalently linked at one end to gfp and therefore you can visualize the subcellular location of tip by viewing green fluorescence with a microscope you transfect mouse cells with the rstipgfp construct and find cells in which the constructs have been inserted in the genome at random you look at  colonies each arising from an independent insertion and find that some colonies contain cells that all have high levels of fluorescence whereas other colonies have only cells with moderate or low levels two colonies even have a mixture of cells some with high levels of fluorescence and others with low levels a explain the observed differences between colonies and for each observed colony behavior b propose an improved version of your rstipgfp construct that might make the colonies more uniform list the order of sequences in the improved construct  you want to investigate the substructure of an intact interphase nucleus to do this you fix cells and isolate their nuclei you add fluorescent antibodies that bind specifically to particular proteins and then observe fluorescence with a microscope a nucleus is represented in figure q which of the proteins listed below do you expect to be concentrated in a subnuclear region indicate on the figure where you expect those proteins to localize proteins hp histone h acetylated on lysine  histone h methylated on lysine  histone h and condensin figure q  gene duplication is widely believed to be a major mechanism for generating genetic novelty and increased biological complexity a how does a pseudogene arise b identify the simplest kind of experiment to begin characterizing the divergence of a pair of functional genes that arose from an ancient duplication event and describe what results are expected c because of the availability of wholegenome dna sequences and wholegenome gene expression measurements researchers classify each gene as a member of a duplicated set or a singleton and then evaluate whether there is a difference between expression patterns of the two classes which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between strains of an organism which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between different stages in embryogenesis explain  a hypothetical phylogenetic tree is shown in figure q use this tree to answer the following questions a how many years ago did species m and n diverge from their last common ancestor b how much nucleotide divergence is there on average between m and n c are m and n more or less closely related to each other than p and s d in looking for functionally important nucleotide sequences is it more informative to compare the genome sequences of m and n or those of m and q explain figure q  consider a gene with a particular function mutation x and mutation y separately cause defects in the function of the encoded protein yet a gene containing both mutations x and y encodes a protein that works even better than the original protein the odds that a single mutational event will generate both mutations x and y are exceedingly small explain a simple way in which an organism with a mutant gene containing both mutations x and y could arise during evolution answers  figure a  a the percentage of the time is – an equilibrium constant between  and  means that at a given instant – of the nucleosomes are partly unwrapped because the question said that each nucleosome alternates between the two states the previous sentence can be transformed to say that a single nucleosome spends – of the time in a partly unwrapped state b increase a higher salt concentration will disrupt the nucleosomes because they are held together largely by ionic interactions between the positively charged histone proteins and the negatively charged dna this will lead to more unwrapped nucleosomes and fewer wrapped nucleosomes which will increase the keq reference li g widom j  nucleosomes facilitate their own invasion natstruct mol biol  –  a in the white cells the inserted ade gene is expressed and the ade protein is made in the red cells the inserted ade gene has undergone gene silencing probably as a result of spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere this is called positioneffect variegation b the cells from both colors of sectors will generate new colonies that are also sectored colonies from red cells may tend to have more red than white colonies from white cells may have more white than red the ade gene in white cells is probably packaged in euchromatin and in red cells in heterochromatin the chromatin state of a genomic locus is often directly inherited during the process of dna replication causing a phenomenon called epigenetic inheritance so red white cells will tend to make more red white cells but with positioneffect variegation there is a certain low frequency of switching of chromatin from a repressed to an expressed state and vice versa so red white cells can become white red c more histone acetylation will occur near the telomeric ade in the cells that actively express the gene that is in the white cells expressed regions of the genome are enriched in acetylated histones d a white cell is turned into a red cell by spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere to the ade inserted nearby the spreading might happen as follows  rap binds a site in the telomeric region  sir binds to rap and recruits sir  sir deacetylates histones near rap  more sir binds to the deacetylated histones and recruits more sir  sir deacetylates more histones farther from the rapbinding site  repeat steps  and  for many cycles in a chain reaction until the deacetylation reaches the ade gene deacetylated histones are components of heterochromatin and they may recruit other histonemodifying enzymes histonebinding proteins and chromatinremodeling complexes  a the differences between the colonies probably arise from position effects the construct might have inserted near sequence elements and chromatin structures that enhance gene expression high fluorescence have no effect on gene expression high or moderate fluorescence repress gene expression low fluorescence or spread heterochromatin into the inserted construct variable fluorescence the colonies with mixed populations of cells probably contain the construct inserted near heterochromatin which spreads into the construct in some cells but not others b the construct might confer more uniform gene expression independently of where it inserted in the genome if it contained barrier sequences barrier sequences like hs from the chicken betaglobin locus normally separate an active chromatin domain from a silenced chromatin domain barrier sequences bss can insulate a dna construct from position effects if they flank the important sequences on both sides an improved construct containing bsrstipgfpbs might yield more uniform expression among and within the colonies  see figure a methylated histone h and hp are associated with silenced or heterochromatic regions of chromatin acetylated histone h is associated with actively expressed regions of chromatin histone h and condensin are not indicated in the figure because histone h is everywhere and condensin is only localized to chromosomes in mitosis not in interphase figure a  a creation of a pseudogene starts when a gene is duplicated next a random mutation inactivates or impairs one of the copies it is unlikely that the mutation has detrimental consequences for the cell or the organism because there is a second fully functional copy the mutated copy may continue to accumulate additional mutations without detrimental consequences and it may lose all functionality and perhaps even lose the ability to be expressed a nonfunctional gene is called a pseudogene b the simplest kind of experiment is a comparison of the expression patterns of the duplicated genes after duplication genes commonly diverge in their expression pattern the expectation then is that the mrna and the proteins encoded by the duplicated genes will be observed at different developmental stages or in different tissues or cell types or at different stages of the celldivision cycle or in different subcellular compartments c the answer to both questions is duplicated genes not singletons genes that are part of a duplicated or expanded set are more likely to exhibit more narrowly specialized expression duplicated genes that diverge are more likely to survive through evolutionary time because there will be detrimental consequences for loss of each gene one simple way to diverge such that both copies of a pair will be required is for random mutations of regulatory regions to generate differences in when and where each gene is turned on  a m and n diverged  million years ago b there is an average of  nucleotide substitution in m compared with n follow the path connecting the two species which is twice the distance between each one and their common ancestor c more however they show roughly the same degree of relatedness the sequence divergence between m and n is about  whereas that between p and s is about  m and n diverged  million years ago whereas p and s diverged  million years ago d it is more informative to compare species that are separated by a greater evolutionary distance comparing m and q which diverged  million years ago will therefore be better able to identify sequences likely to be important for function closely related species share many sequences by chance because insufficient time has passed for neutral mutations to accumulate  the simplest way to evolve the new gene is by duplication and divergence if the gene is duplicated then the cell or lineage can maintain one functional intact copy of the original gene and can thus tolerate a disabling mutation in the second copy the second copy can initially be modified by the x or y mutation that impairs its function at some later time many generations later the gene with the single mutation can acquire the additional mutation to yield the doubly mutant xy gene with the new or improved function reviews there are no reviews yet be the

bruce alberts chapter  cells and genomes questions  your friend studies the sars virus and tells you that the sars virus packages its genetic material as a positivestrand singlestranded rna a positivestrand rna is an rna molecule that can serve as a translatable template to produce protein given what you know about the production of nucleic acids in cells would you expect that the positivestrand rna molecule could be used as a template to produce other positivestrand rna molecules or would you expect that another nucleic acid intermediary would have to be produced first explain  you are interested in studying hiv on reading the literature you learn that the genetic information for the hiv virus is a singlestranded rna molecule given what you know about the properties of nucleic acids would you expect the ratios of purines to pyrimidine bases in the hiv viral rna to be the same as the ratio found in the hereditary information of all living cells explain  you have two computer files one containing the complete escherichia coli bacterial genomic sequence and the other containing the complete drosophila melanogaster fruit fly genomic sequence a new student in the lab made a mistake and renamed the files “a” and “b” however you do know that file a is  kilobytes while file b is  megabytes in size without opening the file and examining the sequence can you predict which file is more likely to contain the genomic sequence for e coli and which file contains the genomic sequence for drosophila explain  you have two tubes tube  contains the dna encoding the genome of a human being and tube  contains the dna encoding the genome of a lithotrophic archaean that lives adjacent to a deepsea hydrothermal vent that has an average temperature of °c note that normal human body temperature is °c you lend your tubes to a chemist friend who loses the label on your tubes however he was able to determine the percentage molar ratios of as and ts in these tubes and finds that the dna in tube  is composed of  as and ts while the dna in tube  is composed of  as and ts which tube contains the human dna and which tube contains the archaean dna explain  the adult human intestine contains hundreds of species of bacteria and these bacteria often have specialized niches within the intestine members of the bacteriodetes genus are common members of the intestinal flora and the genomes of several species within this genus have been sequenced including a species b dulcis that is particularly capable of digesting plant polysaccharides when the sequences of the bacteriodetes species were compared it was found that orthologous genes had between  to  amino acid identity between species b dulcis was found to have a set of genes encoding enzymes important for polysaccharide degradation that did not exist in the other species interestingly sequence comparisons of these polysaccharidedegrading genes suggested that the closest relatives of these genes were in archaea and not in bacteria provide two possible explanations for how this set of genes could have arisen  it is now generally accepted that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as freeliving bacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral eucaryotic cell however it is also known that the mitochondrial dna and the chloroplast dna lack genes for many essential functions this means that were the mitochondria or the chloroplast to “escape” the modern day eucaryotic cell the mitochondria or the chloroplasts could not survive on their own explain what has happened that allows the mitochondria and chloroplasts to survive in the host cell even though they lack the dna encoding essential genes in their dna  your friend obtained the sequence of an mrna that encodes a gene important for tooth formation in cheetahs since she knows that the us in an mrna sequence were encoded by corresponding ts in the dna she changes the us in the mrna to ts and uses this nucleotide sequence to search the published genomic sequence of humans for a homologous gene her database search identifies a region of human dna that has  identity with the cheetah nucleotide sequence meaning if you line up the two nucleotide sequences  of the corresponding bases are exactly the same however when she showed this human dna region to her boss her boss took a quick look and told her that her search had not identified a homologous gene and that there was a better way to conduct her search she has not yet taken cell biology and turns to you for help given your knowledge of how a cell encodes and uses genetic information devise a better strategy for using this nucleotide sequence to identify the homologous gene in humans  explain what an amphipathic molecule is and why in an aqueous solution a bilayer of amphipathic molecules selfaggregates to form a vesicle that contains water whereas a monolayer of amphipathic molecules selfaggregates into a sphere that excludes water chapter  cell chemistry and biosynthesis questions  a major goal of interplanetary research is to find evidence of water on other planets in the search for extraterrestrial life all known life requires water a describe three properties of water that make it uniquely suited for life in one or two sentences describe each property and a consequence of that property for cells or organisms b both c–h bonds and o–h bonds have special properties that make life possible what is the most notable difference between a c–h bond and an o–h bond why is this difference important is an n–h bond more like an o–h bond or a c–h bond c in the search for interplanetary life scientists are designing detection methods for an unmanned rover that can be used to identify five kinds of biomolecules name four of these five critical biomolecules  your friend learns about avogadro’s number and thinks it is so huge that there may not even be a mole of living cells on earth you have recently heard that there are about  trillion  ´  human cells in each adult human body so you bet your friend  that there is more than a mole of cells on earth once you learn that each human contains more bacterial cells in the digestive system than human cells you are sure that you have won the bet in the year  the human population surpassed  billion  ´  what calculation can you show your friend to convince him you are right  your friend challenges you to a bet he says that cola is so sweet that the sugar molecules in cola are more crowded than people packed into a  airplane after an uncomfortable crosscountry airplane trip you think this cannot be true cola has  grams of sugar in  ml  m sugar a person is roughly  ´  times larger than a sugar molecule so scaling a person down to the size of a sugar molecule would correspondingly scale down the cabin volume of a  from about a million liters to  ´  liters the maximum capacity of a  is  people which is more crowded the sugar molecules in soda or the passengers on a  what is the molarity of people on a  using the scaling described  the yeast species saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used to brew beer and leaven bread the latin words of the species name mean “sugar fungus” and “beer” in making bread and beer the yeast converts sugars to carbon dioxide which forms bubbles that cause dough to rise and ethanol which gives beer its alcoholic punch from the facts about sugar metabolism you can explain to your friends how the alcohol and carbon dioxide arise in glycolysis a glucose molecule is converted into two pyruvate molecules see figure q a yeast can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen aerobically or anaerobically respectively does glycolysis oxidize glucose can cells growing anaerobically perform glycolysis explain b pyruvate can be converted to acetyl coa or ethanol acetyl coa then enters the citric acid cycle ethanol is not metabolized further use chemical formulas to show what happens to the three carbon molecules in pyruvate in each case when both reactions are complete drawn as in figure q c is more ethanol made if yeast grows aerobically or anaerobically is more co made if yeast grows aerobically or anaerobically explain d bread yeast strains have been optimized for their task what do you think would happen if you brewed beer using bread yeast e some yeast called rho– have defective mitochondria unlike the functional wildtype rho yeast a friend gave you a rho– strain and a rho strain but forgot to label the strains what carbon source would you use to determine the identities of the strains name a carbon source that will allow both strains to grow and one that will allow only one to grow and indicate which will grow figure q  lysine and glutamate are amino acids that are often positively and negatively charged respectively in proteins in the cell a the neutral forms are shown in figure q write the charged forms of the amino acids b consider a protein that has eight lysines and five glutamates and no other potentially charged amino acids what will be the net charge on the protein when it is dissolved in a solution at ph  at ph  at ph  c histidine is usually neutral at high ph and charged at low ph when incorporated in a protein its pka is about  roughly what percentage of histidines will be charged in a solution at ph  at ph  at ph  figure q  consider the reaction x ® y in a cell at °c at equilibrium the concentrations of x and y are  mm and  mm respectively dg°  – ln keq dg  dg°   ln yx the natural log of a number z will be negative when z   positive when z   and  when z   a what is the value of keq for this reaction b is the standard freeenergy change of this reaction positive or negative is the reaction x ® y an energetically favorable or unfavorable reaction under standard conditions c imagine circumstances in which the concentration of x is  mm and y is  mm is a net conversion of x to y favorable for a given x molecule will it be converted to a y molecule quickly explain d consider  mm of y added to a test tube with  mm of x that contains a radioactive atom to allow tracing of the individual atoms the mixture is incubated for  hours before separating y from x and measuring the radioactivity of y does the information provided allow you to determine whether the y molecules contain any radioactivity if the reaction also contained an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of x and y would the y molecules be radioactive explain e imagine starting conditions in which the reaction x ® y is unfavorable yet the cell needs to produce more y describe two ways in which this may be accomplished  many critical molecules in cells are polymers which is more disordered a polymer or a collection of monomers on the basis of your answer is the dg° of a condensation reaction positive negative or zero what about the dg° of a hydrolysis reaction is a condensation or a hydrolysis reaction usually coupled to a reaction involving atp or another activated carrier molecule  the energetic trajectory of a series of reactions in a catabolic pathway can be plotted on a graph like that in figure q the graph shows a hypothetical pathway similar to glycolysis in which the catabolic intermediates are designated a b c etc the energetic contributions of activated carrier molecules have been omitted from this energy plot which reaction is most likely to occur without an enzyme which reaction is most likely to be catalyzed by an enzyme that simultaneously uses atp as a substrate which reaction is most likely to be catalyzed by an enzyme that simultaneously uses adp as a substrate and produces atp which reaction can most readily be driven by a subsequent reaction that acts as a siphon on the product for each of the four answers explain your reasoning figure q chapter  proteins questions  the table lists the average strengths of noncovalent bonds table q protein lock binds to protein key in a reaction with g°  – kcalmol when these proteins bind  å of the surface of lock is closely apposed to the same area on the surface of key so that water is excluded a estimate how much of the binding energy the van der waals interactions contribute for this calculation assume that an average atom has a surface area of  å b if hydrogen bonds contribute the remaining binding energy between amino acids estimate how many hydrogen bonds form between lock and key does it depend on whether the hydrogenbonded amino acids occur within the buried surface or elsewhere in the proteins explain  consider a protein x that is known to exist in two slightly different conformations called x and x proteins a b and c are ligands that can bind to protein x the sites on x required for binding to a b and c are located in different regions of the protein on the basis of experimental evidence of protein–protein complexes you devise the hypothetical binding reaction scheme shown in figure q according to the hypothesis which pairs of binding sites on x exhibit negative coupling negative linkage which pairs exhibit positive coupling positive linkage does the addition of a high concentration of protein a increase or decrease the affinity of x for b of x for c figure q  you are working in a laboratory trying to understand how cells change shape in response to treatment with a particular chemical on treatment normal wildtype cells convert from a flattened irregular shape to a rounded nearly spherical shape previously another student in the laborator identified a mutant that remained flat after treatment the gene that encodes the normal protein is called flat and the mutant gene is designated flat– to identify additional genes responsible for this behavior you mutagenize flat– cells and look for those that can respond normally to stimulation you identify cells that contain a “suppressor” mutation in a second gene called supr– that restores the wildtype behavior to cells with the flat– mutation further genetic manipulation and dna sequencing reveals the data shown in the table below initially you are surprised to find that cells containing a mutation in supr– and a normal copy of flat have the same mutant behavior as cells containing only a flat– mutation however when you examine the nature of the amino acids that are changed in the mutants you instantly suggest a hypothesis to account for the observations what is your hypothesis what biochemical experiment with purified proteins will test your hypothesis what biochemical results would support the hypothesis table q  the src protein kinase is composed of several domains that interact to control the behavior of the protein figure q a and b shows the structure of the repressed conformation of src in  long before the xray crystal structure of src was known scientists used a technique called partial proteolysis to explore the structure of src treatment with small amounts of the v protease cleaved src at a single location to generate two protein fragments the addition of more v protease caused further cleavage of one of the fragments but in both cases kinase activity was maintained figure qc shows a protein gel from this experiment the proteolytic fragments are detected by their radioactivity because the src protein contained radioactive atoms in some reactions src was radiolabelled throughout its length “all” and in others the radiolabel was only at the nterminal end “end” a indicate on the ribbon diagram where you think cleavage first occurs to generate the  kd and  kd fragments circle and label the regions corresponding to each fragment b which fragment contains the kinase domain on the basis of the regulation of src explained in the textbook would you have expected this fragment to be active as a kinase as observed if so do you expect the kinase activity be greater than the same as or less than that of the intact protein explain c dephosphorylation mutation or deletion of a particular tyrosine residue in the cterminal tail of the protein leads to increased activity of the kinase and promotes cancerous transformation of cells do you expect the proteolytic fragment containing the kinase domain to be regulated strongly by phosphorylation of the key tyrosine in the cterminal tail explain figure q  antibodies raised against proteins of interest are useful tools for biomedical research because they allow the visualization or isolation of individual proteins from a complex mixture of different proteins a western blot wb is one method of visualizing proteins all proteins are extracted from cells the proteins are denatured and separated by size using electrophoresis through a gel and the protein of interest is detected by binding to an antibody that is linked to a fluorescent or luminescent molecule immunofluorescence if provides a way to visualize a particular protein within a cell using microscopy the cell is “fixed” killed and preserved intact flooded with an antibody that binds a protein of interest and washed free of unbound antibody because the antibody is also bound to a fluorescent molecule the subcellular location and intensity of the fluorescence indicates the location and concentration of the protein of interest unfortunately many antibodies that work well for wb are not useful for if consider an antibody that yields an intense signal located at the expected position on a wb when the wb is performed with cells lacking the protein of interest the intense signal is absent but there remain a few faint signals from nonspecific proteins of the wrong size yet this antibody is not useful for if because in if the wildtype cells and the cells lacking the protein of interest look the same suggest two possible explanations for the observation that the antibody is more specific in a wb than in an if experiment note that at least five explanations are possible  immunoprecipitation ip is commonly used in biomedical research to examine whether proteins interact physically with each other you perform an ip procedure to determine if a protein called elm interacts with proteins called oak and red first you link an elmspecific antibody to small beads that settle out of solution readily second you grind up cells extract the soluble proteins add the beads and incubate for  hours third you centrifuge the mixture to separate the beads from the unbound proteins fourth you wash the beads three times to remove weakly bound proteins to do this you add a large volume of buffer to the beads incubate for  minutes then remove the buffer finally you add detergent to the beads to denature and dissociate all proteins before separating them on a gel and revealing them with additional specific antibodies because you do not have antibodies against oak and red you genetically engineer cells in which both of these proteins are fused to a small protein handle or tag called ha for which you purchase specific antibodies your gel is shown in figure q a your lab partner chris looks at your gel and says that you have evidence that elm binds directly to oak and to red do you agree is there a plausible alternative interpretation of your data b chris says that your data demonstrate that elm oak and red form a threeprotein complex do you agree explain c assume that you have solid evidence that elm binds directly to oak and it also binds directly to red chris says that elm has higher affinity for red has a lower kd than it has for oak do you agree explain with reference to an equation for kd figure q  by computational analysis of genome sequences you discover a new protein family with members from many different eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms but nothing is known about the functions of these proteins you suspect that these proteins may share a previously unknown protein fold and thus you wish to determine the xray crystal structure of a member of this family because the most challenging steps in structural determination are the production of very pure concentrated protein and the formation of crystals in which protein molecules pack closely together in a uniform conformation you need to choose carefully which member of the family to use for structural experiments you decide to use a procaryotic protein because it is easier to get large amounts of protein you narrow the choice to family members from the model organism e coli the pathogenic diseasecausing organism yersinia pestis the thermophilic heat loving organism thermus aquaticus and the halophilic salt loving organism haloquadratum walsbyi you will overexpress one of these proteins in e coli from recombinant dna which one is likely to be easier to purify and to be more energetically stable and conformationally uniform under the crystallization conditions explain  members of the mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk family are essential for many responses to the extracellular environment a mapk becomes active after it becomes phosphorylated by a second kinase these mapks contain a “docking site” distant from the active site that binds to conserved – amino acid “docking motifs” found in a variety of proteins see figure q docking motifs are found in proteins that bind mapks scaffold proteins proteins that are substrates of mapks proteins that activate mapks by phosphorylating them mapk kinases and proteins that inactivate mapks by dephosphorylating them phosphatases the kinetic properties of a particular mapk were measured with a small peptide substrate that contains only the preferred phosphorylation site the km is  nm and the kcat is sec do you expect the kcat for the natural protein substrate to be higher or lower than that for the peptide substrate what about the km explain with reference to the reaction shown in panel a below figure q chapter  dna chromosomes and genomes questions  figure q shows a hypothetical alignment of nucleotide sequences from two organisms the bottom panel shows an alignment of large chromosomal regions with black blocks representing dna stretches of at least  nucleotides for which there is a corresponding sequence somewhere in the other organism’s genome gray lines connect the pairs of corresponding sequences found in this alignment region the top panel shows a magnified view of one region approximately the length of an average gene here each vertical gray line represents a stretch of six nucleotides in which five of the six are identical between the two species annotate the top panel of the figure to indicate likely locations of exons introns and regulatory sequences annotate the bottom panel to show regions of synteny figure q  the dynamics of nucleosomes can be studied in a test tube by mixing histone proteins with short pieces of dna to form a single nucleosome on each dna molecule when a dye molecule is covalently linked to one end of the dna and a complementary dye molecule is linked to a histone protein the proximity of the two dyes can be measured such measurements combined with other experiments suggested that nucleosomes alternated between two states one fully wrapped w and the second partly unwrapped u the equilibrium constant between these two states keq  uw depends on the concentration of salt in the test tube at the salt concentration found in cells the keq was between  and  a about what percentage of the time is a given nucleosome partly unwrapped at this salt concentration explain b will increasing the salt concentration increase or decrease the keq explain  when placed on an agar slab and incubated at °c for  days a single yeast cell proliferates into a colony with a diameter of  mm containing  yeast cells if the cell has a functional ade gene ade the colony will be white if ade is nonfunctional ade– the colony will be red you take a strain with a mutant ade– at the regular chromosomal position red colonies and insert a second functional ade gene near the telomere you find that the colonies are a mixture of red and white patches or sectors figure q shows some colonies the black regions represent the red sectors a explain what happened to the ade gene near the telomere in the red cells and in the white cells what is the term for this phenomenon b you take single cells from the white sectors and allow them to form new colonies you do the same with cells from the red sectors predict the color of the colonies explain c you measure acetylation of the ntermini of histones h and h that are located near the telomeric ade do you expect more or less acetylation in the red cells than in the white cells d you look for mutants that give only white colonies you find mutations in three genes rap which encodes a protein that binds specific short dna sequences near the telomere sir which encodes a histone deacetlyase and sir which encodes a protein that binds rap sir and deacetylated ntermini of histones h and h propose a series of events in which these proteins act together to turn a white cell into a red cell figure q  you want to examine where within the cell a protein called tip resides to do this you make a dna construct containing regulatory sequences rs that control gene expression the proteincoding region of the tip gene and a sequence that codes for green fluorescent protein gfp the expressed fusion protein includes the tip protein covalently linked at one end to gfp and therefore you can visualize the subcellular location of tip by viewing green fluorescence with a microscope you transfect mouse cells with the rstipgfp construct and find cells in which the constructs have been inserted in the genome at random you look at  colonies each arising from an independent insertion and find that some colonies contain cells that all have high levels of fluorescence whereas other colonies have only cells with moderate or low levels two colonies even have a mixture of cells some with high levels of fluorescence and others with low levels a explain the observed differences between colonies and for each observed colony behavior b propose an improved version of your rstipgfp construct that might make the colonies more uniform list the order of sequences in the improved construct  you want to investigate the substructure of an intact interphase nucleus to do this you fix cells and isolate their nuclei you add fluorescent antibodies that bind specifically to particular proteins and then observe fluorescence with a microscope a nucleus is represented in figure q which of the proteins listed below do you expect to be concentrated in a subnuclear region indicate on the figure where you expect those proteins to localize proteins hp histone h acetylated on lysine  histone h methylated on lysine  histone h and condensin figure q  gene duplication is widely believed to be a major mechanism for generating genetic novelty and increased biological complexity a how does a pseudogene arise b identify the simplest kind of experiment to begin characterizing the divergence of a pair of functional genes that arose from an ancient duplication event and describe what results are expected c because of the availability of wholegenome dna sequences and wholegenome gene expression measurements researchers classify each gene as a member of a duplicated set or a singleton and then evaluate whether there is a difference between expression patterns of the two classes which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between strains of an organism which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between different stages in embryogenesis explain  a hypothetical phylogenetic tree is shown in figure q use this tree to answer the following questions a how many years ago did species m and n diverge from their last common ancestor b how much nucleotide divergence is there on average between m and n c are m and n more or less closely related to each other than p and s d in looking for functionally important nucleotide sequences is it more informative to compare the genome sequences of m and n or those of m and q explain figure q  consider a gene with a particular function mutation x and mutation y separately cause defects in the function of the encoded protein yet a gene containing both mutations x and y encodes a protein that works even better than the original protein the odds that a single mutational event will generate both mutations x and y are exceedingly small explain a simple way in which an organism with a mutant gene containing both mutations x and y could arise during evolution answers  figure a  a the percentage of the time is – an equilibrium constant between  and  means that at a given instant – of the nucleosomes are partly unwrapped because the question said that each nucleosome alternates between the two states the previous sentence can be transformed to say that a single nucleosome spends – of the time in a partly unwrapped state b increase a higher salt concentration will disrupt the nucleosomes because they are held together largely by ionic interactions between the positively charged histone proteins and the negatively charged dna this will lead to more unwrapped nucleosomes and fewer wrapped nucleosomes which will increase the keq reference li g widom j  nucleosomes facilitate their own invasion natstruct mol biol  –  a in the white cells the inserted ade gene is expressed and the ade protein is made in the red cells the inserted ade gene has undergone gene silencing probably as a result of spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere this is called positioneffect variegation b the cells from both colors of sectors will generate new colonies that are also sectored colonies from red cells may tend to have more red than white colonies from white cells may have more white than red the ade gene in white cells is probably packaged in euchromatin and in red cells in heterochromatin the chromatin state of a genomic locus is often directly inherited during the process of dna replication causing a phenomenon called epigenetic inheritance so red white cells will tend to make more red white cells but with positioneffect variegation there is a certain low frequency of switching of chromatin from a repressed to an expressed state and vice versa so red white cells can become white red c more histone acetylation will occur near the telomeric ade in the cells that actively express the gene that is in the white cells expressed regions of the genome are enriched in acetylated histones d a white cell is turned into a red cell by spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere to the ade inserted nearby the spreading might happen as follows  rap binds a site in the telomeric region  sir binds to rap and recruits sir  sir deacetylates histones near rap  more sir binds to the deacetylated histones and recruits more sir  sir deacetylates more histones farther from the rapbinding site  repeat steps  and  for many cycles in a chain reaction until the deacetylation reaches the ade gene deacetylated histones are components of heterochromatin and they may recruit other histonemodifying enzymes histonebinding proteins and chromatinremodeling complexes  a the differences between the colonies probably arise from position effects the construct might have inserted near sequence elements and chromatin structures that enhance gene expression high fluorescence have no effect on gene expression high or moderate fluorescence repress gene expression low fluorescence or spread heterochromatin into the inserted construct variable fluorescence the colonies with mixed populations of cells probably contain the construct inserted near heterochromatin which spreads into the construct in some cells but not others b the construct might confer more uniform gene expression independently of where it inserted in the genome if it contained barrier sequences barrier sequences like hs from the chicken betaglobin locus normally separate an active chromatin domain from a silenced chromatin domain barrier sequences bss can insulate a dna construct from position effects if they flank the important sequences on both sides an improved construct containing bsrstipgfpbs might yield more uniform expression among and within the colonies  see figure a methylated histone h and hp are associated with silenced or heterochromatic regions of chromatin acetylated histone h is associated with actively expressed regions of chromatin histone h and condensin are not indicated in the figure because histone h is everywhere and condensin is only localized to chromosomes in mitosis not in interphase figure a  a creation of a pseudogene starts when a gene is duplicated next a random mutation inactivates or impairs one of the copies it is unlikely that the mutation has detrimental consequences for the cell or the organism because there is a second fully functional copy the mutated copy may continue to accumulate additional mutations without detrimental consequences and it may lose all functionality and perhaps even lose the ability to be expressed a nonfunctional gene is called a pseudogene b the simplest kind of experiment is a comparison of the expression patterns of the duplicated genes after duplication genes commonly diverge in their expression pattern the expectation then is that the mrna and the proteins encoded by the duplicated genes will be observed at different developmental stages or in different tissues or cell types or at different stages of the celldivision cycle or in different subcellular compartments c the answer to both questions is duplicated genes not singletons genes that are part of a duplicated or expanded set are more likely to exhibit more narrowly specialized expression duplicated genes that diverge are more likely to survive through evolutionary time because there will be detrimental consequences for loss of each gene one simple way to diverge such that both copies of a pair will be required is for random mutations of regulatory regions to generate differences in when and where each gene is turned on  a m and n diverged  million years ago b there is an average of  nucleotide substitution in m compared with n follow the path connecting the two species which is twice the distance between each one and their common ancestor c more however they show roughly the same degree of relatedness the sequence divergence between m and n is about  whereas that between p and s is about  m and n diverged  million years ago whereas p and s diverged  million years ago d it is more informative to compare species that are separated by a greater evolutionary distance comparing m and q which diverged  million years ago will therefore be better able to identify sequences likely to be important for function closely related species share many sequences by chance because insufficient time has passed for neutral mutations to accumulate  the simplest way to evolve the new gene is by duplication and divergence if the gene is duplicated then the cell or lineage can maintain one functional intact copy of the original gene and can thus tolerate a disabling mutation in the second copy the second copy can initially be modified by the x or y mutation that impairs its function at some later time many generations later the gene with the single mutation can acquire the additional mutation to yield the doubly mutant xy gene with the new or improved function chapter  dna replication repair and recombination questions  the mutation rate is about  mutation per  nucleotides per cell division in most organisms from e coli bacteria through nematode worms up to humans you aspire to develop an improved superorganism with a reduced mutation rate through a clever genetic screen you isolate a mutant strain of e coli that suffers only about  mutation per  nucleotides per cell division you imagine that this superorganism will have superior survival and proliferation properties and might take over the world a colleague suggests you do the following experiment put a gene encoding yellow fluorescent protein yfp in the original strain and a gene encoding cyan fluorescent protein cfp in the mutant strain start with a single cell from each strain and allow those cells to proliferate under optimal conditions for a month then mix equal numbers of cells from each strain together so that  of the cells are yellow and  are cyan and split the mixture into two parts culture “mix ” in rich growth medium for four weeks diluting the cells and adding fresh medium every two days culture “mix ” in a similar way except add excess salt during the first week add copper during the second week grow at an elevated temperature during the third week and reduce the nutrients in the medium during the fourth week finally examine the ratio of yellow to cyan cells in the mixes you find that  of the cells in mix  are cyan but only  of the cells in mix  are cyan explain these observations suggest a reason why the mutation rate is  in all wildtype organisms tested  a pregnant mouse is exposed to high levels of a chemical many of the mice in her litter are deformed but when they are interbred with each other all their offspring are normal for each of the statements below explain why it is a likely or an unlikely explanation of the observations a the mother mouse’s germ cells were mutated b in the deformed mice germ cells but not somatic cells were mutated c the toxic chemical affects development but is not mutagenic d in the deformed mice somatic cells but not germ cells were mutated  imagine that you join a laboratory that has established a technique for examining dna replication in a cellular extract to the cellular protein extract you simply add nucleotides a small amount of radiolabeled pdgtp to aid visualization of the synthesized dna and a basepair linear doublestranded dna molecule that contains an origin of replication in the middle after allowing the reaction to proceed for  minutes at °c you boil the mixture to denature the proteins and the dna strands separate the components on an acrylamide gel and detect the radiolabeled dna products this complete reaction is shown in lane  on the gel in figure q a you perform the assay by yourself for the first time late on a friday night and no one else is in lab the tube labeled “nucleotide mixture” has only enough for a single reaction but you find a tube with a label that reads “datp dttp dgtp dctp” and you use this in a second reaction you find the first reaction looks like lane  and the second reaction looks like lane  why was no dna synthesized in the second reaction b your lab partner has recently isolated several mutant strains that can replicate their dna and proliferate normally at °c but exhibit no dna replication when grown at °c he calls these mutants tsr through tsr for temperature sensitive replication the wildtype strain replicates efficiently at both temperatures you believe that you can use the biochemical assay of cell extracts to identify which genes are defective in the new mutants first you grow wildtype cells and tsr cells at °c make the extracts incubate the dna replication reaction at °c and detect the products on a gel you observe the pattern shown in lanes  and  you are so excited by the results you run to your lab partner and tell him that you know what enzyme is defective he is delighted by your results but says that there are two different enzymes that can account for your results what are they c heartened by your initial success in narrowing down the identity of the defective genes in the new mutants you test the mutants called tsr tsr and tsr you find they all give the pattern shown in lane  they fail to make detectable dna products name two of the several proteins that when defective might yield the pattern in lane  d to explore these mutants further you mix the extracts together you find that tsr plus tsr gives a wildtype pattern shown in lane  but tsr plus tsr still gives the mutant pattern in lane  what is the simplest explanation for these results figure q  stranddirected mismatch repair occurs soon after the passage of a replication fork to repair mismatched base pairs and preferentially restore the original sequence how does the repair system know which is the original sequence and which is the new mutated sequence to identify the newly synthesized strand procaryotes take advantage of the transient absence of methylation eucaryotes cannot use hemimethylation as a clue and instead use singlestranded dna nicks to identify the newly synthesized strand consider a  kb stretch of doublestranded dna before replication with its “top” strand and “bottom” strand to convince yourself that replication generates a new “bottom” strand and a new “top” strand that both contain nicks transiently draw a replication bubble that started in the middle of the dna and extends almost to the edge show the origin of replication the replication forks the leading and lagging strands and the ’ and ’ ends of all dna fragments  yeast cells that are heterozygous for the ade gene are useful for following the distribution of alleles after meiosis the meiotic products in yeast are called spores and are analogous to sperm and eggs all four spores derived from meiosis in a single cell are packaged together as a tetrad and they can be separated under the microscope and deposited at specific locations on an agar pad when the agar pad is placed on appropriate medium in a petri dish a colony of cells grows from each spore colonies that have wildtype ade are white and those that have mutant ade are red most tetrads give two white and two red colonies as would be expected from simple mendelian genetics a sometimes a tetrad yields three white and one red spore colony or vice versa what is the name for the phenomenon that causes this pattern and how does it arise b when certain yeast mutants are sent through meiosis a few of the spore colonies exhibit sectoring a sectored colony has about half red cells and half white cells consider all of the enzymatic steps in homologous recombination what part of homologous recombination is defective in these “pms” for postmeiotic segregation mutants c mutations in human homologs of the yeast pms genes contribute to the development of some cancers as a result of their effects on mitotic dna replication why do you think this is  chromosomal dna sequences are maintained and replicated with such high fidelity that the sequence of the human genome is changed by only about three nucleotides each time a cell divides you mention this astonishing fact to your grandfather who has just read an article in the newspaper about human genetics he exclaims that this seems to be a very high mutation rate because changing the function of three proteins every time a cell divides should quickly lead to a defective individual explain the mistake in your grandfather’s reasoning  the bacterium e coli replicates its genome in about  minutes under ideal growth conditions surprisingly the fruit fly drosophila can replicate its genome in only  minutes how can this be for each statement below indicate whether it is true and whether it can explain the difference in the duration of replication a the drosophila genome is smaller than the e coli genome b eucaryotic dna polymerase synthesizes dna at a much faster rate than procaryotic dna polymerase c the nuclear membrane keeps the drosophila dna concentrated in one place in the cell d drosophila dna contains more origins of replication than e coli dna e eucaryotes have more than one kind of dna polymerase  some retrotransposons and retroviruses integrate preferentially into regions of the chromosome that are a packaged in euchromatin and b located outside the regions of genes that encode the amino acid sequences of proteins why might these mobile genetic elements have evolved this strategy chapter  how cells read the genome from dna to protein questions  consider an rna molecule that forms part of an rnp on the basis of an alignment of the nucleotide sequence of this rna from several species and a computer algorithm that predicts secondary structure in rna molecules you hypothesize that the rna folds and forms conventional basepair interactions as shown in figure q to test this structural hypothesis you make many mutated forms of the rna that contain one or two base changes you test to see whether each mutant rna is functional or defective for example your results lead you to conclude that the g indicated by the arrow pairs with the c as shown describe a set of three mutants and explain the phenotypes that would support your conclusion figure q  cells have several mechanisms to prevent the production and accumulation of truncated protein fragments to illustrate why these fragments can be deleterious consider a transcriptional activator protein called groovy that binds to an enhancer element upstream of the zippy gene groovy has a dnabinding domain at its nterminus and a domain that binds a histonemodifying enzyme at its cterminus a if a cell makes substantial amounts of an nterminal fragment of groovy containing the dnabinding domain what is likely to happen to transcription of the zippy gene b if in addition to the nterminal fragment of groovy a cell also makes an equal amount of the fulllength protein what is likely to happen to transcription of the zippy gene c consider two cell lines or strains that each have a fully functional allele of the groovy gene on one copy of chromosome  on the second copy of chromosome  strain  lacks a second groovy allele whereas strain  contains the groovy allele that codes for the nterminal fragment described in part a if strain  and strain  have different amounts of zippy mrna which do you expect to have more zippy mrna explain d strain  encodes the same nterminal groovy fragment as strain  except that the gene in strain  contains a deletion of some groovy coding sequence and strain  has a single basepair change that converts a lysine codon aaa to a stop codon uaa you find that strain  produces the same amount of zippy mrna as strain  can you explain why  more than  of mammalian genes encode proteins and fewer than  produce rna as their final product a your friend says this means that most rna in cells is mrna not rrna do you agree explain b you want to separate the mrna from other rna molecules taking advantage of the ability of rna to hybridize to a complementary dna strand describe a strategy to purify mrna from other rnas  consider a premrna that is  nucleotides long and contains seven base exons separated by base introns it seems like an overwhelming task for the splicing machinery to find the exons buried in the intron sequences and to splice them properly without skipping any exons explain how this is accomplished  alignment of the nucleotide sequences of orthologous genes from different organisms can suggest which amino acids are important for the function of a protein consider the alignment of cdna sequences shown in figure qa taken from the middle of a gene that has been highly conserved during evolution can you deduce the reading frame of this segment of cdna you can consult the genetic code provided in figure qb figure q  you measure the stability of your favorite protein kinase and find that half of the protein is degraded every  minutes you suspect that your protein is subjected to ubiquitinmediated proteolysis so you partly purify the protein run a gel transfer to a membrane and probe with an antibody against ubiquitin you do not detect any ubiquitin attached to your protein even though control experiments demonstrate that your protein is present on the membrane and the antiubiquitin antibody successfully detects another ubiquitylated protein a does this mean that your protein is not ubiquitylated explain b your advisor suggests that you perform additional experiments to block ubiquitinmediated degradation and then see whether your protein is ubiquitylated under these conditions describe one way to accomplish this task  for quality control in protein translation there are two time delays in the correct positioning of incoming charged trnas on the ribosome the first is a delay in the hydrolysis of gtp by eftu after it brings a charged trna to the ribosome the second is a delay before the amino acid carried by the trna moves into position at the active site of the ribosome both of these delays are longer for an incorrect trna than for a correct one but what if one of these delays were the same length of time for correct and incorrect trnas consider whether a fixed delay can still increase accuracy a assume that the affinity of binding between the mrna–ribosome complex and the trnas in question are described by kd values of  m and  m which kd is for the correct trna b recall that kd  koffkon in general kon values do not change as much as koff values assume that kon is  m– sec– for both correct and incorrect trna binding to the mrna–ribosome complex calculate the koff for the correct and incorrect trnas what do you expect will happen during a delay of  second  you want to purify large amounts of a human tumor suppressor protein called tusup for biochemical studies the easiest and cheapest way to achieve this is to place the tusup gene in an expression plasmid in the bacteria e coli a unfortunately you find that the bacteria produce only a small amount of tusup even worse they produce far more nterminal fragments than fulllength tusup proteins your advisor notes that your protein has many arginine codons and this may cause a problem you peruse the literature on codon usage in bacterial and human genes and discover that human genes have a bias for the various arginine codons that differs from that of e coli genes as shown in table q why might this different codon usage limit the production of fulllength tusup protein how might you remedy the problem b the remedy you proposed in a worked wonderfully so the bacteria express large amounts of fulllength tusup protein however you find that the protein is insoluble because it is misfolded and aggregated inside the bacterial cells what proteins could you overexpress in e coli to help the overexpressed tusup proteins fold and to prevent their aggregation table q chapter  control of gene expression questions  figure q shows a dna double helix and its nucleotide sequence a indicate the major groove and the minor groove b a homodimeric helix–turn–helix protein binds to a dna fragment containing this sequence its preferred halfsite is aacac show where the two recognition helices in the protein contact the dna c are protein–dna contacts primarily in the major or the minor groove of dna what parts of the nucleotides contact the amino acid side chains of the protein to provide most sequence specificity what kind of bond is primarily responsible for specific protein–dna interactions d if  base pairs are inserted in the middle of a binding site for a dimeric helix–turn–helix protein binding is abolished if  base pairs are inserted binding is sometimes preserved albeit with lowered affinity explain these observations figure q  figure q shows an alignment of dna sequences upstream of the same gene from five closely related yeasts identical nucleotides are highlighted in gray a draw boxes around dna sequences where transcriptional activators or repressors probably bind for each site indicate whether the dnabinding protein is likely to be a monomer a homodimer or a heterodimer b you suspect you know which dnabinding protein recognizes the first site in the sequence shown describe an experiment to determine whether your hunch is correct figure q  the sweetie gene is not expressed during normal growth conditions but is expressed after treatment of cells with sucrose in principle the gene could be turned on by production or activation of a transcriptional activator positive control or by inactivation or depletion of a transcriptional repressor negative control one way to distinguish between these alternatives is to isolate and characterize mutants in which sweetie is expressed in the absence of sucrose three possible mutants are described below explain whether each mutant supports positive or negative control a a single basepair change located  base pairs upstream ’ of the sweetie coding region b a mutation in a coding region distinct from sweetie that when present in both copies of the chromosome in a diploid cell causes expression of sweetie in the absence of sucrose however when a diploid cell has the mutant gene on one chromosome and a normal copy on the other chromosome sweetie is expressed normally this is a recessive mutation c a mutation in a coding region distinct from sweetie that causes expression of sweetie in the absence of sucrose even when a diploid cell has one normal copy of the gene and one mutant copy this is a dominant mutation  protein–protein interactions for four hypothetical regulatory proteins are shown in a table below each protein binds a specific dna sequence and regulates gene expression fill in the table noting whether each regulator is likely to be an activator or a repressor and suggesting the main mechanism by which it controls gene expression table of gene expression regulators table q  several mechanisms enable heritable cellular memory in which patterns of gene regulation in a single cell are passed on to progeny cells list three such mechanisms briefly describe how each works and provide a biological instance in which each is important  figure q illustrates the positive and negative interactions in a complex gene regulatory circuit a does this circuit include examples of positive feedback negative feedback or feedforward if so label and draw a box around the relevant subcircuit briefly describe the components involved and the effect of the subcircuit on the levels of activated components for example there is positive feedback from c to a thereby allowing a to activate itself indirectly b is x a positive or negative regulator of z figure q  is the following statement true or false explain your answer “the number of genes in an organism is a good indicator of the number of different proteins found in a single cell from that organism”  the foofoo gene normally causes one breed of rabbits to have dark brown fur when foofoo function is abolished the rabbits are white if you replace the ¢ utr of foofoo with the ¢utr from another gene the resulting rabbits are light brown describe three mechanisms that might cause this outcome chapter  manipulating proteins dna and rna questions  you have accidentally torn the labels off two tubes each containing a different plasmid and now do not know which plasmid is in which tube fortunately you have restriction maps for both plasmids shown in figure q you have the opportunity to test just one sample from one of your tubes you have equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis a standard set of dna size markers and the necessary restriction enzymes a outline briefly the series of steps you would perform to determine which plasmid is in which tube b which restriction enzyme or combination of restriction enzymes would you use in this experiment figure q  you have sequenced a short piece of dna and produced the gel shown below a what is the sequence of the dna starting from the ¢ end b if you know that this sequence is from the middle of a proteincoding cdna clone what amino acid sequence can you deduce from this sequence figure q  figure q shows the recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes sali xhoi psti and smai and a plasmid with the sites of cleavage for these enzymes marked a consider all possible digestion reactions with one or two restriction enzymes after which of the digestions can the plasmid form into a circle again simply by treatment with dna ligase assume that after digestion any small pieces of dna are removed and it is only the larger portion of plasmid that you are trying to restore to its circular state b after which of the possible digestions can the plasmid be restored to a circle by first adding dna polymerase and the four deoxynucleotides then treating with dna ligase again assume that you are trying to form the larger portion of plasmid into a circle again figure q  you have an oligonucleotide probe that hybridizes to part of gene a from a eucaryotic cell you can use this probe to isolate a corresponding plasmid from a dna library harbored by a collection of bacteria will a cdna library or a genomic dna library be more appropriate for the following applications explain a you want to study the promoter of a gene a b gene a encodes a trna and you wish to isolate a piece of dna containing the fulllength sequence of the trna c you discover that gene a is alternatively spliced and you want to see which predicted alternative splice products are actually produced in a cell d you want to find both gene a and the genes located near gene a on the chromosome e you want to express gene a in bacteria to produce lots of protein a f you want to perform a phylogenetic comparison to find amino acid sequences important for the function of gene a  you want to make an antibody against a c elegans nematode protein that the dna shown in figure qa encodes to do this you will clone the coding sequence into a bacterial expression plasmid overexpress the protein purify it and inject it into a mouse to stimulate the production of antibodies against the protein a you use polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification to amplify the dna corresponding to the  base pairs of coding sequence this coding sequence lies between the two flanking sequence shown in figure qa you will then insert the pcr product into the bamhi site of the expression plasmid shown in figure qb is it best to use genomic dna or cdna as template in the pcr reaction what are the sequences of the two oligonucleotide primers that will allow you to amplify the dna by pcr and insert it into the bamhi site remember to indicate the ¢ and ¢ ends of the primers b briefly describe the series of enzymatic treatments you will use to create the expression plasmid before transferring it into bacterial cells c once the correct new expression plasmid is in bacterial cells you induce high levels of expression of your nematode protein briefly describe the series of steps you will perform to go from the cells containing high levels of protein to partly purified protein d several weeks after you inject a mouse with your purified protein you sample its blood serum which contains antibodies you know from in situ hybridizations that the mrna corresponding to your protein is found in gonad cells but not in gut cells to test whether the mouse has made antibodies against your protein you isolate protein from gonad cells and from gut cells and perform a western blot also known as an immunoblot with the mouse serum and a fluorescent second antibody that binds mouse antibodies your result is shown in figure qc did the mouse make antibodies against your protein does the serum specifically recognize only one nematode protein illustrate your written answers by labeling the blot what might you do next if you wanted to use antibodies from this mouse to determine the subcellular location of your protein in fixed cells figure q  current technologies allow much more facile manipulation and analysis of nucleic acids than proteins for example it is straightforward to generate and purify thousands of different dna molecules for a dna microarray but difficult to make an analogous protein microarray this may reflect fundamental differences between the two kinds of polymers colloquially we might say that dna double helices are all the same but each protein has its own personality a compare how the shape of a dna double helix or protein molecule depends on the sequence of monomers b compare the means used to detect a specific dna molecule in a complex mixture of other dnas with that used to detect a specific protein in a complex protein mixture c briefly compare the means used to make many copies of a dna or protein molecule for biochemical experiments d can you unambiguously predict an amino acid sequence from a cdna sequence can you unambiguously predict a cdna sequence from an amino acid sequence explain  you are working in a laboratory trying to identify how the nematode worm c elegans senses and moves toward specific “attractant” chemicals you examine an electronic database that compiles mrna expression profiles of all nematode genes measured by dna microarray hybridization experiments and find that an unknown gene is transcribed coordinately with several genes known to be involved in the attractant response you name this gene unk and set out to learn what it does a without doing a single experiment at the lab bench how can you learn more about what the unk protein might be doing how might this influence your choice of experiments with unk b you decide to use reverse genetics to learn more about the function of the unk gene what is the simplest first experiment to do considering that you are working with nematodes c you decide to look for proteins that bind to unk which may provide important clues to its function briefly describe an approach to find binding partners d you decide to determine where and when unk is expressed within the animal to learn more about how it causes the observed phenotypes describe an approach to monitor spatiotemporal dynamics of unk expression  human babies use the lactase enzyme to metabolize the milk sugar lactose most human adults are lactoseintolerant because this gene is normally turned off in adults however many adults of european descent still express lactase this lactasepersistence trait is tightly linked to a snp called ct located near the lactase gene examination of many snps flanking the lactase gene provided evidence that lactase persistence has been subject to very strong positive selective pressure and became prevalent relatively recently about  years ago which is roughly coincident with the time that dairy farming arose in northern europe a much of the supporting genomic evidence comes from the sizes of haplotype blocks are the haplotype blocks surrounding the lactase gene in lactasepersistent individuals bigger or smaller than the average blocks found throughout the genome or of average size are the corresponding haplotype blocks in lactoseintolerant individuals bigger smaller or average b does the ct snp cause the lactasepersistence trait c name an experimental technique that can determine if an unknown adult is lactoseintolerant or lactasepersistent d is lactase persistence likely to be a dominant trait or a recessive trait chapter  visualizing cells questions  your friend has joined a lab that has a light microscope connected to a computer imaging system a inch monitor is attached to the computer your friend claims that because he can now enlarge all images obtained using the light microscope on the large monitor that he will be able to use the light microscope to resolve objects that are separated by less than  µm is he right  your friend sue has joined a lab on campus that uses green fluorescent protein gfp as a tool to localize globular proteins to specific compartments in the cell sue creates a fusion protein by fusing gfp to her protein of interest examines the fusion protein’s localization in the cell and finds that it is localized to the plasma membrane however your friend bob points out that the theoretical limit of resolution for a light microscope is just under  µm and most globular proteins are in the  nm  µm size range and that lipid bilayers are about  nm  µm thick given that what bob says is true explain why sue can see her globular protein localized at the plasma membrane  figure q shows the path of light through a compound microscope to your eye if you were to insert a magnifying lens between the light source and the condenser would you increase the magnification of the image explain figure q  differential interference contrast dic microscopy uses the phase differences that occur as light passes through a cell to generate an image that looks somewhat threedimensional the micrographs in figure q demonstrate the difference between a brightfield image on top and one imaged using dic on bottom figure q do the threedimensional images obtained using dic represent the actual geometry of the cell explain your answer  figure q illustrates the optical system of a fluorescence microscope figure q your friend has discovered a new fluorescent protein that has a peak absorption at  nm and a peak emission at  nm she has found eight filters and installed them on a microscope down the hall to create four filter sets on it with the following properties set a filter  passes wavelengths between  and  nm filter  passes wavelengths between  and  nm set b filter  passes all wavelengths above  nm filter  passes wavelengths between  and  nm set c filter  passes wavelengths between  and  nm filter  passes wavelengths between  and  nm set d filter  passes all wavelengths above  nm filter  passes all wavelengths above  nm would any of these filter sets be appropriate for your friend’s new fluorescent protein and if so which one explain your answer  a confocal microscope is similar to an epifluorescence microscope except that a laser is the light source and two pinholes labeled a and b on figure q are used figure q unfortunately somebody has stolen the confocal pinhole that lies between the dichroic mirror and the detector you decide to do go ahead and use the microscope despite the theft how will the missing pinhole affect your imaging  you are interested in studying the function of two proteins that you believe are important for cell signaling called siga and sigb both siga and sigb are found in the nucleus and are  identical at the amino acid level you are excited about the frap fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique you have learned about in class thus you create a cell line that contains siga fused to green fluorescent protein gfp and a separate cell line strain that contains sigb fused to gfp and use these cell lines to perform frap experiments the results you obtain are diagrammed in figure q the grey color represents the gfp signal figure q from these results is siga or sigb more likely to be imported into the nucleus more quickly explain  the subcellular localization of a specific protein can be determined by electron microscopy if an antibody that recognizes a specific protein is coupled to a gold particle and this antibody is applied to the sample explain why the use of a gold particle is preferable to an aluminum particle chapter  questions  you are interested in studying the composition of lipid bilayers and how they are maintained you discover two uncharacterized phospholipids which you call plx and plz you decide to characterize the behavior of plx and plz by labeling the head group of each phospholipid this label is stable when the lipid resides in the membrane’s outer leaflet but unstable when the lipid resides in the membrane’s inner leaflet you incorporate labeled versions of plx and plz into either the inside or the outside of the cell and monitor the change in signal intensity of these lipids in the plasma membrane your data are presented in the graphs in figure q figure q a where in the plasma membrane are plx and plz normally located b are there flippases in the cell for either of these phospholipids why  you are interested in studying lipid rafts you have devised a method to create an artificial lipid bilayer that contains small patches of lipids that are straighter and longer than those found in the rest of the bilayer how would you expect the fluidity of these small patches to compare with the rest of the lipid bilayer explain  it is thought that excess lipids in the cell are packaged into lipid droplets in the endoplasmic reticulum explain why lipid droplets are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and not a phospholipid bilayer like other vesicles that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum  your friend has isolated plasma membranes and reassembled the membranes into small vesicles using fluorescently labeled lectin he sees that some of his vesicles are fluorescently labeled and some are not recall that lectin binds to carbohydrates furthermore his labeled lectin cannot permeate membranes a which population of vesicles has a surface similar to that of the cell why b how do you explain the other population of vesicles  your friend is working on a protein that he calls p because of its molecular mass he knows that p is a transmembrane protein with three membranespanning domains it has been previously reported that p interacts with three proteins called p p and p again on the basis of their apparent sizes on an sds polyacrylamide gel these four proteins are thought to exist as a protein complex in the cell to determine how these proteins interact with the membrane you perform a set of experiments in which you first lyse the cells and save some of your lysate which you run in the input lane labeled “i” in figure q the lysate is then subjected to a lowspeed centrifugation so that you separate out the membrane fraction which ends up in the pellet “p” from the cytoplasm which is in the supernatant “s” you then wash the pellet from the first extraction with a highsalt wash that does not disrupt the lipid bilayer and save a little bit to run on the gel after the highsalt wash you centrifuge the pellet again your results are illustrated on the gel in figure q from these data explain the nature of the association of these proteins with cellular membranes figure q  examine the two hydropathy plots in figure q figure q a which is a plot of a protein that contains helices that cross the membrane b for the protein containing a transmembrane domain how many transmembrane domains would you predict there are why c the plots in figure q were created with a “window size” of  in creating a hydropathy plot a value is assigned to an amino acid based on how hydrophobic it is deemed to be the window size determines the number of amino acids over which a hydrophobicity value is averaged once a hydrophobicity value is calculated for a particular window a hydrophobicity value is then calculated starting at the next amino acid for the next window explain why a “window size” of  is more useful for calculating a hydrophobicity plot for examining transmembrane proteins as opposed to a smaller “window size” such as   is the following sentence true or false explain peptide bonds are polar and thus must be covalently modified before proteins can be inserted into the membrane  your friend is examining the mobility of transmembrane proteins using frap a explain what frap stands for and how it is performed b figure qa and b depicts two typical graphs your friend has obtained from her frap studies which of these graphs would best represent the following types of proteins explain your reasoning  a transmembrane protein that is tethered to the extracellular matrix  a transmembrane protein that is highly mobile in the membrane c your friend has also obtained a third graph from her experiments shown in figure qc explain how you might get a reading such as this from a frap experiment examining transmembrane proteins figure q small diffusion coefficient chapter  membrane transport of small molecules and the electrical properties of membranes questions  is the following statement true or false explain your answer o is bigger than mg and thus will diffuse more slowly across a lipid bilayer  you have isolated a bacterial transporter that transports mg and ca in opposite directions you produce lipid vesicles that contain this mg–ca pump as the sole membrane protein the mg–ca pumps are oriented such that mg is pumped into the vesicle while ca is pumped out each pump transports one mg ion into the vesicle and one ca ion out of the vesicle during each pumping cycle and atp hydrolysis powers this transport as illustrated in figure q figure q a predict what would happen if the solution inside the vesicles contained  mm mg and  mm ca ions while the solution outside the vesicles contained  mm mg and  mm ca ions as well as  mm atp and you had a  fold excess of fluid outside the vesicles compared with the volume inside the vesicles specifically be sure to state whether you think there would be net movement of ions and if so how the concentrations of the mg and ca ions inside and outside the bilayer would change in addition be sure to state whether you would be creating an electrical gradient a chemical gradient or both b explain how long the pump will run  your friend works for a biotech company where they have come up with a top secret drug they hope will cure a hereditary kidney disease he refuses to tell you anything about this drug except to give you a peek at their data see figure q regarding the kinetics of uptake of this drug into kidney cells he thinks his data support the idea that a protein is required for the uptake of his drug his supervisor thinks his data show that this drug simply diffuses into the cell from what you have learned in cell biology who is right your friend or his supervisor explain your answer figure q  to determine the crystal structure of bacterial lactose permease a mutation that changed cysteine  to glycine was engineered this mutation locked the protein into a particular conformation so that the transporter was inwardfacing such that its sugarbinding domain faced the cytoplasmic portion of the cell explain why using this cg mutant made it more feasible to determine the structure of lactose permease  your friend works in a lab that is interested in the properties of an amino acid transporter called tspz the lab has recently isolated two compounds that bind directly to and act as inhibitors of tspz these inhibitors have been named inh and inh both inh and inh seem to reduce amino acid transport fold when added to cells individually to characterize how inh works your friend has discovered that inh does not affect the ability of tspz to bind amino acid but instead seems to decrease the rate at which tspz is able to change its conformation another graduate student in the lab has been working on how inh affects tspz and has determined that inh acts in a manner consistent with its being a competitive inhibitor of tspz given this information would you predict that adding inh and inh together to cells would have a greater effect a smaller effect or no effect on tspz transport compared with the addition of only one of these inhibitors onto cells explain  recall that the nernst equation is  for univalent ions at °c the equation reduces to  a given the knowledge that if x   then logx is a positive number if x   then logx is negative and given the intracellular and extracellular concentrations for the ions listed in table q for the neuron in question indicate whether the equilibrium potential is positive or negative for the k and na ions in this particular cell table q b if you were to add a drug that causes the chloride channels on this neuron to open would this make it easier harder or not affect the cell’s ability to fire an action potential explain your answer  you are interested in understanding how the neuromuscular junction works the normal voltagegated na channel has the characteristics depicted by the solid line in figure q you decide to replace this channel with a mutant voltagegated na channel with the characteristics depicted by the dotted line do you predict that the cell containing the mutant na channel will require more less or the same amount or acetylcholine to be released from the nerve terminal to stimulate muscle contraction explain your answer figure q  a neuron can receive inputs from many different presynaptic cells and needs to integrate information about the excitatory postsynaptic potentials psps and inhibitory psps it is receiving different types of k channels are required to ensure that the frequency of action potentials reflects the magnitude of the combined psps if a normal cell produces a pattern of membrane depolarization following the combined psps illustrated in figure q how would a drug that reduces the activity of the delayed k channels alter the pattern of membrane depolarization explain figure q chapter  intracellular compartments and protein sorting questions  you are studying a protein that normally resides in the plasma membrane the organization of this protein is depicted in figure q where the gray boxes labeled a b and c represent transmembrane regions and the segments labeled    and  represent the portions of the protein between the transmembrane regions figure q if you also know that segments  and  contain nlinked oligosaccharides draw the topology of the protein as it is inserted in the plasma membrane be sure to label the cytoplasmic and extracellular face of your membrane and the nterminus and cterminus of your protein  if you replace the normal ran protein in the cell with a ran protein that has an amino acid change locking ran in a gdpbound state how will this affect nuclear import and export  your friend is interested in targeting green fluorescent protein gfp to the er he decides to create a modified version of gfp that he calls gfper by adding the er retention signal as described in table  of the textbook lysaspgluleu to the cterminus of gfp he sees that gfper is expressed in cells and that gfper is four amino acids longer than the unmodified gfp however to his surprise even though gfper contains an er retention signal it is in the cytoplasm of the cell just like the unmodified gfp he comes to you for help in fixing this problem what do you suggest he should do  the graduate student from the lab next door comes to you in a panic she had received three different yeast strains from a lab in japan and in the process of transferring these strains to plates she mixed them up she knows that she received three strains a one defective in the sam complex b one defective in both the tom complex and the tim complex and c one defective in the signal peptidase that exists in the mitochondrial matrix fortunately you have antibodies against cox a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase cox normally resides in the mitochondrial matrix and is encoded by a nuclear gene you conduct some experiments in which you fractionate wildtype cells and the three unknown strains and then for each strain subject the cytoplasmic fraction and the mitochondrial fraction to electrophoresis on an sds gel your results are depicted in figure q in which c indicates the cytoplasmic fraction and m the mitochondrial fraction figure q from these results identify which strain contains which mutation and explain your answers  your friend shows you her data she has been analyzing a protein to determine which parts of the protein are responsible for its localization she has created various deletion mutations in her protein and examined its localization under normal conditions and also in the presence of leptomycin b an inhibitor of the nuclear export machinery her data are depicted in figure q figure q from her data answer the following questions a where do you think the nuclear localization signal nls is located explain b where do you think the nuclear export signal nes is located explain  your friend sends you two tubes of protein one tube contains a protein crg that contains a nuclear export signal the other tube contains the nuclear export receptor xpo for crg you are excited to have received these proteins because you are interested in the biochemistry of nuclear export you try to get crg to bind xpo but do not succeed you complain to your lab partner about how your friend sent you bad reagents however your lab partner has just taken a cell biology class and gently reminds you to try one more experiment before you call your friend what does your labmate suggest  the thylakoid space in chloroplasts contains proteins important for photosynthesis your friend is interested in understanding how proteins get to the thylakoid space and is examining the import of the pc protein a protein that is encoded by the nucleus and normally resides in the thylakoid space of the chloroplast he has defined a  amino acid sequence at the nterminus of the pc protein that is necessary and sufficient for import into the chloroplast this  amino acid sequence can direct the import of gfp into the chloroplast and the deletion of these  amino acids on pc makes the pc protein localize to the cytoplasm furthermore all  amino acids seem to be required because tests using fewer than the  amino acids do not show these properties excited about these results your friend takes the intact pc protein and changes residues – by replacing the each of the original amino acids with the amino acid alanine and calls this mutation pcala he decides to express pcala in cells expecting it to be cytoplasmic to his surprise this protein still goes to the chloroplast but it does not enter the thylakoid space from your understanding of transport to the thylakoid space suggest a hypothesis to explain why your friend’s mutants specifically disrupt this transport  state whether the following proteins are being translated on ribosomes attached to the er and explain your answer a a protein that resides in the chloroplast b a protein that resides in an endosome c a protein that will be secreted into the extracellular space d a nuclear protein e a protein linked to the plasma membrane by a gpi anchor f a protein that resides between the inner and outer nuclear membranes chapter  intracellular vesicular traffic questions  you have a protein that has two transmembrane domains the spacing of the transmembrane domains is shown as gray boxes in figure q the cterminal domain of this protein is cytoplasmic figure q a is the nterminal domain of the protein cytoplasmic or extracellular why b draw the topology of this protein in a transport vesicle as it transits from the golgi to the plasma membrane c your friend discovers that this protein is glycosylated which portion of this protein is most likely to be glycosylated explain  your friend is studying a secreted protein called inp inp is produced as a precursor form called proinp the maturation of inp requires that a short nterminal segment be cleaved your friend has raised two sets of antibodies that he calls pro and cinp pro antibodies specifically bind to the peptide removed by cleavage during maturation cinp antibodies were raised using the cterminal half of inp as the antigen your friend wanted to use these antibodies to determine where within the secretory pathway propeptide cleavage occurs he collected three different cellular fractions that contain er cis golgi and trans golgi he was about to assay these fractions with his pro antibody and his inp antibody when he realized that the labels had come off his cellular fractions in the freezer he comes to you for sympathy but you tell him to stop whining run the fractions and also probe the fractions with anticopii and anticlathrin antibodies you have in your lab he comes to you with his results which are summarized in table q table q from these results can you determine in which compartment inp is likely to be processed into the mature form explain  two graduate students down the hall mary and jenny are having an argument mary has purified a novel protein she is calling ecm mary hypothesizes that ecm is an extracellular matrix protein because it seems to be soluble and is glycosylated jenny has tested the protein and found it to be nglycosylated with a mannose phosphate added to the nlinked oligosaccharide jenny claims that her findings should convince mary that ecm is unlikely to be an extracellular matrix protein whom do you agree with and why  your friend is studying a protein of  amino acids localized to secretory vesicles she wants to define the regions of the protein responsible for its localization to this particular class of vesicles she creates a series of deletion constructs in which she deletes different amino acid segments from the protein she expresses each of her proteins in cells and monitors the proteins’ localizations within the cell obtaining the data depicted in figure q figure q a from these data where do you predict the localization sequence is for this protein b if your friend made a protein that lacked only those sequences you defined in part a and if she expressed this protein in cells where would you predict that it would end up explain  the lab you work in studies a protein called per that you believe normally resides in the er and is involved in detecting misfolded proteins in the er you have made an antibody that recognizes the per protein and perform some electron microscopy studies in collaboration with a new postdoc who is highly trained in this technique the new postdoc comes to you in a panic with his latest results not only does he see per localizing to the er he also sees per in some transport vesicles and some weak golgi staining your adviser overhears this conversation and tells him not to worry and that he should check to see whether those transport vesicles will react with an antibody against copi that you have in the lab explain what you think your adviser was thinking about when she suggested this experiment  your friend has just joined a lab studying a phospholipase that normally resides in the lysosome you have recently developed an assay to study the activity of cytoplasmic phospholipase c in vitro because your friend would like to develop an in vitro assay for his phospholipase he asks you for the protocol you use for your assay he is particularly interested in the buffers you use why you should advise your friend not to use your protocol  your friend is trying to create an in vitro system for studying the formation of copii vesicles he finds that to get efficient vesicle budding from artificial membranes he needs to add the coat proteins the sar gtpbinding protein the gtpaseactivating protein gap for sar and gmppnp a nonhydrolyzable analog of gtp to synthetic membranes his experiment will not work in the presence of gtp explain why your friend needs to add gmppmp instead of gtp  your friend comes to you confused she has been working on a protein that she thinks is rapidly degraded when cells are given serum she has been assaying this degradation by using western blot analysis furthermore she has also seen that her protein is ubiquitylated because antibodies that recognize ubiquitin will recognize her protein after serum treatment she expected to isolate her protein from a cytoplasmic fraction because the proteosome is in the cytoplasm but when she fractionated cells she found that her protein was found in a membrane fraction in which cellular compartment do you think your friend’s protein is located explain chapter  energy conversion mitochondria and chloroplasts questions  you want to study the biochemical properties of the respiratory enzyme complexes required for oxidative phosphorylation your initial goal is to measure proton pumping by the nadh dehydrogenase complex you mix purified nadh dehydrogenase complex with phospholipids and a ph indicator dye that changes color at acidic ph and you follow a protocol for making liposomes after verifying that the protein complex was incorporated into liposomes you add nadh and incubate at °c you are dismayed to observe no color change in the ph indicator dye a one labmate says the result is not surprising because you forgot to add a key component what is this key component explain why it is important b another labmate suggests that the failure to observe a ph change occurred because protein complexes are inserted in the lipid bilayer in both possible orientations do you agree that this might prevent the establishment of a ph gradient in your experiment  consider a redox reaction between molecules a and b molecule a has a redox potential of – mv and molecule b has a redox potential of  mv for the transfer of electrons from a to b is the dg° positive or negative or zero under what conditions will the reverse reaction transfer of electrons from b to a occur  which of the following reactions have a large enough freeenergy change to enable it to be used in principle to provide the energy needed to synthesize one molecule of atp from adp and pi under standard conditions see table q recall that dg°¢  –n ´ f ´ de¢ where f is a constant  and n is the number of electrons transferred and that de¢  e¢ acceptor – e¢ donor for the atp synthesis reaction dg°¢ is – kcalmol which corresponds to dg°¢f   mv a the reduction of a molecule of pyruvate by nadh b the reduction of a molecule of cytochrome b by nadh c the reduction of a molecule of cytochrome b by reduced ubiquinone d the oxidation of a molecule of reduced ubiquinone by cytochrome c e the oxidation of cytochrome c by oxygen table q  consider what will happen to a cell if an h ionophore causes a partial dissipation of the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane reducing the gradient from  mv to  mv a will oxygen consumption increase or decrease will proton pumping increase or decrease explain b will the ratio of atp to adp increase or decrease explain c will the g for the atp synthesis reaction increase or decrease or remain the same explain  both chloroplasts and mitochondria use electron transport chains to convert the energy from highenergy electrons into a form of potential energy an electrochemical gradient across an internal membrane this potential energy is then converted into chemical energy in the form of a highenergy phosphate bond in atp via a socalled protonmotive force the highly favorable thermodynamic release of energy as protons flow down the gradient across this internal membrane in both organelles atp synthase harnesses the energy released by the proton flow to form atp from adp and pi a what is the source of highenergy electrons for chloroplasts what is the source of highenergy electrons for mitochondria b what is the name of the membrane in each organelle in which the electron transport chain and the atp synthase reside c for each organelle what is the name of the space into which the protons are pumped to generate the protonmotive force d the protonmotive force in both organelles is about  mv in both organelles the compartment where atp is synthesized is maintained at ph  the ph difference a measure of the difference in proton concentration between the two sides of the membrane is  in chloroplasts and – in mitochondria why must the ph difference be kept so small in mitochondria given the small ph difference how can the protonmotive force be so high in mitochondria  below is a picture of the z scheme of noncyclic photophosphorylation figure q superimposed on this in gray shading is the reaction loop involved in cyclic photophosphorylation a what chemical reactions do the squiggly vertical lines designate b what products of noncyclic photophosphorylation do the socalled dark reactions require what products of cyclic photophosphorylation do the dark reactions require indicate on the figure where these products are made c why does the chloroplast need cyclic photophosphorylation figure q  you discover a mutant yeast strain that cannot grow when provided with pyruvate as its sole carbohydrate although it grows normally when given glucose as a carbon energy source you call this the pyr– trait wildtype yeast can grow well using either carbon source you designate this the pyr trait you suspect that the mutant yeast have defective mitochondria a why is mitochondrial function critical for growing on pyruvate b you want to determine whether the mutation responsible for the pyr– trait is carried in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome your experiment is to mate pyr– haploid cells to pyr haploid cells and examine segregation of the trait in the progeny after mating the hybrid diploid cells can grow on pyruvate pyr you send these diploid cells through meiosis and examine the four haploid cells generated from a single diploid cell if the mutation is in mitochrondrial dna will the four haploid cells probably be all pyr– all pyr or a combination what if the mutation is in nuclear dna c consider a hereditary human disease that involves mitochondrial dysfunction jane has the disease and she marries joe who does not have the disease they have two sons and two daughters who all have the disease each of the four children grows up marries a spouse without the disease and has a son and a daughter what is the most likely condition diseased or not of jane’s eight grandchildren if the mutation responsible for the disease is in mitochondrial dna what if it is in nuclear dna  consider the following statement “when a chlorophyll molecule within an antenna complex absorbs a photon of sunlight one of its electrons jumps up to a highenergy state this excited electron is then transferred directly to the photochemical reaction center to initiate the electron transport chain” identify and explain the two errors in the second sentence of the statement in your answer refer to the properties of resonance energy transfer chapter  mechanisms of cell communication questions  your friend is trying to understand how the hormone cortisol affects kidney liver and bone cells by examining a set of cell lines derived from kidney cells liver cells and bone cells she gets the following result when she examines her cell lines for expression of the cortisol receptor on a western blot depicted in figure qa unfortunately after she performs this experiment she mixes up her cell lines and is not sure which line comes from which cells she labels the cell lines a b and c and then examines the activity of a cortisolresponsive reporter gene’s expression in the presence and absence of cortisol and collects the data depicted in figure qb figure q a which cell line do you think is the bone cell line explain b provide a possible explanation for why cell line b and cell line c could show differences in their cortisol response  you are interested in the function of a protein mtm that has a ph domain an sh domain and a ptb domain mtm functions downstream of the insulin receptor and binds to this receptor in an insulindependent fashion via its ptb domain you create mutant forms of mtm that delete the various protein domains you find that these mutations do not seem to affect the protein level or folding of mtm you examine the localization of mtm and your results are summarized in table q table q in table q the  symbol indicates that the following protein domain is deleted for example mtmph indicates an mtm protein that lacks the ph domain mtmphsh indicates an mtm protein that lacks both the ph domain and the sh domain given what you know about these three protein domains and the data above explain the role of the ph ptb and sh domains in localizing the mtm protein  you are studying a cell line that responds to a peptide ligand called fge by activating a map kinase pathway in these cells activation of the map kinase pathway ultimately leads to phosphorylation of a transcription factor goh and the transcription of several genes including the suf gene you treat cells with fge and measure suf mrna production and are very excited to see that cells seem to respond to fge in a graded fashion such that an increasing concentration of fge seems to increase suf mrna production as illustrated in figure q figure q you also raise an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of goh using this antibody for immunofluorescence studies you examine the phosphorylation state of goh in cells that have been treated with varying concentrations of fge you see that cells seem to either stain with the antibody or not with no difference in the intensity of staining between the cells that stain furthermore the percentage of cells that stain seems to vary with fge concentration as seen in table q table q are your immunofluorescence results more consistent with the possibility that phosphorylated goh increases progressively in individual cells as the concentration of fge increases or are they more consistent with the possibility that individual cells respond in an allornothing fashion propose an explanation for how cells respond to fge that is consistent with both your observations  you are interested in cell size regulation and discover that signaling through a gpcr is important in controlling cell size in rat white blood cells the g protein downstream of this receptor activates adenylyl cyclase which ultimately leads to the activation of pka you find that cells that lack the gpcr are  smaller than normal cells whereas cells that express a mutant constitutively activated version of pka are  larger than normal cells furthermore the normal blood cells become smaller when treated with cholera toxin which has been shown to inhibit certain subclasses of the subunit of the g protein given these results explain what you predict would happen to the cell’s size bigger smaller or no change if cells were treated in the following fashion a you add pertussis toxin b you inhibit the rgs protein that normally works on the subunit of the g protein involved in this pathway c you add a drug that increases the activity of cyclic amp phosphodiesterase d you add a drug that inhibits adenylyl cyclase e you mutate the campbinding sites in the regulatory subunits of pka so that the pka binds more tightly to camp  calmodulin a protein found in all eucaryotic cells mediates many of the cell changes that occur in response to changes in ca levels calmodulin does not seem to have any enzymatic activity explain how calmodulin is nonetheless able to mediate calciumdependent changes in the cell  the olfactory receptor neurons in frogs resemble those of mammals in that they express olfactory receptors that are coupled to a g protein when the g protein is activated it activates an adenylyl cyclase to produce camp which then opens cyclicamp gated cation channels in the plasma membrane the opening of these channels depolarizes the membrane leading to the production of an action potential your friend is interested in why neurons stop responding to an odor after prolonged exposure to it a process called adaptation he has conducted experiments examining the depolarization of the olfactory receptor neuron the binding of odorant to the receptor the activation of the g protein the levels of camp in the cell and the phosphorylation of adenylyl cyclase his results are summarized in table q table q from these results what step in the odor transduction pathway is altered to elicit adaptation propose a possible molecular mechanism to explain why olfactory neurons no longer respond to an odor after prolonged exposure to it  the inappropriate expression of a metabotropic glutamate receptor called grm in melanocytes causes melanomas grm is normally expressed in neurons and not in melanocytes but ectopic expression of grm in mouse melanocytes is sufficient on its own to induce melanoma development interestingly the effects of grm activity in melanoma cells depends on ras activity your friend works in a pharmaceutical company that develops anticancer drugs she offers to collaborate with you to study new cures for melanoma you discuss the use of a drug that her company has developed that stimulates rasgap activity your friend tells you that this drug has been tested as a possible treatment for several cancers but has failed recent work indicates that those cancers have a hyperactive mutant form of ras which is locked into a gtpbound active state this mutant form of ras is resistant to rasgap gtpase stimulation explain why your friend’s drug may be worth testing on patients with grmexpressing melanoma cells even though it has not worked on some other cancer cells  explain how the notch protein can both bind to the delta ligand at the cell surface and also interact with the dnabinding protein rbpsuh in the nucleus chapter  the cytoskeleton questions  actinbinding proteins can modify the properties of actin you purify an actinbinding protein called abp you examine the effect of abp on actin polymerization by measuring the kinetics of in vitro actin filament formation in which pure actin is added in the presence and the absence of purified abp protein you obtain the results shown in figure q figure q further experiments show that abp binds to the side of actin filaments and preferentially binds to adpcontaining actin filaments propose a possible molecular mechanism consistent with the data above  you have discovered a new cytoskeletal polymer that resembles actin in an archaean you call the subunit for this polymer aalp for archaea actinlike protein aalp binds to atp and can catalyze the hydrolysis of atp to adp as with actin this hydrolysis occurs more quickly when aalp is in a filament and most of the free aalp is bound to atp you measure the rate of aalp filament growth in vitro at the plus more quickly growing end and at the minus more slowly growing end and obtain the graph diagrammed in figure q figure q a what is the critical concentration for the plus end b what is the critical concentration for the minus end c under what conditions would you expect to see treadmilling occur  your friend has been examining the assembly of tubulin dimers into microtubules she has been performing in vitro polymerization experiments in the presence of a single centrosome and finds that she can grow microtubules readily even at concentrations of less than  µm tubulin dimers she has repeated this experiment several times varying the concentrations of tubulin dimers and finds that at  µm tubulin dimers she can create about  microtubules per centrosome however when she doubles the concentration of tubulin dimers she does not seem to be able to create many more than  microtubules per centrosome a given that the critical concentration for microtubules is  µm explain why she can grow microtubules at  µm b can you explain why she seems to have reached a limit as to how many microtubules she can polymerize  your friend works in a lab that examines microtubules he decides to grow some microtubules using gmpcppbound tubulin dimers gmpcpp is analog of gtp that cannot be hydrolyzed to gdp a will he observe dynamic instability in his gmpcppbound microtubules explain b next he decides to add gtpbound tubulin dimers to his preformed gmpcppbound microtubules to these new microtubules he adds a fluorescently labeled microtubulebinding protein mbp and he sees three different patterns of protein binding  microtubules that are labeled along the center only  microtubules that are labeled along the center and at the very tip  microtubules that are labeled all along their length the percentages of microtubules falling into each category are diagrammed in figure q figure q where on a normal microtubule would you expect mbp to bind explain  you have purified a protein mt that binds only to gtpbound tubulin you proceed to fuse mt to gfp and find that the fusion of gfp to mt does not disrupt mt function in any way good news you use a different dye to label the microtubules in red so that you can visualize mtgfp and the microtubules at the same time note that the red dye does not affect the microtubule’s properties a if you were to polymerize some redlabeled microtubules in a dish would you expect mtgfp to be associated with one or both ends of a microtubule with the middle of the microtubule or be evenly distributed throughout the microtubule explain b you examine the red microtubules and mtgfp in a cell in interphase do you think that you will see mtgfp associating with all microtubules explain c if you were to take timelapse images in which you visualize only mtgfp and not microtubules what would you expect to see describe what you think would happen to mtgfp over time with respect to its localization inside of this cell  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als is associated with abnormal assembly of neurofilaments and overexpression of either nfl or nfh two neurofilament proteins in transgenic mice can lead to an alslike disease the simultaneous overexpression of nfl however reverses the pathologies caused by overexpression of nfh and vice versa given what you know about neurofilaments explain this finding  the movement of molecular motors depends on the conformational changes that the proteins undergo as they proceed through the cycle of nucleotide binding hydrolysis and release a muscle contraction uses large amounts of atp what are the two main uses of atp during muscle contraction b if you were to add a nonhydrolyzable form of atp to myosin at what point would you block its movement how is this similar to or different from adding a nonhydrolyzable form of atp to kinesin  constitutive activation of the gtpase cdc leads to a different set of actin rearrangements from those brought about by constitutive activation of the gtpase rho it is now known that wasp proteins are targets of cdc whereas formins are targets of rho both wasp and formins promote actin polymerization explain why the activation of these two different types of actin polymerizationenhancing molecules could lead to differences in the actin cytoskeleton chapter  the cell cycle questions  you want to study the cell cycle in fish embryo cells in which the cell cycle length is about  min you examine the amount of mcyclin in these cells and see that it varies over the cell cycle your friend works in a pharmaceutical company where they are making drugs that block the cell cycle she gives you some of their secret drug called mi and you add it to cells examine mcyclin and get the results shown in figure q figure q a from these data would you predict that cells treated with mi are arrested in the cell cycle at various stages g s g or m or do you predict that cells will be blocked at a particular stage if you think cells will be blocked at a particular stage describe the stage at which you think the cells would be blocked b from the data propose a simple molecular explanation for how mi acts to block the cell cycle  you have isolated a strain of mutant fission yeast that divides normally at °c but arrests in the cell cycle before m phase at °c these mutant yeast cells are not defective in the production of m–cdk because you have isolated the mitotic cyclin and mitotic cdk from these mutant yeast and find that both proteins are normal and can form an m–cdk complex at both temperatures which of the following types of mutations could be responsible for the behavior of this strain of yeast explain a inactivation of an enzyme that ubiquitylates m–cyclin b inactivation of the wee kinase c inactivation of the cak kinase d the continuous production of a phosphatase that removes all phosphate groups from the m–cdk  your friend works in a lab that studies origin licensing he is particularly interested in the prereplicative complex prerc and has isolated a temperaturesensitive yeast mutant that does not seem to assemble the prerc at the origins of replication however he has gotten into an argument with a new student in the lab the student thinks that this yeast mutant will arrest in late mitosis or early g because that is when the prerc is normally assembled your friend disagrees who is right and why  you have identified a drug id that causes m–cdk protein levels to remain high in the cell you have two favorite models for how id works model  id activates a transcription factor that stimulates the genes encoding m–cyclin and m–cdk so that excess m–cdk protein is produced model  id inhibits the activity of the cdc–apcc complex that normally targets m–cdk for destruction your friend works in a lab with many fancy microscopes and offers to examine cells that are treated with drug she sees that cells treated with id assemble a mitotic spindle and their chromosomes seem to align at the metaphase plate however the chromosome segregation seen during normal anaphase does not occur does this new information cause you to favor model  or model  explain  your friend comes to you in a panic he was purifying extracts from interphase cells as well as mitotic cells unfortunately the labels came off his tubes and he cannot tell which extract is from which cells you do an experiment in which you add a small amount of each extract to fluorescent microtubules you have polymerized in vitro and then use video microscopy to follow the behavior of individual microtubules in the reaction over time your results are shown in the graphs in figure q figure q which extract do you think is from mitotic cells and which from interphase cells why  you have just read a paper that the addition of caffeine to cells disrupts the dna damage checkpoint and you would like to understand why by searching for proteins that bind to caffeine you isolate a protein caf you believe that caf is involved in the dna damage checkpoint because when you delete caf from yeast cells and add a drug that causes dna damage the cells fail to arrest in the cell cycle you give your cafdeleted cells to an undergraduate in the laboratory and ask him to take care of the strain for you while you take the weekend off to celebrate your finding upon your return you find the poor undergraduate in tears he explains that he thinks that he messed up the caf mutant strain while you were gone because after growing caf and wildtype cells in rich media and examining them during mitosis caf mutants looked the same the same as wildtype cells are you concerned about the undergraduate student’s findings why  chromosomes are attached to microtubules via the kinetochore given the organization of the mitotic spindle chromosomes should be attached to the plus ends of the kinetochore microtubules your friend is interested in studying the protein collar in the kinetochore that is thought to bind to the growing end of a microtubule he conducts the following experiment first he creates stable microtubules in the presence of gmpcpp a nonhydrolyzable analogue of gtp next he adds gtptubulin to the gmpcpp microtubules finally he adds the kinetochore protein collar to the microtubules to see where they bind he finds a large proportion of the protein collars binding to the middle of microtubules and very few binding to the ends of the microtubules is this finding inconsistent with this protein being part of the kinetochore explain  multicellular animals have some mechanism to control cell mass that we do not understand for example salamanders of different ploidies are the same size such that a haploid a diploid and a pentaploid organism are about the same size however a yeast cell differs in size according to ploidy such that a diploid yeast cell is about half the size of a tetraploid yeast cell given these observations explain why yeast and salamanders are not so different chapter  apoptosis questions  you are working in a laboratory investigating the effects of new chemicals called x and y that kill cells to test whether x and y cause necrosis or apoptosis you briefly treat cultured cells with each chemical and perform several assays a first you examine the chromosomal dna you isolate dna from cells label ¢ ends with radioactive atp by using polynucleotide kinase run the dna on a gel and detect radiolabeled fragments your results are shown in figure qa the lane from the untreated control cells is labeled u does x cause apoptosis what about y explain the origin of the ladder in the y lane b second you examine the subcellular localization of cytochrome c using immunofluorescence microscopy unfortunately during sample preparation you mixed up the samples assign a likely identity u x or y to the samples labeled   and  in figure qb c third without making the cells permeable in any way you stain them with annexin v linked to a green fluorophore which binds phosphatidylserine and propidium iodide which fluoresces red when it binds dna neither of these compounds can travel across intact plasma membranes again during sample preparation you mixed up the samples assign a likely identity to the samples in figure qc annexin v staining is shown as  hatching propidium iodide staining is shown as  hatching and staining with both in the same region appears as crosshatching figure q  you want to find out why apoptosis fails to occur in several cell lines derived from tumors to identify differences between the tumor cell lines t t and t and a control cell line c that might prevent tumor cells from undergoing normal apoptosis you isolate proteins from cells that have  or have not – been treated to induce apoptosis you load the protein samples on gels and perform immunoblotting with antibodies against proteins involved in apoptosis confusingly several proteins have altered levels or altered apparent sizes in the tumor cell lines as shown in figure q suggest a hypothesis for each tumor cell line to explain its apoptosis defect and the immunoblots figure q  in patients with autoimmune diseases the adaptive immune system recognizes some normal cells or proteins as though they were foreign defects in the regulated apoptosis and clearance of cells are thought to cause or exacerbate some autoimmune diseases a explain briefly which cells normally undergo apoptosis and can cause autoimmune disease if they survive inappropriately b explain briefly why a defect in clearance or engulfment of apoptotic bodies might lead to autoimmune disease  cancer cells often exhibit abnormal regulation of the apoptotic program mutations that prevent the normal regulation of apoptosis not only contribute to carcinogenesis but also affect the response to anticancer therapies a describe briefly why a defect in apoptosis is an important step in the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell b describe briefly how a defect in apoptosis will affect the response to anticancer therapies c identify a protein whose overexpression in a cancer cell might inhibit apoptosis d identify a protein whose elimination or underexpression in a cancer cell might inhibit apoptosis  effector procaspases acquire high proteolytic activity only after they have been cleaved by active initiator caspases in contrast purified initiator procaspases can cleave themselves and this autocatalytic cleavage stimulates their activity only modestly biochemical reconstitution experiments demonstrated that high activity of the initiator caspase and caspase required their incorporation into the disc or apoptosome respectively each of these procaspases has an adaptor domain which enables it to assemble with other proteins a prodomain a lowaffinity dimerization domain and a catalytic domain the catalytic domains of these caspases are identical at only  of the amino acids two competing models for the activation of caspase have been proposed in the allosteric model apaf proteins in the apoptosome specifically interact with the catalytic domains of caspase proteins thereby triggering a transition to a catalytically active conformation in the dimerization model apaf proteins simply increase the local concentration of caspase by binding several adaptor domains simultaneously thereby promoting dimerization and coincident activation of caspase to distinguish between these models you make a hybrid protein containing part of caspase and part of caspase as shown in figure q you test whether this hybrid protein can be activated by fas ligand or cytochrome c what do you expect if the allosteric model is correct what do you expect if the dimerization model is correct figure q  several mutational changes to proteins involved in apoptosis are listed below for each indicate whether you expect it to have a dominantnegative phenotype in other words do you expect it to cause a defect in apoptosis even in cells that also contain the normal protein a deletion of death domain of fas death receptor b mutational change to fas ligand that prevents its oligomerization c deletion of the death effector domain of fadd d deletion of the death effector domain of procaspase e deletion of the card domain of apaf f mutation of the catalytic cysteine of caspase to serine g mutational change to bax that prevents its oligomerization with itself and with bak h mutational change to iap that increases its affinity for caspases  a genetic pathway map of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is shown in figure q with empty boxes instead of protein names fill in the boxes with the following proteins caspase bcl antiiap protein apaf cytochrome c executioner caspase bhonly protein iap protein bh protein a ® symbol indicates activation – indicates inhibition figure q  you are investigating how the number of nerve cells is regulated in a specific tissue of your favorite experimental organism you isolate a mutant that contains almost none of these nerve cells in the adult animal and you hypothesize that in this mutant the nerve cells are either not made or do not connect to their target cells and therefore fail to get the survival signals they need you are surprised by the results of a developmental time course that you perform you find that in the mutant more of the nerve cells are made than in controls and they all connect correctly to their target cells but then at later times nearly all of the nerve cells undergo apoptosis what could be the explanation chapter  cell junctions cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix molecular biology of the cell fifth edition questions  your two friends are having an argument henry who works in a lab studying signal transduction claims that ligand–receptor interactions are higher affinity interactions than those between two cadherin molecules in contrast oliver who works in a lab studying the cell junctions claims that the interactions between two cadherin molecules must be stronger because epithelial tissues can be extremely difficult to pull apart and anchoring junctions are joined by forces that are much stronger than the usually transient interactions of a ligand and a receptor who is correct and why  sam the undergraduate working with you in your lab has just asked for help you and sam are investigating the role of the catenin protein at adherens junctions your adviser has asked you to clone the catenin gene by pcr when sam took the pcr clone you produced and sequenced it he found a mutation that would change a conserved arginine to a methionine when sam ran the catenin protein through some webbased protein domainfinding algorithms he found that this arginine was a conserved residue in a predicted nuclearlocalization signal nls and thus figured it did not matter that much because the catenin at adherens junctions must be a cytoplasmic protein to sam’s dismay your adviser was horrified at this news explain why a protein localized at an adherens junction might need an nls  you have purified a large complex of proteins that are at the presynaptic membranes of some neurons that you believe contribute to cold tolerance in drosophila you have purified six different proteins from this complex that you name cld to cld you discover that cld is a transmembrane protein that seems to interact physically with cld and none of the other cld proteins you create mutations in each of the genes that encode these proteins and examine the localization of the other “cold” proteins in each mutant background and get the results shown in table q table q which of the six cld proteins is the best candidate for a scaffolding molecule explain  you are interested in epithelial tissue formation and work in a lab studying madin–darby canine kidney mdck cells mdck cells spontaneously form hollow epithelial vesicles staining these vesicles with an antiactin antibody demonstrates the existence of apical microvilli near the central cavity of the vesicle a new postdoctoral fellow in the lab comes to you in a panic you had given her some dissociated mdck cells that have been cultured as single cells in a collagen matrix because the cells did not look obviously polarized to her she stained the dissociated mdck cells to visualize the microvilli and she does not see any signs of polarized microvilli localization in these cells explain why you are confident that you did not give her the wrong cell line and suggest a better experiment that will allow her to test whether the cells you gave her are mdck cells  you are interested in integrin activation and perform mutagenesis studies on integrin you find a mutant form of integrin which you call intact because the intact mutation causes the extracellular domain to exist always in an unfolded state regardless of the presence or absence of ligand when you determine the sequence of intact you find that the mutation is in the intracellular domain of integrin explain how this intracellular mutation could affect the conformation of the extracellular domain of integrin  your friend who is an engineering major is interested in the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix and wants to study how secreted collagen molecules assemble into a collagen fiber as part of his studies he has been trying to speed up the rate at which cells can produce the collagen protein and is considering reducing the size of the propeptide that is attached to the collagen chain such that it contains only the er targeting sequence as well as the site for cleavage of the propeptide to his surprise this modification causes collagen to be degraded inside the cell can you explain why  you are interested in studying the extracellular matrix and its interaction with cell signaling and have isolated a new signaling molecule important for whisker cell proliferation in mice that you call wgf you decide to test whether the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans are required for wgf signaling by creating several lines of transgenic mice you create one line of mice that does not produce any wgf and one line of mice that cannot add any heparan sulfate chains onto proteoglycans you find that wgf– mice and heparan sulfate– mice both lack whiskers whereas wildtype mice have whiskers a explain whether this is consistent with a role for proteoglycans in wgf signaling you decide to carry out further experiments by creating transgenic mice that overexpress wgf using mouse genetics you create mice that overexpress wgf but lack heparan sulfate you see that some normallooking whiskers are produced in these animals b given this new result and the data above do you think that the fact that these wgfoverexpressing mice can produce normallooking whiskers is consistent with a role for proteoglycans in wgf signaling explain  you are working in a lab studying cell wall deposition in plants you are about to start a set of experiments examining the interactions of microtubules with cellulose synthase when your friend shows you a set of relatively recent papers that show how the treatment of plant cells with either the microtubuledestabilizing drug oryzalin or the microtubulestabilizing drug taxol does not alter the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils deposited during the time of drug treatment are these results consistent with the current model of how microtubules are involved in cellulose deposition why ls chapter  cancer questions  identify the two errors in this statement “cells from a benign lung tumor that has metastasized to the liver no longer make any lungspecific proteins”  carcinogenesis requires that a single cell or one of its descendents undergo a series of rare genetic and epigenetic changes that permanently alter the expression of at least five to eight genes thus it is not surprising that many cancer cells assayed in cell culture dishes were found to have a very high rate of mutagenesis a what are three systems that are often defective in cancer cells whose role is to ensure the integrity of the genome b the increased mutation rate speeds cancer progression by increasing the likelihood that a cell will acquire additional properties that contribute to carcinogenesis name four of the eight typical properties of cancer cells c uv and ionizing radiation are known to cause cancer because they are mutagens that damage dna how then are the many anticancer therapies that act by damaging dna including ionizing radiation and many drugs so effective at shrinking tumors d are these therapies more or less effective on cancer stem cells than cancer transit amplifying cells explain  you are an epidemiologist trying to understand why the incidence of breast cancer is unusually high in marin county california a community in which large proportions of residents both women and men have advanced educational degrees and highpaying jobs a list five critical questions that you must include on a questionnaire given to residents of marin county and as a control to residents of other counties in the usa b would you expect an elevated incidence of breast cancer to correlate more closely with socioeconomic status or with exposure to industrial chemicals  figure q shows a signaling pathway that is turned on inappropriately in many human cancers the key proteins and their positive or negative influences on each other are shown a both pten and akt are cancercritical genes which is a tumor suppressor which is a protooncogene b the pathway contains additional cancercritical genes name a potential protooncogene and a potential tumor suppressor in this pathway c is it likely that more than one of these pathway components will be mutated in a single tumor explain d if many tumors were found to contain two mutations in this pathway what hypothesis would it suggest figure q  loss of a tumor suppressor gene usually promotes cancer only if both copies are defective a if a person inherits two functional copies of the gene will the frequency of mutation of the second copy be higher or lower than the frequency of mutation of the first copy explain by describing the mechanisms by which the gene can be mutated b you determine by immunoblotting that a tumor lacks a specific tumor suppressor protein then you sequence the regulatory and coding regions of the corresponding tumor suppressor gene and find that one copy has a premature stop codon near the beginning of the gene and the other copy contains no mutations what is the most likely mechanism that prevents the production or accumulation of protein from the unmutated copy  the p gene may be the most important gene preventing human cancer this gene is mutated in about half of all cancers and the pathway in which it participates is mutated in essentially all cancers a we can envisage two mechanisms to increase the amount of p protein when it is suddenly needed first transcription and translation of the p gene might be low in the absence of a stimulus and markedly increased after stimulation second transcription and translation of the p gene might be high at all times but the protein amount is normally low as a result of proteolytic degradation after stimulation degradation is inhibited and consequently the protein amount increases the latter mechanism is actually used by cells suggest the most important advantage of this mechanism b list two of the four major classes of stimuli that evoke increased p amounts in normal human cells c a defect in p increases the likelihood of amplification of protooncogenes and loss of tumor suppressor genes describe the two ways in which p normally works to prevent these outcomes describe the sequence of steps that can lead to these outcomes in the absence of p  common side effects of anticancer chemotherapy include nausea diarrhea hair loss dry skin anemia reduced immune system function and increased frequency of bruising and bleeding a although many of the best chemotherapy drugs successfully kill most tumor cells they often cause side effects by killing normal epithelial cells and fail to kill cancer stem cells how does the mode of action of these drugs cause these two problems b describe a strategy for developing drugs with fewer side effects  you work for a pharmaceutical company that is developing new anticancer drugs in clinical trials with a new potential treatment for stomach cancer you find that your drug is effective at eliminating all signs of the cancer in  of the patients tested but is completely ineffectual in the remaining  will you abandon development of the drug on the basis of these results what data will you collect to inform your decision    related reviews there are no

of california san francisco he has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide he is known as an original author of the canonical influential and bestselling scientific textbook molecular biology of the cell and as editorinchief of science magazine alberts was the president of the national academy of sciences from  to  he is known for his work in forming science public policy and has served as united states science envoy to pakistan and indonesia he has stated that science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting for all citizens that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements contents  education  career  science and education  international work  publications  awards and honours  references  external links educationedit after graduating from new trier high school in winnetka illinois alberts attended harvard college as a premedicine major bored by assigned laboratory cooking classes he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor jacques fresco in paul m dotys laboratory the summers research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of dna and rna and alberts decided to continue on in biophysics he graduated with his ab in biochemical sciences summa cum laude in  alberts then worked with paul m doty on an enormously ambitious thesis on dna replication attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of dna polymerase after failing his first oral examination in spring  he completed his phd research in fall  his doctorate in biophysics was published by harvard university in  alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes that was a very important learning experience for me i had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science and nobody had ever told me anything about this careeredit after graduating alberts went to the institut de biologie moleculaire at the university of geneva as a postdoctoral fellow and worked with richard h epstein on genes involved in dna replication of phage t epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of t dna alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing and developed a dna column for the purification of proteins that bound to dna this enabled him to purify t bacteriophage gene  in  alberts joined the department of biochemical sciences at princeton university as an assistant professor in  he became an associate professor and in  a full professor holding the damon pfeiffer professorship in life sciences from  at princeton he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry reconstituting systems in  alberts accepted a position as professor and vicechair of the department of biochemistry and biophysics at the university of california san francisco also in  he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to doublestranded dna in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make dna more years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved another important step in understanding dna synthesis was realizing that leading strand dna polymerase and lagging strand dna polymerase were coupled alberts was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  from  to  alberts held the american cancer society research

illinois is an american biochemist and the chancellor’s leadership chair in biochemistry and biophysics for science and education at the university of california san francisco he has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide he is known as an original author of the canonical influential and bestselling scientific textbook molecular biology of the cell and as editorinchief of science magazine alberts was the president of the national academy of sciences from  to  he is known for his work in forming science public policy and has served as united states science envoy to pakistan and indonesia he has stated that science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting for all citizens that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements contents  education  career  science and education  international work  publications  awards and honours  references  external links educationedit after graduating from new trier high school in winnetka illinois alberts attended harvard college as a premedicine major bored by assigned laboratory cooking classes he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor jacques fresco in paul m dotys laboratory the summers research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of dna and rna and alberts decided to continue on in biophysics he graduated with his ab in biochemical sciences summa cum laude in  alberts then worked with paul m doty on an enormously ambitious thesis on dna replication attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of dna polymerase after failing his first oral examination in spring  he completed his phd research in fall  his doctorate in biophysics was published by harvard university in  alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes that was a very important learning experience for me i had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science and nobody had ever told me anything about this careeredit after graduating alberts went to the institut de biologie moleculaire at the university of geneva as a postdoctoral fellow and worked with richard h epstein on genes involved in dna replication of phage t epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of t dna alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing and developed a dna column for the purification of proteins that bound to dna this enabled him to purify t bacteriophage gene  in  alberts joined the department of biochemical sciences at princeton university as an assistant professor in  he became an associate professor and in  a full professor holding the damon pfeiffer professorship in life sciences from  at princeton he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry reconstituting systems in  alberts accepted a position as professor and vicechair of the department of biochemistry and biophysics at the university of california san francisco also in  he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to doublestranded dna in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make dna more years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved another important step in understanding dna synthesis was realizing that leading strand dna polymerase and lagging strand dna polymerase were coupled alberts was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  from  to  alberts held the american cancer society research professorship a title granted for life as of  from  to  he was chair of
