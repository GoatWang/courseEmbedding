main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview with ilene gordon ceo of ingredion a company that turns raw materials into ingredients for the food beverage and other industries was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q what are some leadership lessons you’ve learned from mentors over the yearsa there was one gentleman in particular he had three daughters and his attitude was “look you’re really smart you’re very ambitious and focused i can help teach you about business” this was around  and i’d already been out of business school for several years he made it a priority to help me to hone my business skillsi was a strategist by training and i was doing acquisitions i was smart i was analytical but he said to me “you ought to run some of these businesses and see how good your analysis was it may look great on paper but you have to motivate and inspire people you’re  years old and the guy you’re leading is  how do you get the best out of him that’s your challenge”so early on this mentor gave me that opportunity to run businesses i’ve been running them since i was  advertisement continue reading the main story he had a philosophy of putting people in jobs that were bigger than they were if somebody has talent and good people skills and drive i think you can stretch them and put them in a job that they’re not quite ready for so they grow into it that’s what people did for me so i’m a big believer in doing that and taking young people and stretching them continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story and employees love to hear that because they feel like they’re going to get opportunities there’s a big competition for talent people will leave their company if they think they’ll have more opportunities elsewhere so you need to offer opportunities to your young people and you’ll have a much better retentionit’s not all about a  percent raise it’s really about opportunity i’m taking these lessons in how people treated me as a young professional and use those lessons today to excite our peopleq how do you know if somebody’s able to stretch into a big new joba one question somebody once asked me was “what do you think are important attributes to be successful in leadership” i said it’s about tenacity it’s never giving up it’s having a plan b and that’s one of my favorite expressions have a plan b because plan a doesn’t always go well or maybe it’s derailed by a competitor or somebody else’s new product or some type of regulation photo ilene gordon is ceo of ingredion which turns raw materials into ingredients for the food beverage and other industries credit andrea mohinthe new york times my point is to always have a plan b that you can implement maybe you have to go to plan c or d but the point is that you always have to have a backup plani look for young people who have a lot of energy and who treat other people well because we’re not looking for bullies some people push their way through things and they’re not collaborative i look for people who don’t give up who are very focused and organized but are also able to collaborate with other people because in today’s organizations you actually may not have anybody directly reporting to you but may have a team of  people from other parts of the organization they’re your virtual teamso i look for young people who have the energy and drive to get things done to keep their eye on where they’re going but at the same time realize they can’t do it alone it’s not just a oneperson show you can’t be the micromanager you have to be able to get things done through others newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you

what else do you do to help develop younger managersa i use one dinner a year with my board to bring in young highpotential managers we have everybody give an “elevator speech” you have three minutes to tell the board and other people in the room where you came from the challenges you’re facing and how you’re trying to create value for the company everybody might want to take  minutes but you have to be succinctthis is part of what we’re looking for in people who have potential it’s all about communication what are the challenges you have and you have three minutes to explain them because there are  of you and we’re going to be here all night otherwise and if you take somebody else’s time that’s not respectful it’s all about being succinct and articulate advertisement continue reading the main story q what questions do you ask when you hire what qualities do you look for in job candidatesa i like to look at the person’s résumé and ask a lot of questions about how they made decisions to go from one company to the other did they have a plan not everybody has to have a structured plan but i like to hear their thought process did they make things happen for themselves and their companies or was it just serendipity and serendipity is sometimes ok tooso that’s how i get into the interview and get people talking but the key question i always ask going back to my own theme is who mentored you who did you learn from because i feel that with the people we’re hiring we’re hiring all their mentors too i want to know if they learned from somebody who was an operating expert or somebody who was a strategist and what companies those mentors worked in that’s because i’m not just hiring the person sitting there i’m hiring the four people who mentored him i don’t think there’s anybody who’s successful in their role today who hasn’t been mentored by somebodybusiness is always challenging it doesn’t always go well and plan a doesn’t always work so i look for people who have dealt with some adversity in their life it could have been in business — maybe their company was acquired and they had to figure out what they wanted to do and made a change rather than sitting around for two years lamenting “why me”or somebody might have lost their parents early on the point is they’ve dealt with some type of adversity or illness and they came back and they perseveredthat’s what i look for because very few people have had perfect lives you want people who are able to have a plan b and c and to rise above a challenge move ahead and just get on with it and have that cando

do you do when your leading product becomes public health enemy no  if youre ilene gordon the dealmaking chief executive of ingredient and foodflavoringmaker ingredion you blow up the company and reinvent it gordon  took over the top spot at the sleepy company then called corn products international in  among her first moves was shifting the company away from highfructose corn syrup a cash cow yet a muchmaligned sweetener used in soft drinks baked goods and processed foods then gordon put in motion a plan to engineer the companys overhaul through a string of acquisitions a change in strategy and transformation of the centuryold firms culture her plan is now bearing fruit helping push its stock up more than  percent yeartodate on strong sales and betterthanexpected margins while her approach initially was viewed by some inside the westchesterbased company as radical and overly aggressive few are complaining now as the profits roll in and its stock this year hit an alltime high “not only was she a visionary she probably saved the company” says erik gordon no relation a professor at the university of michigans ross school of business “whatever the facts are about highfructose corn syrup this fact is also true highfructose corn syrup is a lousy business to be in” while ingredion—whose primary function is converting raw products like corn rice tapioca and other plants into food ingredients—still sells the product it represents less than  percent of total sales down from north of  percent when gordon took over her journey to diversify started in  with the  billion purchase of national starch a bridgewater njbased innovator in food ingredients and specialty starches that operated  plants in eight countries that acquisition gave ingredion a foothold in food textures new capabilities in research and development as well as a new roster of customers “we used the acquisition to really transform the company and refocus on putting together products that are very much ontrend” gordon says the trend toward clean labels and niche nutrition “was all just accelerating in  back then you may have had one friend who was glutenfree today there are so many people who avoid gluten” gordons timing says robert moskow an analyst at credit suisse was excellent because it came as food processors and beverage companies were beginning to explore reformulating their products to remove artificial flavors colors and other ingredients to meet changing consumer demand “she deserves a lot of credit for having that foresight” he says perhaps most important gordon used national starch as a catalyst for taking a more proactive approach with customers instead of simply taking orders for corn products legacy commodity ingredients her sales teams were prodded to start asking what products its customers were developing and how the new ingredion could help “thats her greatest accomplishment with the company” moskow says “she turned around the culture of a yearold company and thats not an easy thing to do” gordon says ingredions customers were “really ready to engage with us very early in the process” and her team was prepared to help them start developing more healthful recipes “to meet this unmet market need” the market has responded favorably shares closed sept  at  up  percent since the closing price the day she became ceo today investors and analysts remain bullish on ingredions prospects as it moves headlong into developing new plantbased proteins food colorings and flavorings texturizers and other allnatural food additives to realign itself with consumers preferences through its internal idea labs unit ingredion is working with packagedfoods companies to make their products more nutritious and more “clean label” “our challenge has been to figure out clever ways to use whole foods to replace processed foods” says tony delio ingredions vice president of global innovation that means adding color with carrots or beets

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
