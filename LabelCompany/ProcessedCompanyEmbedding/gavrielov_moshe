register electronics weekly electronics design  components tech news home » news » products » programmable logic and asic add to bookmarks by staff th july  q interview – moshe gavrielov xilinx moshe gavrielov joined xilinx as ceo in january he talks to electronics weekly about the challenges facing the fpga supplier as it moves from pure vanilla to soc with your background in the asic and design software markets you have taken a fresh look at the fpga market and i believe you have concluded that programmable technology has not lived up to its potential is this still your view all markets show common themes – the importance of timetoomarket tight rd budgets and increasing complexity i hear customers still telling me that their end markets are very fickle and it is hard to determine what their customers really want so i conclude that programmable logic should be going gangbusters but it isn’t the market was generally flat in  and looking ahead i see annual growth of between  and  so what needs to change the programmable world is going through a transition in some respects it is similar to the move from the gate array to standard cell in the asic market this means the traditional vanilla fpga is changing in to a market driven product and this is not a trivial change do you have the right technologies for this ‘new world’ of application specific fpgas in some respects it requires more than what we have there are two aspects to the change we are going through a move to a platform approach and a greater focus on power     to look at the fpga platform first we are adding an ever higher hardwired element into the programmable architecture the move from th and th generations of virtex showed big changes fpga industry q what are your thoughts on the challenges facing the fpga industry email your comments to richardwilsonrbicouk at the high end products are increasingly defined by the processor architecture but to do this without taking away design flexibility for our wider customer base this is the problem we are trying to address i believe we can continue to support the wider customer base we have the ip  on the power side i see opportunities to increase power efficiencies i see opportunities to take technologies from the standard product world and bring these to the fpga world this includes process technology and architectures but also packaging and software this is a big focus for rd for us but these are very early days currently you offer high performance powerpc  and powerpc  bit hard processors and the more flexible bit microblaze soft processor do you expect to see any additions to your processor strategy would you consider taking an arm licence we have the right technology for the traditional telecoms industrial military markets but for other markets we need to make sure we have the right solution we need to do things in the areas of cost and power we will have the appropriate processor architectures for these consumer orientated markets so with this focus on processordefined systems is xilinx becoming a systemonchip company yes in a sense it is true that we are changing from being technology driven to market driven and as a result we are becoming more viable for the centre of the system to do this we must understand the needs of the customer and we have over  customers as i said earlier it is not a trivial change we are going through   let us know what you think if you would like to enter the debate email the editor at richardwilsonrbicouk  see also q – interviews with electronics industry leadersread
