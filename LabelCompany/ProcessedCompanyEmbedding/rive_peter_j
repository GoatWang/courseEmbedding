and socioeconomic impacts  climate change is the single most pressing global issue facing society today one estimate suggests that a climateinduced global sea level rise of just one meter will cost  trillion us dollars to world economies freshwater coastal ecosystems  in addition to the most basic need for safe drinking water the availablity of good quality freshwater affects nearly every aspect of modern life including energy resources food production transportation manufacturing and recreation as well as supporting ecological wellbeing and the ecosystem services on which life depends   see all seed projects offshore wind energy in the great lakes  the project brings together a team of engineers ecologists and policy experts to examine wind farm systems in terms of integrity performance ecological impacts and policy issues energy efficient seawater desalination and food processing  reverse osmosis is a water purification method that uses a semipermeable membrane to desalinate seawater into drinkable water while promising it’s a relatively expensive technology microbial pollution in lake erie using nextgeneration sequencing to examine microbial community interactions and their relationship to flow patterns  lake erie provides drinking water to the region habitat for wildlife and it’s a mecca for fishing and recreation however microbial pollution in the lake threatens human and ecosystem health as well as local economies and future economic development toward rational design of nextgeneration renewable energy materials photovoltaics from materials to device model  materials design and discovery hold a critical place in the st century economy with broad impact that spans the transportation health microelectronic and renewable energy industries combining highresolution airmass trajectory modeling and climate data to generate precipitation predictions that are useful for policymakers  accurate projections and accessible information about the impacts of
