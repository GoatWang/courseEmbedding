would like to thank ms carol farquhar northwestern university for her assistance in designing and analyzing this study abstract  this paper presents the results of an exploration of linear effects in cognitive response on cognitive structure specifically elicited cognitive response to advertising stimuli were related to beliefs and purchase intent associated with the advertised product a strong linear relationship was found between supportive arguing responses and related cognitive structure measures introduction interest in the joint cognitive responsecognitive structure model for studying the impact of persuasive communication has grown since its early presentation by lutz and swasy  a number of studies have been reported which attempt to link the number of cognitive responses to a communication stimulus usually in the form of advertising with a corresponding effect upon elements of cognitive structure olson toy and dover  for example studying specifically five levels of price information demonstrated a strong relationship between the number of counterarguments and support arguments as related to the amount of information contained in several advertisements wilson and muderrisoglu   have utilized much the same procedure applying the model to an analysis of comparative advertising in each case strong support for the notion of the number of cognitive responses elicited from an advertising communication stimuli mediating cognitive structure was shown all of this research however has been concerned with the total or average number of cognitive responses elicited by the communication stimuli accepting the basic hypothesis that there is a relationship on the macro level between the number of cognitive responses and the effect upon cognitive structure measures it is the purpose of this paper to explore beyond the total effect and consider the functional relationship between different magnitudes of cognitive response upon cognitive structure more specifically what will be explored is whether respondents exhibiting greater cognitive activity operationally defined as offering a greater number of cognitive responses also exhibit a corresponding change in cognitive structure methodology selection of experimental stimuli and respondents the methodology was designed to test the theory of individual intensity in cognitive response by utilizing both specific communication test stimuli as well as the general experience of respondents the specific experimental stimuli used consisted of two television commercials for a wellknown brand of frozen food with a high positive image each commercial featured a variety of products one with several people featured one only a couple in addition one group of respondents was not exposed to a commercial and was asked only to think shout advertising for the product with which they were familiar to ensure a realistic response subjects were carefully screened to be certain only those people who belong to the products target market and who had experience with the product category were included a total of  respondents were interviewed female household heads  with family incomes over   in each of three widely distributed geographical markets onethird of the respondents in each market received each of the treatment conditions respondents in each city were randomly assigned to treatment cells those assigned to the first two cells were exposed to one of two television commercials each respondent was exposed independently and asked to watch the commercial very carefully leaning everything from it that they felt the advertiser wanted them to know next following the general procedure advanced by greenwald  and discussed by others cf calder insko and yandell  wright  and  respondents were asked to relate all of their thoughts while viewing the commercial respondents in the third cell were not shown any specific advertising rather they were asked for all of the things that come to mind when thinking of looking at or reading advertisements for the product in all treatment cells thoughts were elicited and recorded one at a time after all thoughts were recorded a series of questions were asked relating to selected cognitive structure measures each respondent was asked how likely she would be to buy the product advertised measured over a fivepoint likert type scale then how strongly she felt the product reflected specific beliefs associated with the advertising using a seven point balanced attitude scale analytic plan initially each of the cognitive responses elicited from a respondent were classified in the manner suggested by wright  supportive arguments were classified as those thoughts beyond a simple copypoint playback which evidenced a favorable reaction to the product its use or the belief messages communicated counterarguments were those thoughts that were generally directed against the product or its use and those that refuted message claims in addition to these critical responses three other categories were recorded positive and negative adrelated thoughts which addressed only the executional elements and neutral statements then rather than averaging the total number of responses elicited for each classification those respondents offering only one thought within a classification two thoughts etc were grouped in this way it is possible to preserve the frequency of individual cognitive responses by type of response each of these distributions was compared over the three treatment cells it was hypothesized that there should be no significant difference in the general distribution of cognitive response between cells at least for the important supportive and counterarguments since the two commercial stimuli used had been pretested and both communicated the same general message beliefs and importantly these were the same message beliefs generally communicated through the advertising for this brand over the last several years a campaign which included one of the two commercial tested here as a result those respondents not directly stimulated by a specific commercial should nonetheless have exhibited the same or at least similar general cognitive structures to those exposed to the commercials incidence of responses were then compared with cognitive structure measures of belief and intention to buy in order to establish whether a linear relationship might mediate cognitive structure results table  shows the mean number of cognitive responses offered by classification for each treatment cell studied the high number of supportive arguments vs other types of cognitive responses is no doubt a function of the existing highly positive image of the product table  summary of mean number of cognitive responses elicited it is generally accepted cf slash toy and dover  that positive and negative adrelated responses as well as neutral responses do not mediate cognitive structure for this reason along with the fact that very few respondents provided positive or negative adrelated responses only supportive arguments and counterarguments will be analyzed furthermore because of the very low total number of counterarguments elicited and the fact that  of the  respondents offering a counterargument gave only one the statistical analysis will further be restricted to only the supportive arguments the distribution of supportive arguments between treatment cells is shown in table  little difference in either the overall distribution or average number of arguments elicited appears to be in evidence a chisquare analysis of the distribution indicated no significant difference between the distributions x   df   p   table  distribution of supportive arguments these results would suggest that there is no significant difference in the general difference in the general distribution of cognitive responses or at least in this case supportive arguments among treatment cells therefore the subsequent analysis permits us to look at total response over cells where appropriate belief measures for six constructs reflected in the advertising for this product were measured via a seven point attitude differential scale mean beliefs averaged over the six constructs for respondents offering one through five or more supportive argents are shown in table  the one inversion between three and four supportive arguments was primarily the result of one belief constructthe only one showing low overall belief table  mean belief by incidence of supportive arguments a  x  anova of this attitudinal data see table  indicated only support arguments to be statistically significantthis the result of a significantly increasing linear trend as shown in table  as the number of support arguments offered by a respondent increased so did his positive attitudinal evaluation of the product table  analysis of variance for attitudinal data finally the intention to purchase also appears to be strongly mediated by the number of support arguments offered by a subject intention did increase linearly as shown in table  table  intention to purchase an anova of this data indicated that there was a significant difference of this particular measure between treatment cells this was occasioned by a mean purchase intent of  in cell  those who saw one of the commercials vs  and  among those seeing the second commercial and those seeing no commercial respectively one commercial was less effective than either the other commercial or the control in generating purchase interest however there was no interaction between this difference and the number of support arguments elicited and there was a significant linear trend in support arguments as indicated in table  as the number of support arguments offered by an individual respondent increased so did her interest in buying the product table  analysis of variance for purchase interest discussion the results here indicate that there is a strong reason to suspect a linear effect mediating the relationship between cognitive response and cognitive structure overall belief increased with the number of support arguments offered as did intention to purchase because of the high positive image nature of the product involved one is tempted to believe these results are even more significant since both belief and interest are already high to stimulate even greater interest as a function of advertising based cognitive response is surprising unfortunately owing to that same high positive image linear effects among counterarguments could not be tested because of sample size limitations however the trends at least for purchase intent suggested the predicted linear functional relationship that is more counterarguments resulted in lover purchase interest it is reasonable to predict that a similar linear relationship might be observed for products with less positive images here however one is equally likely to suspect that the quality of support arguments not only their existence and frequency might be of significance the elicitation measure used in this study differs considerably from that commonly employed in pretesting and onair testing of advertising most typically tabulations are obtained of the percentage of respondents recalling various messages occasionally responses are tabulated by type of response adrelated sales point related etc rarely if ever is a coding scheme employing cognitive response categories used yet the data presented here strongly suggest that the mean number of responses within cognitive response categories a recalltype measure may be a significant correlate of a motivational construct  purchase interest whether these responses must be precursors of shifts in purchase interest however remains a critical question the findings of this study suggest that segmentation of groups by number of responses might reveal if there is a critical number of support arguments correlated with purchase interest andor if any specific arguments or combinations of support arguments are integral to promoting purchase interest given that the critical number of responses have been elicited additional commercial tests with larger samples would be necessary to explore these questions references calder bobby j insko chester a and yandell ben  the relation of cognitive and memorial

types of advertising are shown to differ both in motivating purchase intent and more fundamentally in the type of underlying response mechanisms generated product users and nonusers predisposed toward purchase are shown to be reacting primarily to the cognitive aspects of the advertising nonusers not predisposed toward purchase were shown to be reacting primarily to the affective elements of the campaigns the results were interpreted in terms of low involvement theory for many people and for many products the commercial is the product people structure their expectations on the basis of the commercial copy and visual images and evaluate product performance against these expectations the commercial may be the consumers only link between product expectations and their basic needs and preferences two types of commercial tactics address this linkage in very different ways in one the product feature characteristic attribute approach a specific productbased attribute is highlighted for example an advertised product may be described as convenient nutritional reliable or expensive in the second approach a consumer endbenefit is highlighted and for example the advertised product may be described as keeping you slim whelping your dog to live longer or preserving your memories film which of these two types of tactics will be more effective specifically in the case of a low calorie food product is it more advantageous to advertise that the product will taste good or that the product will help you look beautiful a more fundamental issue related to this question is the nature of the executional format used in these two different approaches while there is no creative mandate in many product categories attributebased advertising has tended to be of the factual type involving cognitivetype thinking learnfeeldo and executional formats with the product as hero endbenefit advertising has tended to be more image and mood oriented feellearndo and to emphasize affective responses with the consumers reaction the focus for example kodaks commercials have been described by their agency as not intending to offer rational reasons for buying film under the assumption that emotion and not rationality motivates a consumers purchase of film thus which of these two executional formats would be most effective minddirected or stomachoriented is a key concern in developing and implementing advertising strategy consistent with a brands strategic framework prior research on affect in advertising given this distinction between affective and cognitive oriented advertising formats the question of appropriate measures to evaluate the difference arises a review of the literature yields a surprising lack of either empirical research or theoretical approaches to this subject the most similar research thrust seems to be the literature on attitude toward the ad aad versus attitude toward the brand ab here the assumption is explored that affective attitudes toward the advertising itself and not just toward the product may have an impact upon product purchase this idea has stimulated a great deal of recent consumer research interest after all should not someone respond more favorably to a message that is more favorably received than one less favorably received in fact advertising researchers have drawn from a large body of research in the psychology literature that would seemingly support this idea for example bower and his colleagues bower  bower monteiro and gilligan  have studied the relationship between memory and a persons mood during learning tasks in the earlier study it was reported that emotional moot served as a distinctive learningandrecall context primarily when the subject had to keep separate several interfering sets of material would this be a reasonable description of advertising in a clutter environment perhaps but the involvement required in their experiments seems quite beyond what one might expect when presented with most advertising communications bowers  study proposed an associative network theory where emotion serves as a memory unit that can enter into associations with coincident events but here again something must trigger the emotion unit should we expect this to occur in the consumers mind at the pointofpurchase or when otherwise confronted with a brand stimulus srull  has attempted to deal with this question of mood and its relationship to affective reactions to advertising his preliminary findings suggest that initial evaluations are strongly influenced by subjective mood states at the time of information acquisition importantly however he also notes that there were significant interactions between mood state at the time of retrieval and the type of information provided we would offer that this could also tend to mediate relationships between types of message and the impact of affective reactions to the source of that message that is the attitude toward the advertising the seemingly common sense notion that ones reaction to an advertisement will be generalized to the subject of the advertising has been appealing to many advertising researchers as well as practitioners bartos  light  despite zany wellknown examples to the contrary among them the consumerhated white tornado campaign for ajax and ring around the collar campaign for wisk the explanation for the success of these contrary campaigns has been attributed to another body of communication theory  cue discounting  where the receiver was felt to simply forget or disassociate the source of the information from the information itself however an alternative hypothesis has been offered by silk and vavra  they have suggested that contrary to a straight linear relationship a jshaped relationship exists between positive reaction to an advertisement and its effectiveness and that the most effective advertising will be that which is either liked very much or disliked very much this could account for the effectiveness of disliked advertising while still maintaining a mediating role for attitudes toward the ad moore and hutchinson  also found a similar shaped response function after one week but noted that immediate response tended to be more linear most of the attempts to relate attitude toward the advertising and attitude toward the advertised brand seem to be following information processing theory lines lutz mackenzie and belch  for example have taken such a view in reporting a study aimed at uncovering the possible causal mediating role of affective reactions to advertising while finding a significant mediating role for attitudes toward advertising they seem less certain as to why offering several possible explanations among them the idea of mood shimp  also postulated a mediating role for attitude toward the ad proposing that it is linearly related to attitudes toward the advertised brand such that the more positive a receivers reactions are to specific advertising the more positive will be his reactions to the advertised product some of the most ambitious empirical work to date on this question comes from mitchell and his associates edell  gardner  mitchell  a b  mitchell and olson  the mitchell and olson  study looked at the effect of manipulating the content of advertising an analysis of brand attitude following fishbeins expectancyvalue formulation suggested that something other than the observed beliefs about the brand mediated the effect exposure to advertising had upon brand attitude factor analysis of the scales used uncovered a clear evaluative dimension in the measures used and this along with the brand attitude results from the expectancyvalue model reliably accounted for the observed difference in brand attitude mitchell and olson concluded from these findings that attitudes toward an advertisement could mediate the effects of emotional and visual advertising in the formation of brand attitude a methodological problem with the mitchell and olson study however mitigates its generality they used a latin square design for stimulus presentation such that each respondent saw all four advertisements thus consumer reactions to the ads seen earlier in this study probably influenced later reactions specifically seeing the verbal claim of softness may have sensitized respondents to it in other ads and in particular the ad portraying a kitten mitchell and olson apparently aware of this potential confounding problem had two other groups of respondents provide cognitive response protocols immediately after exposure to each of the ads they showed that when the verbal claim preceded the kitten advertisement about as many subjects mentioned softness in their protocols for the kitten advertisement as when the kitten advertisement preceded the verbal claim they concluded that  the kitten picture independently connoted the semantic concept of softness while this may be true the effects on consumer beliefs relative to softness the focus of the analysis remains undetermined it is reasonable to suspect that their findings were the result of contrast effects on beliefs that is exposure to all of the advertisements had a strong and significant effect on consumer beliefs relative to the softness of the alternative products mitchell  has suggested that attitude toward the brand and attitude toward the advertisement way in fact represent two different channels in the information acquisition process attitude toward the brand a verbal reaction to the product and attitude toward the advertisement a process that generates a node in memory that attaches to the memory trace of the advertising building upon this idea he now suggests  that attitudes toward the ad mediate visual and emotional effects and may represent primarily a nonverbal channel ray and batra batra and ray  ray and batra  have addressed the question of affect by combining information processing theory with the concept of involvement krugman  they suggest that high and low involvement advertising initiate different types of affective response in the case of high involvement affect is the result of extensive cognitive activity in the case of low involvement advertising affect is coupled with awareness zajoncs  mere exposure effects since few cognitive responses if any are created all of these prior studies have tended to avoid directly manipulating the type of advertising tactic being employed and therefore identifying the underlying response mechanisms which might apply with different executional formats yet there is a strong possibility that the type of execution will significantly influence both cognitive and affective evaluations of the brand as well as the advertising itself for example does the execution itself have specific influence over and above the beliefs associated with the product as a result of the advertising furthermore no attempt has been made as of yet to simultaneously investigate alternative advertising tactics along with differences in receiver response as might be present in users and nonusers of the product thus the primary purpose of this study will be to explore the underlying affective and cognitive mechanisms involved in endbenefit oriented versus product attributebased advertising as a rationale for current practice it would seem that in endbenefit type advertising affective reactions would have a greater impact in motivating purchase while in product attributebased advertising cognitive reactions would have the greater role a secondary purpose of this study will be to explore the effects of these alternative advertising tactics on different consumer segments analytic plan the analysis will be conducted in two phases first we will identify which campaigns did best and worst by usage segment and by diet behavior in our second phase we will probe the cognitive and affective response mechanisms underlying the performance of the different campaigns this will be done by developing a series or scales to quantity different underlying response mechanisms and then applying those scales to explain the differential responses to the various campaigns by different product usage segments method study design four finished second commercials for a recently introduced a food product with lower than the typical number of calories were created the product has been positioned as an appetizing product for weight conscious women the four commercials varied in their content ranging on a continuum from what was judged to be attributebased to endbenefit oriented in their promotional content specifically the commercials can be described as follows  commercial a significant emphasis on product appearance and attributes with eight closeup product beauty shots and no presenter  commercial b some emphasis on product appearance and attributes with three closeup product beauty shots and formal female presenter  commercial c minimal product emphasis with some emphasis on benefit to the consumer with four closeups of eyes and mouth of actress and three product beauty shots  commercial d significant emphasis on appearance of consumer with five closeups of beautiful body of actress two involving an admiring male and three product beauty shots in addition to the commercials print ads which mirrored the commercial copy were created five print ads were generated since it was of interest whether commercial c might be more effective with an endbenefit oriented print ad campaign or an attribute  based print campaign both of which were present to some degree in the commercial thus two ads compatible with the commercial content were created as companion print ads these campaigns were identified as the product attributebased print ad cpa and the endbenefit oriented print ad ceb each of the five campaigns was evaluated monadically subjects respondents were intercepted and interviewed in central location test facilities in five cities an equal number of respondents were assigned to each of the five treatment groups in each city a total of  respondents were interviewed  in each of the five treatment cells along with standard security questions respondents were screened for being female heads of households between the ages of  to  who had used products in that category in the past month quotas were set so that no more than  of the respondents were between the ages of  to  and onehalf of the respondents in each cell had bought the test product in the past and were positively disposed towards buying it again procedure after screening respondents were given a preexposure constant sum question and asked to identify the brands of products in the category anl quantity of each they will buy in their next  purchases packages they were then shown a test commercial told to watch it carefully and after exposure asked to rate it on an adjective checklist following this they were shown the print ad and asked to read it carefully this was followed by a five point purchase intent scale based only on both the commercial and print ad you just saw how likely would you be to buy test brand an interest question after having seen this advertising campaign would you say that your interest in buying test brand has increased decreased or remained the same a postexposure constant sue and questions about new information learned consistency of the advertising campaign with personal experience perceptions of any major advantages of the advertised brand and belief in overall superiority of the test brand over competition additional substantive questions followed these but since they are not relevant to our discussion they will not be presented here along with standard demographic questions respondents were asked if they were currently on a diet or watching their weight results treatment cell respondent homogeneity tests two chisquare tests were conducted to insure that the treatment cells for the five campaigns did not differ on the key demographic factors of age or diet behavior a chisquare test of age x campaign was observed to be nonstatistically significant x   df   p   similarly a chisquare test of diet behavior on a diet watching weight not on a diet x campaign was not statistically significant x   df   p   in order to test whether the five treatment cells were equivalent in terms of preexperimental usage of the test product a campaign x diet behavior x test product usage user nonuser three way anova was conducted with the dependent variable the preexposure number of test packages intending to purchase other than the expected main effect for product usage p   with users reporting significantly greater purchase interest than nonusers no other main effects or interactions were statistically significant while the mean scores for the diet behavior cells were in the expected direction on a diet  watching weight  not on a diet a significant main effect for diet behavior was observed only when the product usage variable was deleted from the analysis campaign performance a series of six threeway novas were conducted with the independent variables product usage diet behavior and campaign and the dependent variables new information learned consistency with personal experience major advantage citations for the advertised product belief in the overall superiority of the advertised product purchase intent and the difference in post and pre purchases in the constant sum question all posthoc tests were conducted using the tukey hsd procedure the purpose of these tests were to determine if the five campaigns varied in their ability to generate different responses relating to information acquisition perceptions of personal experiences and motivation major advantage citations overall superiority belief and intended purchases among the different market segments learn new information statistically significant main effects were observed for product usage p   and campaign p   more information was learned by nonusers than by users p   and by respondents in the two most extreme product attributebased campaigns a and b than in the two most endbenefit oriented campaigns ceb and d p   the intermediate product attributebased campaign cpa also scored significantly higher than its complementary endbenefit oriented campaign ceb p   consistency with personal experience a statistically significant main effect for product usage p   and a product usage by campaign interaction p   were observed the source of the interaction was that while on an overall basis users reported significantly greater consistency than nonusers p   users found campaign a consistent with their experience and nonusers found it inconsistent with their experience at levels far greater than any other campaign and in campaign ceb users and nonusers did not differ at statistically significant levels major advantage statistically significant main effects were observed for product usage p  and for campaign p   significantly more users than nonusers cited major advantages for the test product p   with respect to the campaigns more major advantages were cited in the most product attributebased campaign a than in either of the two most endbenefit oriented campaigns ceb and d overall superiority statistically significant main effects were observed for product usage p   diet behavior p   and marginally for campaign p   users rated the test brand higher in overall superiority and those on a diet rated it significantly better than respondents either watching their weight or not dieting p   as in the case of major advantage citation the product attributebased campaign a out performed either of the two most endbenefit oriented campaigns ceb and d p   purchase intent all three variables had statistically significant main effects predictably users were significantly higher in purchase intent than nonusers p   and respondents on a diet or watching their weight had significantly higher purchase intent than nondieters p   higher purchase interest was observed for all three product attributebased campaigns a b and cpa than for the two endbenefit oriented campaigns ceb and d p   prepost constant sum as is often the case with constant sum measures because of ceiling effects with users significantly more intended purchases were stated by nonusers than by users p   a statistically significant campaign main effect p   was the result of the two most extreme product attributebased campaigns a and b having significantly greater shifts in intended purchases than the two most extreme endbenefit oriented campaigns p   a marginally statistically significant product usage by diet behavior interaction p   was the result of nondieters showing no statistically significant difference between users and nonusers p   while among those respondents watching their weight nonusers showed a significantly greater shift than users p   in fact respondents who were watching their weight and were test brand users allowed a significantly smaller shift than any nonuser segment p   scale development while it has just been demonstrated that the product attributebased campaign clearly outperformed the endbenefit oriented campaigns and that diet behavior significantly affected consumer reactions to all of the campaigns the different mechanisms which might be underlying consumer response to the four commercials has yet to be identified as such one way anovas were conducted on all  adjectives of the adjective checklist in each case the independent variable was the four commercials and the dependent variable was purchase intent fifteen  adjectives were selected as showing discrimination among the four commercials p   a principle components factor analysis with a varimax rotation of these adjectives was conducted three factors were identified using as a criterion an eigenvalue cutoff of  or higher inclusion of a fourth factor did not seem defensible on either statistical there was a sharp dropoff between three and four factors in variance accounted for or logical grounds table  shows the three factors each factor was considered a scale and a reliability analysis indicated alpha levels of   and  for the three scales respectively table  derived response scales the three scales seemed to reflect three types of response structures  affective positive cognitive negative and cognitive positive it remains to be determined how the commercials differed in terms of these response mechanisms our prediction is that the product attributebased campaigns would significantly outperform the endbenefit oriented campaigns on the cognitive positive measure with the reverse true for the cognitive negative and affective positive measures campaign differentiation in terms of response mechanisms three anovas were conducted in each one of the three response scales was the dependent variable and the independent variables were as before product usage diet behavior and campaign in the three way anova on the affective positive scale the only statistically significant effect was the main effect for campaign p   the strongest endbenefit oriented campaign d was rated higher than the product attributebased campaign b p  although not quite statistically significant as would be predicted campaign d also was rated higher than campaign in the anova on the cognitive negative scale there were two statistically significant effects the main effects for product usage where nonusers had more cognitive negative responses than users p   and for campaign in the case of the latter effect campaign d had significantly more cognitive negative ratings than campaigns a or b campaign c it might be noted was positioned right where predicted between d and campaigns a and b the anova on the cognitive positive scale produced two statistically significant effects a product usage main effect and a campaign main effect and one marginally significant main effect for diet behavior users were observed to rate the commercials higher than nonusers p   and the most product oriented campaign a produced more positive associations than the most endbenefit oriented campaign d p   it might be noted once again that the intermediate campaigns b and c fell in the predicted order that is b had the most cognitive positive associations after a regression modeling of advertising response up until now we have demonstrated that the campaigns had different impacts upon the target market and that these effects seemed to relate to the underlying cognitive and affective responses to the advertising stimuli we now turn to the questions of  whether these cognitive and affective responses make an independent contribution to the overall purchase motivation over and above that accounted for by background variables age income product usage and diet behavior and  whether the nature of the mechanisms underlying these responses differ bs usage category table  shows the results of a series of multiple regression models these models are tied together by a conceptual framework which suggests that cognitive responses are more important in determining purchase interest to current product users and the most susceptible nonusers while affective responses are of primary importance to hard core nonusers models i and ii are based on the total sample model ii includes model i and demonstrates that inclusion of the affective and cognitive responses greatly increases the amount of variance accounted for by the models an f test showed that model ii is a significant improvement over the strictly background model i f   df   p   it might be also noted that in terms of magnitude each of the beta weights for the two cognitive measures accounts for more than four times the explained variance than does the affective measure table  multiple regression models of purchase intent the high beta value for the number of prepackages and our prior anova results suggested to us that users and nonusers might be responding differentially to the different campaigns a chow test see appendix a clearly demonstrated this to be true f   df   p   the user and nonuser models are shown as models iii and iv respectively interestingly only cognitive response levels were statistically significant among users while both cognitive and affective responses were statistically significant among nonusers in fact for nonusers the beta weights for both cognitive response and the affective response levels were now about equal suggesting that all three contribute about equally in motivating purchase intent one further segmentation of the data is of interest although sample size limitations prevent conducting conclusive tests we divided the nonuser sample base   on the basis of their diet behavior one group was defined as susceptibles base   and included respondents categorized as on a diet or watching their weight the second group was defined as nonsusceptibles base   on the basis of their not being on a diet or watching their weight models v susceptibles and vi nonsusceptibles suggest that the underlying response mechanisms of these two groups differ susceptibles seem to be motivated by cognitive response mechanisms while nonsusceptibles are motivated by the affective mechanisms figure  summarizes these effects figure  summary of response mechanisms underlying purchase intent lastly additional multiple regression analyses not reported here tue to space limitations incorporated a dummy variable in order to determine the impact of the print ad and any of the other nonresponse mechanism based background variance in the different cells the underlying cognitive and affective response scales were found to maintain their statistical significance even with this additional background variable conclusions our results showed that the attributebased campaigns outperformed the endbenefit oriented campaigns and that diet behavior predisposed the respondents towards more positive reactions to all of the campaigns pursuing our interest in the process underlying these findings we developed a series of scales which showed that the campaigns did in fact vary on the hypothesized cognitive and affective dimensions the better performing product attributebased campaign commercials scored higher on the cognitive positive dimension and the lower scoring endbenefit commercials scored higher on the cognitive negative and affective positive dimensions our final analysis explored the nature of the relationship between these underlying response dimensions and purchase interest it was shown that these cognitive and affective reactions contributed toward purchase interest in the test product over and above the effects attributable to demographic current product usage and predispositional diet behavior variables furthermore it was found that users and nonusers differed in the relationship of their cognitive and affective responses to purchase interest nonusers relied more zn affective reactions a further segmentation of the nonuser group identified two subgroups which differed in their responses  a susceptibles nonuser subgroup those with a positive predisposition toward product purchase as evidenced by their engaging in some form of diet behavior who showed significant relationships with purchase interest only for cognitive responses and  a nonsusceptibles nonuser subgroup who showed significant relationships with purchase interest only for affective responses two conclusions seem to be suggested by these findings first advertising campaign tactics can be differentiated along underlying consumer response dimensions and these can be expected to include both cognitive and affective reactions to the advertising itself second cognitive responses as defined in table  appear to be more important in motivating current product users or hose nonusers predisposed to usage while affective responses are more important among the least predisposed nonusers it is tempting to describe this differentiaion as suggesting that rational arguments are needed to persuade those respondents predisposed toward purchase while affective reactions are needed to motivate those lot predisposed if nonusage but responsiveness to the advertising message is viewed as low product involvement then the results of this study are consistent with that body of literature low involvement is theorized to result in few cognitive responses and unchanged attitudes it is perceived as creating advertising awareness and precognitive affect here however awareness was conrolled in the sense of the advertising being presented in a forced exposure format and even in this environment cognitive responses were minimized thus affective responses may be more important in low involvement advertising independent of mere exposure driven awareness high involvement is theorized as generating significant cognitive activity corresponding to the responses observed here among users and those predisposed toward purchase it was found that the product attributebased campaign outperformed the endbenefit oriented campaign this may have been the result of high consumer familiarity with the end benefit of the tested product with a new product one where product attributes are not often advertised or a different product classcategory the endbenefit oriented approach might prove to be superior in any case the confounding effects of endbenefit campaigns tending to be affect oriented and productbased attribute campaigns tending to rely on cognitive mechanisms would require separation in future studies in order to provide a clear understanding of what works best in any given situation appendix chow test references bartos r  do we really have to make them mad to sell them paper presented at the th annual
