uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and accordingly such results may differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made herein these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those relating to competitive industry conditions california tourism and weather conditions dependence on existing management leverage and debt service the regulation of the recreational vehicle industry domestic or global economic conditions and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws overview  the company continues to promote and depend upon recreational vehicle camping as the primary source of revenue the rental of campsites to the general public provides income to cover expenses complete capital improvements and allow shareholders up to fortyfive free nights camping annually additional revenues come from rv storage and spotting rv service and repair onsite convenience store and other ancillary activities such as laundromat arcade and bike rental the company has been fortunate not to have significant impact due to the current economy the rving public actively seeks accommodations on the central coast despite volatile fuel prices and personal financial uncertainties rving offers an affordable outdoor recreational experience and the company provides quality facilities and services in a highly popular location total site occupancy is down  compared to this time last year due to spring weather conditions and the current economy occupancy projections look equal to last year throughout the remainder of the fiscal year revenues from ancillary operations such as the store arcade laundromat and bike rental are flat to slightly down yeartodate and management feels this is directly related to the economy and this trend will continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year rv storage continues to be a major source of income for the company demand is strong as the new storage property is accepting new customers rv storage provides numerous benefits to the customer including no stress of towing no need to own a tow vehicle use of rv by multiple family members and convenience      after years with no debt the board of directors approved expansion of the rv storage program and understood this investment would require substantial financing management has made it a high priority to effect timely construction and successful marketing in order to maximize return on this investment ongoing investment in resort improvements has assured resort guests and shareholders a top quality uptodate facility this quality and pride of ownership was evident when the national association of rv parks and campgrounds park of the year was awarded to the resort for  in addition in  the resort was the only industry rated a park in california for customer satisfaction the companys commitment to quality value and enjoyment is underscored by the businesss success due to word of mouth and referrals from guests in addition investment for online marketing ads in the two leading national directories and trade magazine advertising formulates most of the business marketing plan results of operations  the company develops its income from two sources a resort operations consisting of revenues generated from rv site rentals from rv storage space operations and from lease revenues from laundry and arcade operations by third party lessees and b retail operations consisting of revenues from general store operations and from rv parts and service operations income from resort operations for the threemonth period ended june   decreased  or  below the same period in  resort income for the nine months ended june   decreased  or  from the same period ended june   this decrease in the quarter ending june   is due primarily to a  decrease in paid site occupancy and therefore a  or  decrease in site rental revenue the decrease in resort operations income for the ninemonth period reflects decreases in site rental of  storage and spotting of  and recreation of  management feels these decreases in revenue reflect the current economy and year to date decrease in paid site occupancy of  seasonal fluctuations within this industry are expected and management projects that income for the fourth quarter will be approximately  of its annual revenue this approximation is based on historical information      income from retail operations for the threemonth period ended june   decreased  or  below the same period in  the general store decreased revenue by  or  and rv service revenue increased  or  decreased income in the general store reflects the business due to decreased site occupancy and the current economy the rv service business is accessible to the public and fortunate to not be dependant upon the resorts occupancy income from retail operations for the ninemonth period ending june   decreased by  or  below the same period ended june   this reflects a  or  decrease in general store income and a  or increase in rv service income management feels this decrease in revenue from retail operations is a symptom of the economy and customers reluctance to spend the company anticipates similar activity in both income from resort operations and retail operations through the remainder of fiscal year  operating expenses for the quarter ended june   decreased  or  from the same period in  this decrease in expense is primarily a result of managements effort to reduce labor operating expenses for the ninemonth period ended june   increased  or  from the same period in  this increase is primarily due to labor and labor related expenses property taxes utilities custodial supplies and vehicle expense cost of goods sold for  are within projected levels at  of retail sales for the quarter and  yeartodate cost of goods sold for  were  and  respectively interest expense for the threemonth and ninemonth periods ended june   is  and  respectively compared to  and  the previous year this expense reflects the financing due to acquiring new rv storage properties which closed escrow january   april   and may   net income for the quarter ending june   decreased by  or  compared with the same period ending june   this quarterly decrease in net income is primarily due to decreased income in resort and retail operations and increased cost of goods and depreciation net income for the nine months ending june  decreased by  or  compared with the same period ending june   this decrease in net income is a result of decreased resort and retail income an increase in operating expenses cost of goods and depreciation the last quarter of  is expected to provide adequate resources for continuing business and provide for planned capital expenditures      management has introduced various marketing promotions with reduced rates to increase revenues during low occupancy periods however due to the nature of business and economic cycles and trends rates may be adjusted accordingly if deemed necessary although the supplydemand balance generally remains favorable future operating results could be adversely impacted by weak demand this condition could limit the companys ability to pass through inflationary increases in operating costs as higher rates increases in transportation and fuel costs or sustained recessionary periods could also unfavorably impact future results however the company believes that its financial strength and market presence will enable it to remain extremely competitive liquidity  the company planned capital expenditures of approximately  in fiscal year  to further enhance the resort facilities and services projects include development of rv storage property for  units road paving resort wifi upgrade and new trailer tow vehicle road paving was postponed until fiscal year  and the other projects were completed at a year todate cost of  funding for these projects is expected to be from normal operating cash flows and if necessary supplemented with outside financing these capital expenditures are expected to increase the resorts value to its shareholders and the general public due to the success of the companys rv storage program and the fact that the storage lots have operated at full capacity the board of directors elected to purchase additional property on january   the company closed escrow on a acre property already developed as an rv storage facility the purchase price was  million and included approximately  existing storage customers on april   the company purchased a  acre property the company had been renting and using as rv storage the purchase price for this property was  funding for these acquisitions was obtained through a local lending institution on may   the company closed escrow on a  acre property in arroyo grande to be developed for rv storage the purchase price was  for the undeveloped land and permanent financing was secured from santa lucia bank this property began taking new storage units in may of  the company understands the demand for rv storage and feels offering rv storage compliments the primary business of renting campsites      the companys current cash position as of june   is  which is  less than the previous year this decrease in cash reflects less net income due to lower occupancy and less retail revenue the present level of cash is being maintained in anticipation of large capital expenditures capital projects are designed to enhance the marketability of the camping sites and enhance support facilities recognizing the age of the resort and increased demands resulting from modern recreational vehicles the board has directed management to provide plans to update and improve accommodations of the resort future renovation would include new utilities larger sites improved site access new restroom facilities and additional amenities accounts receivable for the period ending june   increased  above june   and reflects additional business from new storage customers rental deposits increased  or  compared to the same period last year due to site rental rate increases effective october   accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased  to an amount of  for june   compared to the same period ending  this increase was primarily due to timing of payment of monthly liabilities all undisputed payables have been paid in full according to the companys policy the company has consistently demonstrated an ability to optimize revenues developed from resort and retail operations during the summer season during other less revenue producing periods rv storage space and site rentals are paid for in advance and used for resort improvements and cash reserves the company has a revolving line of credit for  to augment operating or capital expenditure cash needs during off season periods the company considers its financial position sufficient to meet its anticipated future financial requirements the

off  off and  off ads generally refer to discounts off the highestpriced mostrestricted ticket classes refundable etc what the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets news flash in most cases theyre providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances heres the bottom line most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest mostrestricted tickets those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime with lowcost airlines online travel agents and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting its rare that youd ever pay the highest possible price anyway so that  off discount doesnt apply to any flight youre likely to book for the best strategy search flights from a wide variety of providers comparing rates is the only way to ensure youre getting a competitive price its the closest thing youve got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights here are our top tips most domestic airlines release sales on tuesdays with the majority of competitors matching these deals within  hours to take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from search for fares on tuesdays and wednesdays historically saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel when heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports be sure to check them all to ensure youre getting the best fare for example if youre flying to new york city search for the major airports jfk laguardia and newark as well as smaller options long islandislip and white plains be flexible with your dates searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare search then search again frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time eg once or twice per day over a week or two gives you an indepth realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be then when you see a price you think is fair book with confidence knowing youve locked in the best fare for your route and budget bookingbuddy allows you to search various partner sites at

rules and regulations before booking get the scoop heres the truth about those  off hotel deals you may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms though it got your attention the deals unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny here we detail why that discount is likely subtracted from the rooms rack rate the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season since its unlikely that youll ever be charged that price the discount isnt really a discount at all advertisers also like to add extras to the room rate to artificially inflate that  off and sometimes even  off claim this value often includes daily breakfast internet access and other surchargecarrying services in the nightly rate the discount therefore isnt based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you hotel rates are constantly changing if an event is coming to town room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium conversely if there are extended periods of lower vacancy hurricane season in the caribbean for example room prices plummet attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is at best an inexact science here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time dont only check one site and call it a day by comparing prices across several providers major online travel agencies and your favorite hotel brands site you may find that one price point undercuts the restor offers a little something extra for the same price go for it go opaque youll see
