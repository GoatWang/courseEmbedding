atomically they also have very specific physical properties and are formed through biogeochemical processes though they may look like rocks to the untrained eye minerals differ from rocks substantially in that they have only one specific chemical composition while rocks are a mix of many kinds of minerals or mineraloids  some of the many chemical compositions minerals can have ordered approximately by their abundance in the earths crust from highest to lowest include the silicate class the carbonate class the sulfate class the halide class the oxide class the sulfide class the phosphate class the element class and the organic class minerals are a critical commodity to many industries following their mining and processing and form a material input to chemicals manufacturing metallurgy building materials manufacturing electrical grid infrastructure electronics glass products vehicles and hightechnology rare earth minerals or rare earth elements are particularly crucial to numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies common oxide minerals include chromite hematite and magnetite economically minerals from the sulfide class are arguably just as valuable as metal ores and include chalcopyrite or copper iron sulfide galena or lead sulfide and pentlandite or nickel iron sulfide the element class is home to those minerals called native metals or intermetallic elements such as gold silver and copper as well as natural alloys the element class is also where one could find semimetals and nonmetals such as bismuth graphite and sulfur sort by

spanish english what are graphite electrodesprocesschoosingshippingtechnical servicesvalue added servicespatentsdownloads what is a graphite electrode graphite electrodes are used almost exclusively within the electric arc furnace of a steel mill so to understand a graphite electrode first you must understand what an electric arc furnace is ok what is an electric arc furnace an electric arc furnace is essentially a big recycling machine simply put it’s a large pot into which scrap steel like old cars bicycles and refrigerators are dumped the furnace operator loads called charging the furnace carefully screened and selected scrap steel into this big pot then the operator swings the furnace lid back over the pot and lowers it into place the electrodes are part of the furnace roof structure electrodes can be small  millimeters  inches in diameter or quite large up to  millimeters  inches in diameter and as much as  millimeters long the largest weigh more than two metric tons  lbs the manufacturer of the furnace determines the size the electrode should be the electrodes are assembled into columns usually  to a column graphite connecting pinstapered and threaded on each end screw two electrodes together some furnace operators assemble the columns on the shop floor and lift them into place whole others add electrodes one at a time to the top of the column while it is still on the furnace each electrode column has a large steel arm which moves it up and down furnaces using phase ac alternating current electricity have  electrode columns dc direct current furnaces only need one column of electrodes but they are generally larger in diameter once the furnace lid is in place the electrodes are lowered until the tip of the electrode column almost touches the top of the scrap steel huge amounts of electricity–large furnaces use enough electricity for a town of  people–flow through large watercooled cables into the electrodes at the bottom of the electrode column the electricity jumps or arcs from the electrode tip to the nearest piece of scrap steel the intense heat of this electric arc melts the scrap steel hence the name of the electric arc furnace the tip of the electrode will reach  degrees celsius or  degrees fahrenheit half the temperature of the surface of the sun electrodes are made of graphite because only graphite can withstand this incredible temperature eventually all the steel is melted the furnace operator turns off the power and raises the electrode columns the furnace is then tipped on its side to pour the molten steel into giant buckets called ladles the ladles quickly carry the molten steel to the steel mill’s caster which is the next step in making new and useful products from recycled scrap steel to answer the question then what is a graphite electrode a graphite electrode is a device to conduct electricity down into an electric arc furnace which generates sufficient heat to melt scrap steel for more information be sure to look through our new graphite electrodes brochure making a ucar® graphite electrode mill mix  forming premium quality calcined coke is crushed screened and hotblended with pitch in controlled proportions the resulting plastic mass is extruded through a forming press and cut into specified lengths before being watercooled in a temperature controlled bath baking green electrodes are placed in large cans called saggers pronounced say gers and baked to over ° c ° f in specially designed computercontrolled furnaces it takes to weeks to carbonize the pitch depending upon the size of the electrodes being made after cooling the carbon electrodes are cleaned inspected and sampletested impregnation next the baked electrodes are impregnated with a special pitch to give them the higher density mechanical strength and electrical conductivity they will need to withstand the severe operating conditions inside our customers’ electric arc furnaces rebake a second baking cycle or “rebake” is required to carbonize the pitch impregnation and to drive off any remaining volatiles rebake temperatures reach almost °c ° f graphitizing the rebaked carbon electrodes are further processed in long electric resistance furnaces laid endtoend or “longitudinally” the electrodes are heated to over ° c ° f this ultra high temperature restructures the carbon to its crystalline form—graphite then the electrodes are once again cooled cleaned inspected and sampletested under graftech’s rigorous control procedures machining in machining the electrodes outer dimension are turned to its finished dimension the two end faces are also machined to tolerance and given threaded sockets the sockets accept graftech’s doubletapered machinethreaded graphite connecting pins which allow our customers to join electrodes together into columns shipping after machining the finished graphite electrodes are inspected protectively capped and palletized each electrode prominently displays the graftech™ ucar®

what is a graphite electrode graphite electrodes are used almost exclusively within the electric arc furnace of a steel mill so to understand a graphite electrode first you must understand what an electric arc furnace is ok what is an electric arc furnace an electric arc furnace is essentially a big recycling machine simply put it’s a large pot into which scrap steel like old cars bicycles and refrigerators are dumped the furnace operator loads called charging the furnace carefully screened and selected scrap steel into this big pot then the operator swings the furnace lid back over the pot and lowers it into place the electrodes are part of the furnace roof structure electrodes can be small  millimeters  inches in diameter or quite large up to  millimeters  inches in diameter and as much as  millimeters long the largest weigh more than two metric tons  lbs the manufacturer of the furnace determines the size the electrode should be the electrodes are assembled into columns usually  to a column graphite connecting pinstapered and threaded on each end screw two electrodes together some furnace operators assemble the columns on the shop floor and lift them into place whole others add electrodes one at a time to the top of the column while it is still on the furnace each electrode column has a large steel arm which moves it up and down furnaces using phase ac alternating current electricity have  electrode columns dc direct current furnaces only need one column of electrodes but they are generally larger in diameter once the furnace lid is in place the electrodes are lowered until the tip of the electrode column almost touches the top of the scrap steel huge amounts of electricity–large furnaces use enough electricity for a town of  people–flow through large watercooled cables into the electrodes at the bottom of the electrode column the electricity jumps or arcs from the electrode tip to the nearest piece of scrap steel the intense heat of this electric arc melts the scrap steel hence the name of the electric arc furnace the tip of the electrode will reach  degrees celsius or  degrees fahrenheit half the temperature of the surface of the sun electrodes are made of graphite because only graphite can withstand this incredible temperature eventually all the steel is melted the furnace operator turns off the power and raises the electrode columns the furnace is then tipped on its side to pour the molten steel into giant buckets called ladles the ladles quickly carry the molten steel to the steel mill’s caster which is the next step in making new and useful products from recycled scrap steel to answer the question then what is a graphite electrode a graphite electrode is a device to conduct electricity down into an electric arc furnace which generates sufficient heat to melt scrap steel for more information be sure to look through our new graphite electrodes brochure making a ucar® graphite electrode mill mix  forming premium quality calcined coke is crushed screened and hotblended with pitch in controlled proportions the resulting plastic mass is extruded through a forming press and cut into specified lengths before being watercooled in a temperature controlled bath baking green electrodes are placed in large cans called saggers pronounced say gers and baked to over ° c ° f in specially designed computercontrolled furnaces it takes to weeks to carbonize the pitch depending upon the size of the electrodes being made after cooling the carbon electrodes are cleaned inspected and sampletested impregnation next the baked electrodes are impregnated with a special pitch to give them the higher density mechanical strength and electrical conductivity they will need to withstand the severe operating conditions inside our customers’ electric arc furnaces rebake a second baking cycle or “rebake” is required to carbonize the pitch impregnation and to drive off any remaining volatiles rebake temperatures reach almost °c ° f graphitizing the rebaked carbon electrodes are further processed in long electric resistance furnaces laid endtoend or “longitudinally” the electrodes are heated to over ° c ° f this ultra high temperature restructures the carbon to its crystalline form—graphite then the electrodes are once again cooled cleaned inspected and sampletested under graftech’s rigorous control procedures machining in machining the electrodes outer dimension are turned to its finished dimension the two end faces are also machined to tolerance and given threaded sockets the sockets accept graftech’s doubletapered machinethreaded graphite connecting pins which allow our customers to join electrodes together into columns shipping after machining the finished graphite electrodes are inspected protectively capped and palletized each electrode prominently displays the graftech™ ucar® graphite electrode logo as it is sent on its way to our customers selecting the proper ucar® electrode grade ucar® grade agx™ graphite electrode – a premium grade recommended for high power ultrahigh power and dc furnaces operating under severe electrical andor mechanical conditions agx is graphite electrodes are also recommended for ladle furnace applications because of its increased currentcarrying capacity ucar® grade alx™ graphite electrode – a unique grade addressing applications where stub losses and column breakage is an issue ucar® grade lfx™ graphite electrode – a premium grade recommended for ladle furnaces or for lowpower melting applications where standard electrodes fail to perform the charts on this page for melting furnaces and ladle furnaces are based on the heating effect in a graphite electrode column by applying an assumed average phase current typical current carrying ranges size  grade selection to properly select the right ucar® graphite electrode for your application always consider the following operating characteristics
