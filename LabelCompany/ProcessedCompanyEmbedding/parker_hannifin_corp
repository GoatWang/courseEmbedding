environments improved high temperature resilience makes ff a prime candidate for applications in aerospace heavy duty mobile chemical processing and semiconductor industries where temperatures typically exceed °f ff also offers excellent hot water and steam resistance and is a more cost effective solution when compared to other ffkm materials one of the biggest sealing challenges in mechanical seal applications is a requirement for low breakout friction in order to accomplish this orings are designed with very low squeeze and as such there is a risk of leakage due to compression set says tyler yonker territory sales engineer engineered materials group ff shows significant improvement with low compression set values when tested side by side against current ffkm materials this material extends the life of mechanical seals without increasing the cost of the orings ff is available in custom molded extruded spliced oring or lathe cut products watch for the upcoming industry
