with that i will turn the call over to rob robert v vitale  post holdings inc thanks brad and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results we previewed these results when we announced our weetabix acquisition this morning jeff and i will go into detail on the quarter and provide some information on how we intend to integrate and report weetabix our second quarter results were in line with our expectations as michael foods group adjusted ebitda declined materially and was largely but not entirely offset by growth in each of our other segments in general this year is shaping up as expected with our cereal business moving into the final stages of the post foodsmom brands integration our valueadded egg business cycling over extraordinary comparisons our protein business experiencing abovemarket growth and our private brands business generating steady performance after a brief operational slip more specifically with respect to each segment post consumer brands continues to execute on synergy opportunities and to build upon market momentum this quarter we continue to take actions to optimize our production and distribution network and we expect to implement plans throughout the year our initial network optimization effort resulting from the postmom merger will be completed early next year additional opportunities resulting from weetabix will develop over a longer timeframe as always we remain focused on continuous cost reduction across the organization recently cereal category trends have worsened this quarter the category declined  in dollars and  in pounds a more segmented analysis shows that in comparison to category averages declines are most pronounced in the adult brands about average in allfamily brands the kid cereal is growing in pounds with dollars flat our consumption performance was strong with dollars increasing  and pounds increasing  we grew both base and incremental consumption post dollar and pound share increased  and  respectively performance benefited from a promotional plan more heavily weighted to the first half of fiscal  on a full year basis we anticipate fiscal  trade levels to be comparable with  pebbles and maltomeal bags each had a great quarter pebbles grew pound consumption  driven by strong base turns and maltomeal bags grew  driven by additional items on shelf honey bunches of oats consumption was pressured by distribution losses but incremental pound consumption grew  resulting from increased merchandising support great grains consumption comparison remains negatively impacted by products discontinued in  our fourth quarter will be the first fully comparable period however core great grains consumption performance was soft this quarter with modest gains in base consumption performance offset by incremental losses michael foods performed as expected this quarter we continue to expect to lap the impact of avian influenza during the second half of fiscal  recall we planned for a reduction in the michael foods group ebitda resulting from an aidriven imbalance of oversupply of grainbased eggs versus grainbased demand essentially we are selling higher cost in grainbased eggs at persistently low market prices we now estimate the decline in this segments ebitda at the high side of our previous range of  million to  million which has been factored into our guidance active nutrition continues to show great growth driven by premier protein shakes and bars the premier protein brand is driving category growth and we continue to see great potential for the brand powerbar continues to be weighed down by distribution losses dymatize has stabilized however the specialty channel continues to be weak within private brands second quarter results are burdened by comanufacturer expenses we expect it to be able to insource granola manufacturing for which we had undertaken a capacity expansion we experienced a small fire that will delay the new capacity coming online until next fiscal year at our nut butter and dried fruit and nut businesses we have moved to address inefficiencies including eliminating unprofitable skus were also narrowing our focus to less complex product solutions before turning the call over to jeff i want to preview some organizational changes and discuss our value creating algorithm we are quite optimistic about our pending acquisition of weetabix it diversifies our portfolio with a leading iconic uk brand in one of our core categories it expands our presence in the worlds second largest active nutrition market it is the leading producer of organic and nongmo readytoeat cereal products in north america it creates optionality for us in the uk and in europe to grow organically and through ma upon closing the weetabix transaction weetabix uk and ireland will be a standalone business within our portfolio and weetabixs north american operations will be combined into post consumer brands additionally its the right time to bring all our cereal brands under one unit with this in mind we will also move the attune foods cereal and granola business into post consumer brands attune and weetabix north america are both tightly focused on the health and wellness segment of readytoeat cereal this will allow each business to share best practices manage costs on a combined basis and leverage the capabilities and strengths of the combined business beyond the uk and north america the weetabix acquisition creates holding company wide scale in certain international markets in these key markets we will create a consolidated presence to support resources in each market in closing i want to review our valuecreation algorithm including weetabix we expect to consistently add  to  to our ebitda and generate cash flow in excess of  million the impact of ebitda growth and debt reduction produces a midteens longterm rate of growth and equity value at a constant multiple moreover we hope to allocate capital to more attractive purposes than debt reduction over time we will tend to invest in larger slowergrowing companies and smaller fastergrowing companies in this manner we can maintain both the capacity to leverage our cash flow and the potential to grow it with weetabix we will acquire a slow growth business with synergies and enormous amount of optionality we will finance it without incremental equity in fact we are increasing our leverage and reducing our cost of capital the transformative diversification of our cash flow including weetabix produces this outcome and enables us to continue seeking attractive investment opportunities with that i will turn the call over to jeff jeff a zadoks  post holdings inc thanks rob and good morning everyone second quarter performance was in line with our expectations with consolidated net sales of  billion and adjusted ebitda of  million turning to our segment results and beginning with post consumer brands net sales were  million a decline of  compared to the prior year total volumes declined  resulting from decreases in lower margin comanufacturing and governmentbid business however product mix improved with strong sales volume increases for two of our four core brands maltomeal bags and pebbles volumes for our other core brands honey bunches of oats and great grains experienced declines this primarily resulted from lapping the prior year honey bunches of oats club promotion that did not repeat and the exit of certain discontinued great grains skus as we move into the third quarter we have now fully lapped the reduced comanufacturing volumes and we will lap the discontinued great grains skus in our fourth quarter however we will not lap the reduced governmentbid business volumes until the end of the fiscal year post consumer brands adjusted ebitda was approximately  million for the quarter and benefited from manufacturing cost savings improved product mix and reduced consumer advertising and promotion this was partially offset by a higher trade promotion rate the trade promotion rate for the second quarter was in line with the first quarter rate we continue to expect lower promotional spend in the second half of the year based on the timing of our promotional activities michael foods group net sales were  million a decline of  on a pro forma basis egg volumes increased  also on a pro forma basis we continue to see delays in customers returning to valueadded egg products with the ongoing low market prices for shell eggs this contributes to the imbalance rob mentioned earlier egg revenues decreased  as we continue to lap the impact of avian influenza pricing we also continued to experience lower pricing to our marketbased customers in line with urner barry market prices as with the first quarter cheese volumes declined significantly resulting from the eggs at a certain low margin private label business in the fourth quarter of fiscal  this quarter we also experienced branded cheese distribution losses and we saw general weakness in the cheese demand michael foods group adjusted ebitda was  million and well below the comparable prior year period as we continue to progress through the egg market recovery from ai recall we anticipated our second quarter yearoveryear adjusted ebitda performance gap in this segment would be greater than in the first quarter and that turned out to be the case we continue to expect the yearoveryear performance gap to shrink during our third and fourth quarters when compared to the second quarter moving to active nutrition net sales were  million an increase of  compared to the prior year growth in premier protein shakes and bars was partially offset by declines for powerbar dymatize branded net sales were up  from higher volumes partially offset by increased trade spend resulting from lapping unusually low trade rates in the prioryear period active nutrition adjusted ebitda was  million and benefited from higher premier protein volumes and lower raw material cost this was partially offset by increased advertising and promotional spend across all three brands recall the quarterly margins in this segment fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of promotional activity and levels of consumer marketing spending we saw higher trade and marketing levels in the second quarter and expect this to repeat in the fourth quarter we continue to expect fiscal  annual adjusted ebitda margins in this segment to be in the mid to high teens turning to private brands net sales were  million an increase of  compared to the prior year revenue benefited from growth in volumes of higher margin tree nut butters and organic peanut butter sales revenues were negatively impacted by volume declines for dried fruit and nut and lower net pricing for almond and walnut products related to pass through of declining input costs private brands adjusted ebitda was  million and benefited from the favorable nut butter product mix this was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies in dried fruit and nut and comanufacturing costs in the granola business before reviewing our guidance i would like to comment on our operating cash flows and capital market transactions our cash flow from operations for the first six months of fiscal  was significantly lower than the comparable prior year period current year cash flow was negatively impacted by three items first we paid  million in legal settlements related to egg antitrust lawsuits second earlier in the fiscal year we paid abovetarget bonuses that resulted from strong performance last year finally we experienced an increase in working capital which was mostly driven by timing we expect the operating cash flow in the second half of fiscal  to be considerably higher than the first half as a result of modestly improved operating performance and the absence of the aforementioned items in fact in april alone we generated approximately  million of cash moving to our capital market transactions in midfebruary we opportunistically refinanced and extended the maturities for a portion of our fixed rate bonds by issuing  billion of  senior notes due in  and  million of  senior notes due in  these proceeds were used in part to fund redemptions in march of all of our outstanding  senior notes due in  and  senior notes due in  for the aggregate principal that was redeemed we achieved  million of annual reduction in our interest cost in march we amended and restated our credit agreement in doing so we extended its term to march of  increased the size of our revolver to  million  lowered the cost of borrowing under the facility and created greater flexibility within the covenants yesterday we announced that we intend to raise approximately  billion in term loan debt we anticipate using these funds for both the acquisition of weetabix and our tender offers for our  senior notes due in  and  senior notes due in  giving full credit for the second quarter and upcoming capital market transactions and the weetabix acquisition we expect pro forma net leverage as measured by our credit facility to be approximately  times and our quarterly net interest expense to be approximately  million at this net leverage level we continue to have flexibility to pursue new ma opportunities including with our outlook we continue to expect fiscal  adjusted ebitda to range between  million and  million excluding any contribution from weetabix with that i would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions operator questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of john baumgartner of wells fargo john joseph baumgartner  wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thanks for the question robert v vitale  post holdings inc good morning john john joseph baumgartner  wells fargo securities llc rob id like to ask at the michael business what are your thoughts as to why demand has been so slow to respond there i mean i have to think that on a price basis eggs really have to offer quite significant value relative to the proteins for the endcustomers how do you really explain the demand softness robert v vitale  post holdings inc well the issue varies by channel so in the ingredient channel some of the demand destruction that occurred during ai as customers formulated away from egg has persisted and thats taking longer to return and some of that maybe permanent that of course is our lowest margin channel within the balance of food service and retail its not so much that egg demand has weakened its during ai when supply was just proportionally impactful on valueadded eggs some of that demand has shifted to shelled eggs and with the relatively higher cost of grainbased eggs versus marketbased eggs today it is slower to return to grainbased eggs so what we need in order to fully exit from the ai event is the normalization of pricing between the grainbased cost and the market cost which is longterm an equilibrium that must be maintained so once thats achieved which we believe is a near to intermediate term event we believe to see a reconversion back to valueadded eggs on a grain basis as weve seen for so many years previously john joseph baumgartner  wells fargo securities llc how are you seeing that business kind of track sequentially into q robert v vitale  post holdings inc in order to meet the guidance it would be growth from q to q and that was consistent with our plan throughout the year we had – always forecast q to be the nadir john joseph baumgartner  wells fargo securities llc and then presumably you should see on a yearonyear basis a benefit on the feed cost side as well correct between corn and bean meal robert v vitale  post holdings inc yes that reduces some of our cost on a grain basis and starts to shrink the delta between the grainbased cost and the marketbased cost in a normal environment that would simply be a passthrough so it might be helpful just to spend  seconds reminding everyone that in a normal environment we are somewhat indifferent to the cost of eggs because we sell  of our product on a grainbased formula and we procure  on a grainbased formula likewise we do  on market both selling and procuring where we are this year is because of the timing of recovery and supply we are excessively supplied on a grain basis in a time where market prices are quite low so yes the answer to your question is this year that will have a positive impact in normal years its simply a passthrough john joseph baumgartner  wells fargo securities llc okay and then just lastly as a followup in terms of weetabix i mean that deal is a bit different for you in terms of not having a platform to bolt it on  to really accentuate the synergies but i mean can you speak to any sort of operational improvements or just business process cost savings that would fall outside the scope of a traditional synergy bucket that you can kind of go after the first year to after this deal closes robert v vitale  post holdings inc sure let me disagree with you a bit in that when you bring together post consumer brands weetabix north america and attune foods you have a pretty meaningful consolidation opportunity within north america so it fits nicely within our existing north american cereal platform in the uk which is the second largest active nutrition market in the world we expect that to be an attractive platform for expanding our premier business into the uk which is already happening so we do believe there are some platform aspects of weetabix that may not be selfevident beyond that we think that there are some opportunities to look at manufacturing processes specifically and maybe some distribution processes and share best practices between pcb and weetabix that could be impactful to the margin structure of each business so we look for cost reduction opportunities that would be not necessarily typical synergies but are cost reduction nonetheless john joseph baumgartner  wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks rob robert v vitale  post holdings inc sure thank you john operator your next question comes from the line of andrew lazar of barclays andrew lazar  barclays capital inc good morning everybody robert v vitale  post holdings inc hey andrew andrew lazar  barclays capital inc hi just a couple things one quick one first unless im mistaken i think you reported sales this quarter on kind of a pro forma basis rather than maybe the way you had previously which was sort of organic and then sort of the impact of what net acquisitions and divestitures did do i have this right and im just curious if so what led to the change in how you reported it robert v vitale  post holdings inc were actually reporting it the same way but the terminology is different and the reason is in response to an sec comment so pro forma as currently in the press release is what we used to call comparable basis andrew lazar  barclays capital inc got it so comparable basis in previous releases had – you had made the adjustment in the year ago for what acquisitions had added okay robert v vitale  post holdings inc right and weve continued to do that the sec took exception to the term comparable basis they did not take exception to the actual math behind comparable basis they just didnt like the terminology so we changed it to pro forma andrew lazar  barclays capital inc got it okay thanks for the clarification with respect to ebitda margins in consumer brands segment up nearly i guess yearoveryear almost  basis points or so and i guess i assume theres a lot of obviously the mom brand synergy coming through and maybe not repeating some of the discretionary spend i think from last year i guess more importantly at this stage i guess what you see as a sort of more sustainable margin level for that business going forward robert v vitale  post holdings inc i think we are at approximately the sustainable level as we start to look into ways to try to grow the business the tension between growth and margin will keep a lid on driving margin beyond this current point and maybe put some pressure downward andrew lazar  barclays capital inc okay and last thing just in active nutrition i seem to remember – although again i could have this a little wrong but youve talked in the past about getting that business up to a certain level of scale from an ebitda generation perspective that would give you enough scale to think about over time strategic optionality with it if you felt maybe that you either werent getting the proper credit for that business and the growth opportunity and your current valuation or other things and i seem to remember maybe it being kind of more like  million or so of ebitda would give you that kind of scale i could have that wrong but if its right it looks like potentially thats where you could be by the end of this fiscal year so i was hoping you could just comment a little bit on that and let me know if i have that right or wrong robert v vitale  post holdings inc you certainly have it right that that is the way we think in terms of viewing our portfolio as a dynamic one that we would look to try to create ownership where the ownership is most appropriately valuing the assets whether thats a spin or whatever it may entail whether thats a bright line  million ebitda or something higher than that is less clear and there are more facts and circumstances than simply the level of ebitda but i think to the key point that the growth in the business creates optionality that previously didnt exist is absolutely accurate andrew lazar  barclays capital inc okay thanks very much robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bill chappell of suntrust william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks good morning robert v vitale  post holdings inc hey bill william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc rob you were kind enough to say you thought there were considerable consolidation opportunities for weetabix north america yet i guess were still sticking with  million of synergies on a  billion acquisition so would you be willing to kind of expand on where you think there are further synergies is that number maybe a conservative number just because it does seem also with – even the announcements of bringing attune and others under one roof there would be more nearterm synergy opportunities robert v vitale  post holdings inc no were not going to increase the synergy estimate today i think that as always we tend to approach things from a conservative perspective and try to overdeliver where possible so having just announced the deal three weeks ago and are just now starting the integration planning while we do believe there are opportunities that will fall out from this that are not anticipated there are also likely some risks that will fall out that are not anticipated so we want to approach this from a balanced perspective and be prudent in our estimates william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay but bringing attune and all that under one roof was that contemplated on the original transaction robert v vitale  post holdings inc it was and we think that that affords more opportunity for better focus more than it does significant cost reduction because the manufacturing processes are considerably different william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and switching to eggs since youre talking today now that the yearoveryear loss will be at the high end does that mean as we look at your full year ebitda guidance we should be focusing more on the low end or is it the full range still available to you robert v vitale  post holdings inc i would not assume that the difference between  million and  million necessarily ties to the low or high end we had planned various scenarios so i would answer the question by saying the entirety of the range remains within our reach or we would have brought the high end of the range down william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and im just asking that because is there certain businesses – i mean should we look at active nutrition is outperforming kind of your original expectations robert v vitale  post holdings inc for the year i would characterize our – i mean if you go back to the beginning of the year i think our original estimate was  to   and we said it was slightly skewed to the second half and that we increased the bottom yeartodate were at roughly  million of ebitda so i would characterize this as almost precisely on plan with a little bit of over performance elsewhere covering for a little bit of greater pressure on the michael side but we have factored multiple scenarios into the guidance that allows us to meet the different levels in the guidance depending on a number of different variables that come into play william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and then last one for me on honey bunches of oats you talked about some distribution losses is that comes from the ancillary products off the honey bunches family or were you actually seeing some delistings of the core products robert v vitale  post holdings inc no the former we had overextended the brand into some noncore skus and what were trying to do is really focus on the core skus and get better velocities on the core rather than have too many different phasings william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it thanks so much robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you bill operator your next question comes from the line of chris growe of stifel christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good morning robert v vitale  post holdings inc chris christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi i had just two questions for you first off and a bit of a followup when you think about the upper end of the range for the michael foods egg ebitda decline does that require then an improved rate of pricing through the second half of the year is that incorporated in your guidance  main metrics were looking for for that improvement robert v vitale  post holdings inc no it implies a constant rate based on where we are now so we think weve got a reasonably cautious outlook from here christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thats great and then i wondered if you could characterize the ebitda contribution from the egg business in relation to history are we back to average levels are we below average levels can you give any kind of color around that robert v vitale  post holdings inc we would be below average levels in dollars but above average levels in margin christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you and then just one final one if i could which is in relation to the cereal business are you seeing any inventory adjustments there declines there at retail that are affecting your sales – retail inventory that is robert v vitale  post holdings inc did you say in the cereal business jeff a zadoks  post holdings inc yeah christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc i did im sorry yes robert v vitale  post holdings inc no we think our retail inventory is in relative equilibrium the shipment difference between or the difference between shipment and consumption was more a function of measured channels and unmeasured channels the items that jeff mentioned around government bids and comanufacturing christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of cornell burnette of citi cornell r burnette  citigroup global markets inc good morning and thanks for the questions robert v vitale  post holdings inc thanks cornell cornell r burnette  citigroup global markets inc i just wanted to start off on the michael foods business seems like within the guidance some of the current fundamentals in the egg market are pretty much expected to prevail over the course of the year so in that context i wanted to know kind of what drives maybe some of the sequential improvements that you have baked into your model for the back half of the year relative to what we saw on the second quarter robert v vitale  post holdings inc the imbalance that we had in the grainbased versus marketbased supplyanddemand equilibrium was most pronounced in the first quarter cornell r burnette  citigroup global markets inc okay and then on just kind of moving along through cereal i think for the cereal volumes you guys are down modest  thats in sharp contrast maybe to what weve seen generally throughout us food with a lot of weak volumes kind of coming through the sector in the first quarter so i just wanted to know kind of how is post able to  i think cereal market share in nielsen data was at least up  basis points over the quarter and so where have you been sourcing share from in the category and maybe how sustainable are these results robert v vitale  post holdings inc well if we had a silver bullet we would not talk about it here but the – i think the reality is that mom brands is the one cereal business that does have some distribution opportunities whereas everybody else has a near ubiquitous presence so were gaining some distribution as we talked about in the prepared comments cornell r burnette  citigroup global markets inc okay and then lastly on active nutrition kind of going back to distribution how much of that topline growth is really just coming from distribution gains at premier where are we in that process and is there any way that you can kind of size up the opportunities that you have for premier and kind of the distribution within the us going forward robert v vitale  post holdings inc its roughly half distribution and half incremental velocity i think the category is still a relatively small developing category so we see it to be a meaningful opportunity longer term cornell r burnette  citigroup global markets inc okay thanks a lot and ill pass it along robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim ramey of pivotal research timothy s ramey  pivotal research group llc thanks so much good morning robert v vitale  post holdings inc hi tim timothy s ramey  pivotal research group llc rob you kind of started with comments on our key segment data and im wondering if you think there is any inflection point here in the category more broadly or is this just a continuation of the steady glide path that weve seen for many years robert v vitale  post holdings inc i would say its a modest increase in the glide path we saw last year a bit better comp and were seeing a little bit worse comp i think if you look deeper and this information is available to everybody so theres nothing terribly insightful here is that presweetened cereals are driven by household formation of households with children and the family size is smaller so we are continuing to be stable in that category but in smaller households and that the adult brands are declining as baby boomers leave the category for more proteinrich alternatives so the consumers who we need to focus on in order to completely stabilize the category are the ones who grow up on cereal and its somewhat counterintuitive but the data is pretty clear and available to everyone timothy s ramey  pivotal research group llc got it and relative to michael foods group your discussion really sort of centered around the mix changed between valueadded eggs and shell eggs but the consistent backdrop to that business has been greater overall adoption of valueadded eggs on menus in the qsr business do you think thats not so much of a factor say in the next  to  months or are we maxed out right now with everybody is doing breakfast robert v vitale  post holdings inc no i think quite the opposite once we have a more normalization between the relationship between grainbased cost and market cost we will see a return to that longterm trend that youre referring to because from a menu perspective its just eggs from a product supply perspective its a valueadded egg which is significantly more cost efficient in normal environments than a shelled egg and im mostly referring to the labor side of it so we expect once we have more of a correction in the price exiting the ai event that the trend that was so strong for quite some time five plus years will return and that we should see a meaningful step change in our value added or our grainbased business after we get to normalization so the disappointing aspect of it this year is that prices have been stubbornly low and have caused the qsrs and some of the other food service customers to delay returns to grainbased valueadded eggs after they were forced to move away from it during ai timothy s ramey  pivotal research group llc got it okay thanks so much robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow of bank of montreal kenneth bryan zaslow  bmo capital markets united states hi good morning everyone robert v vitale  post holdings inc ken kenneth bryan zaslow  bmo capital markets united states just to maybe continue on michael foods but i guess what im trying to figure out is beyond  how you guys set up for growth in terms of topline and margins do we reach a more steady state going into  and beyond and how do you think of that robert v vitale  post holdings inc circling back on the question that tim asked we would expect to see a resumption of the longterm trend after a potentially more accelerated reconversion to grainbased valueadded eggs so we think the original algorithm that attracted us to the company remains intact albeit disrupted now for a multiyear period with respect to margin as we said almost from the outset of the ai event we expect to exit ai with a more profitable mix as our ingredient business emerges as a smaller percentage of our overall portfolio kenneth bryan zaslow  bmo capital markets united states my second question is you actually said in your prepared remarks that the weetabix synergies will be longer term than that of the mom acquisition was that – maybe i dont know if i misinterpreted that it was longer term relative or just that it was longer term because its just after the facts of mom  i just wanted to make sure i understood the clarification of that robert v vitale  post holdings inc the latter the execution timeframe is very similar its just where we are in the process kenneth bryan zaslow  bmo capital markets united states okay so theres nothing to read into okay and then my final question is on the marketing and trade spending did you say now in  its going to be flat yearoveryear relative to – was it supposed to be higher or has that changed can you just discuss your marketing and trade spending going forward robert v vitale  post holdings inc so the trade spending what we commented on as the trade rate which was higher in the first half for the year than the first half of the comparable period last year does not reflect a shift its just a timing phenomenon where the calendar was more frontloaded this year so itd essentially be the same with respect to some of the advertising spend if you recall last year we stepped up the advertising expense considerably weve brought it back down to a more normalized level this year kenneth bryan zaslow  bmo capital markets united states great thank you very much robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brett hundley of the vertical group brett hundley  vertical group hey thanks guys good morning robert v vitale  post holdings inc good morning brett hundley  vertical group question on cheese business dynamics within michael just curious if the sequence of events there q q to q if it concerns you at all and can you give us an idea of maybe how to think about the drag on segment profitability going forward from whats happening in that business robert v vitale  post holdings inc well it certainly concerns us its a relatively smaller business within our portfolio but nonetheless its something that we are digging into we had some distribution losses that were disappointing with a key customer that was a surprise that we probably should have anticipated but did not the aggregate softness in the category i think is more of a phenomenon that is in the early stages and hopefully temporary but if not were going to have to dig into it more the most recent periods covered an easter overlap that we think is distorting the nielsen data but were going to give that one a little bit more time to draw some conclusions on theres nothing that jumps out that says that the demand for cheese has changed materially so we expect it to be a temporary blip brett hundley  vertical group i appreciate that and then just one last one for me rob i just want to get your perspective on brand support spend as a whole so when i think about i guess two main buckets of advertising investment spend and then your trade spend and how thats been set up this year a lot of us on this side are thinking a lot about the evolving retail environment the evolving competitive environment especially given a slow start to the year in january and february you guys your promo plan in cereal has kind of been weighted towards the front half of your fiscal year you have a number of competitors talking about really bringing their own performance up in the back half of the calendar year and then you have this evolving retail set of course where we hear a lot of stories about different reactions that are occurring across the retail landscape so the point it was just brought up youve kind of walked back that additional advertising investment spend from last year when you guys look at the landscape in front of you for maybe the remaining part of the fiscal year or the calendar year here can you just talk to us a little bit about your comfort with delivering on fullyear expectations again with having your promo plan a little bit more frontend loaded and continuing to bring down your ad investment spend yearonyear hope that question makes sense robert v vitale  post holdings inc it makes a lot of sense i would start by saying that there are some competitive tensions in that question that is going to lead me to be less candid than i like to be so im not going to get into it too much other than to say that we feel very comfortable with the plan we have for the year we feel good about our position and the ability to continue to market to both the consumer and to be a strong partner with the trade but in this forum i dont think i want to add much more to that brett hundley  vertical group okay thank you robert v vitale  post holdings inc thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers i will now return the call to rob vitale for any additional or closing remarks robert v vitale  post holdings inc one of these days im going to come up with some good closing remarks other than just thank you but for now thank you and we look forward to talking to you again in august thank you all operator thank you for participating in post holdings

brad thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results we previewed these results when we announced our weetabix acquisition this morning jeff and i will go into detail on the quarter and provide some information on how we intend to integrate and report weetabix our second quarter results were in line with our expectations as michael foods group adjusted ebitda declined materially and was largely but not entirely offset by growth in each of our other segments in general this year is shaping up as expected with our cereal business moving into the final stages of the post foodsmom brands integration our valueadded egg business cycling over extraordinary comparisons our protein business experiencing abovemarket growth and our private brands business generating steady performance after a brief operational slipread moremore specifically with respect to each segment post consumer brands continues to execute on synergy opportunities and to build upon market momentum this quarter we continue to take actions to optimize our production and distribution network and we expect to implement plans throughout the year our initial network optimization effort resulting from the postmom merger will be completed early next year additional opportunities resulting from weetabix will develop over a longer time frame as always we remain focused on continuous cost reduction across the organizationrecently cereal category trends have worsened this quarter the category declined  in dollars and  in pounds a more segmented analysis shows that in comparison to category averages declines are most pronounced in the adult brands about average in all family brands but kids cereal is growing in pounds with dollars flat our consumption performance was strong with dollars increasing  and pounds increasing  we grew both base and incremental consumption posts dollar and pound share increased to  and  respectively performance benefited from a promotional plan more heavily weighted to the first half of fiscal  on a full year basis we anticipate fiscal  trade levels to be comparable with pebbles and maltomeal bags each had a great quarter pebbles grew pound consumption  driven by strong base turns and maltomeal bags grew  driven by additional items on shelf honey bunches of oats consumption was pressured by distribution losses but incremental pound consumption grew  resulting from increased merchandising support great grains consumption comparison remains negatively impacted by products discontinued in  our fourth quarter will be the first fully comparable period however core great grains consumption performance was soft this quarter with modest gains in base consumption performance offset by incremental lossesmichael foods performed as expected this quarter we continue to expect to lap the impact of avian influenza during the second half of fiscal  recall we planned for a reduction in the michael foods group ebitda resulting from an aidriven imbalance of oversupplied grainbased eggs versus grainbased demand essentially we are selling higher costing grainbased eggs at persistently low market prices we now estimate the decline in this segments ebitda at the high side of our previous range of  million to  million which has been factored into our guidanceactive nutrition continues to show great growth driven by premier protein shakes and bars the premier protein brand is driving category growth and we continue to see great potential for the brand powerbar continues to be weighed down by distribution losses dymatize has stabilized however the specialty channel continues to be weak within private brands second quarter results are burdened by comanufacturer expenses we expected to be able to insource granola manufacturing for which we had undertaken a capacity expansion we experienced a small fire that will delay the new capacity coming online until next fiscal yearat our nut butter and dried fruit and nut businesses we have moved to address inefficiencies including eliminating unprofitable skus were also narrowing our focus to less complex product solutions before turning the call over to jeff i want to preview some organizational changes and discuss our valuecreating algorithmwe are quite optimistic about our pending acquisition of weetabix it diversifies our portfolio with a leading iconic uk brand in one of our core categories it expands our presence in the worlds secondlargest active nutrition market it is a leading producer of organic and nongmo readytoeat cereal products in north america it creates optionality for us in the uk and in europe to grow organically and through maupon closing the weetabix transaction weetabix uk and ireland will be a standalone business within our portfolio and weetabix north american operations will be combined into post consumer brands additionally its the right time to bring all our cereal brands under one unitwith this in mind we will also move the attune foods cereal and granola business into post consumer brands attune and weetabix north america are both tightly focused on the health and wellness segment of readytoeat cereal this will allow each business to share best practices manage costs on a combined basis and leverage the capabilities and strengths of the combined business beyond the uk and north america the weetabix acquisition creates holding companywide scale in certain international markets in these key markets we will create a consolidated presence to support resources in each marketin closing i want to review our valuecreation algorithm including weetabix we expect to consistently add  to  to our ebitda and generate cash flow in excess of  million the impact of ebitda growth and debt reduction produces a midteens longterm rate of growth and equity value at a constant multiplemoreover we hope to allocate capital to more attractive purposes than debt reduction over time we will tend to invest in larger slowergrowing companies and smaller fastergrowing companies in this manner we can maintain both the capacity to leverage our cash flow and the potential to grow it with weetabix we will acquire a slowgrowth business with synergies and enormous amount of optionality we will finance it without incremental equity in fact we are increasing our leverage and reducing our cost of capital the transformative diversification of our cash flow including weetabix produces this outcome and enables us to continue seeking attractive investment opportunitieswith that i will turn the call over to jeffjeff a zadoks post holdings inc  cfo and svp thanks rob and good morning everyone second quarter performance was in line with our expectations with consolidated net sales of  billion and adjusted ebitda of  millionturning to our segment results and beginning with post consumer brands net sales were  million a decline of  compared to the prior year total volumes declined  resulting from decreases in lowermargin comanufacturing and government bid business however product mix improved with strong sales volume increases for  of our  core brands maltomeal bags and pebblesvolumes for our other core brands honey bunches of oats and great grains experienced declines this primarily resulted from lapping a prioryear honey bunches of oats club promotion that did not repeat and the exit of certain discontinued great grains skus as we move into the third quarter we have now fully lapped the reduced comanufacturing volumes and we will lap the discontinued great grains skus in our fourth quarter however we will not lap the reduced government bid business volumes until the end of the fiscal yearpost consumer brands adjusted ebitda was approximately  million for the quarter and benefited from manufacturing cost savings improved product mix and reduced consumer advertising and promotion this was partially offset by a higher trade promotion rate the trade promotion rate for the second quarter was in line with the first quarter rate we continue to expect lower promotional spend in the second half of the year based on the timing of our promotional activitiesmichael foods group net sales were  million a decline of  on a pro forma basis egg volumes increased  also on a pro forma basis we continue to see delays in customers returning to valueadded egg products with the ongoing low market prices for shell eggs this contributes to the imbalance rob mentioned earlier egg revenues decreased  as we continue to lap the impact of avian influenza pricing we also continue to experience lower pricing to our marketbased customers in line with urner barry market pricesas with the first quarter cheese volumes declined significantly resulting from the exit of certain lowmargin private label business in the fourth quarter of fiscal  this quarter we also experienced branded cheese distribution losses and we saw general weakness in the cheese demandmichael foods group adjusted ebitda was  million and well below the comparable prioryear period as we continue to progress through the egg market recovery from ai recall we anticipated our second quarter yearoveryear adjusted ebitda performance gap in this segment would be greater than in the first quarter and that turned out to be the case we continue to expect the yearoveryear performance gap to shrink during our third and fourth quarters when compared to the second quartermoving to active nutrition net sales were  million an increase of  compared to the prior year growth in protein  premier protein shakes and bars was partially offset by declines for powerbar dymatize branded net sales were up  from higher volumes partially offset by increased trade spend resulting from lapping unusually low trade rates in the prioryear periodactive nutrition adjusted ebitda was  million and benefited from higher premier protein volumes and lower raw material costs this was partially offset by increased advertising and promotional spend across all  brands recall that quarterly margins in this segment fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of promotional activity and levels of consumer marketing spending we saw higher trade and marketing levels in the second quarter and expect this to repeat in the fourth quarter we continue to expect fiscal  annual adjusted ebitda margins in this segment to be in the mid to high teensturning to private brands net sales were  million an increase of  compared to the prior year revenue benefited from growth in volumes of highermargin tree nut butters and organic peanut butter sales revenue were negatively impacted by volume declines for dry fruit and nut and lower net pricing for almond and walnut products related to passthrough of declining input costs private brands adjusted ebitda was  million and benefited from the favorable nut butter product mix this was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies in dried food and nut and comanufacturing costs in the granola businessbefore reviewing our guidance i would like to comment on our operating cash flows and capital markets transactions our cash flow from operations for the first  months of fiscal  was significantly lower than the comparable prioryear period current year cash flow was negatively impacted by  items first we paid  million in legal settlements related to egg antitrust lawsuits second earlier in the fiscal year we paid abovetarget bonuses that resulted from strong performance last year finally we experienced an increase in working capital which was mostly driven by timingwe expect operating cash flow in the second half of fiscal  to be considerably higher than the first half as a result of modestly improved operating performance and the absence of the aforementioned items in fact in april alone we generated approximately  million of cashmoving to our capital markets transactions in midfebruary we opportunistically refinanced and extended the maturities for a portion of our fixedrate bonds by issuing  billion of  senior notes due in  and  million of  senior notes due in  these proceeds were used in part to fund redemptions in march of all of our outstanding  senior notes due in  and  senior notes due in  for the aggregate principal that was redeemed we achieved  million of annual reduction in our interest costsin march we amended and restated our credit agreement in doing so we extended its term to march of  increased the size of our revolver to  million lowered the cost of borrowing under the facility and created greater flexibility within the covenantsyesterday we announced that we intend to raise approximately  billion in term loan debt we anticipate using these funds for both the acquisition of weetabix and our tender offers for our  senior notes due in  and  senior notes due in  giving full credit for the second quarter and upcoming capital markets transactions and the weetabix acquisition we expect pro forma net leverage as measured by our credit facility to be approximately x and our quarterly net interest expense to be approximately  million at this net leverage level we continue to have flexibility to pursue new ma opportunitiesconcluding with our outlook we continue to expect fiscal  adjusted ebitda to range between  million and  million excluding any contribution from weetabixwith that i would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions operatorquestions and answersoperator operator instructions your first question comes the line of john baumgartner of wells fargojohn joseph baumgartner wells fargo securities llc research division  vp and senior analyst rob id like to ask at the michael business what are your thoughts as to why demand has been so slow to respond there i mean i have to think that on a price basis eggs really have to offer quite significant value relative to the proteins for the end customers how do you really explain the demand softnessrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director well the issue varied by channel so in the ingredient channel some of the demand destruction that occurred during ai as customers formulated away from egg has persisted and thats taking longer to return and some of that may be permanent that of course is our lowestmargin channelwithin the balance of foodservice and retail its not so much that egg demand has weakened its that during ai when supply was disproportionately impactful on valueadded eggs some of that demand has shifted to shelled eggs and with the relatively higher cost of grainbased eggs versus marketbased eggs today it is slower to return to grainbased eggsso what we need in order to fully exit from the ai event is the normalization of pricing between the grainbased cost and the market cost which is longterm an equilibrium that must be maintained so once thats achieved which we believe is a near to intermediateterm event we will we believe see a reconversion back to valueadded egg on a grain basis as weve seen for so many years previouslyjohn joseph baumgartner wells fargo securities llc research division  vp and senior analyst how are you seeing that business kind of track sequentially into qrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director in order to meet the guidance it would be growth from q to q and that was consistent with our plan throughout the year we had always forecast q to be the nadirjohn joseph baumgartner wells fargo securities llc research division  vp and senior analyst and then presumably you should see on a yearonyear basis a benefit on the feed cost side as well correct between corn and bean mealrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director yes that reduces some of our cost on a grain basis and starts to shrink the delta between the grainbased cost and the marketbased cost in a normal environment that would simply be a passthrough so it might be helpful just to spend  seconds reminding everyone that in a normal environment we are somewhat indifferent to the cost of eggs because we sell  of our product on a grainbased formula and we procure  on a grainbased formula likewise we do  of market both selling and procuringwhere we are this year is because of the timing of recovery of supply we are excessively supplied on a grain basis in a time where market prices are quite low so yes the answer to your question is this year that will have a positive impact in normal years its simply a passthroughjohn joseph baumgartner wells fargo securities llc research division  vp and senior analyst okay and just lastly as a followup in terms of weetabix that deals a bit different for you in terms of not having a platform to bolt it on to to really accentuate the synergies but can you speak to any sort of operational improvements or just business process cost savings that would fall outside the scope of a traditional synergy bucket that you can kind of go after the first year or  after this deal closesrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director sure let me disagree with you a bit in that when you bring together post consumer brands weetabix north america and attune foods you have a pretty meaningful consolidation opportunity within north america so it fits nicely within our existing north american cereal platformin the uk which is the secondlargest active nutrition market in the world we expect that to be an attractive platform for commanding our premier business into the uk which is already happening so we do believe there are some platform aspects of weetabix that may not be selfevidentbeyond that we think that there are some opportunities to look at manufacturing processes specifically and maybe some distribution processes and share best practices between pcb and weetabix that could be impactful to the margin structure of each business so we look for cost reduction opportunities that would be not necessarily typical synergies but are cost reduction nonethelessoperator your next question comes from the line of andrew lazar of barclaysandrew lazar barclays plc research division  md and senior research analyst couple things one quick one first unless im mistaken i think you reported sales this quarter on kind of a pro forma basis rather than maybe the way you had previously which was sort of organic and then sort of the impact of what net acquisitions and divestitures did do i have this right and im just curious if so what led to the change in how youve reported itrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director were actually reporting it the same way but the terminology is different and the reason is in response to an sec comment so pro forma as currently in the press release is what we used to call comparable basisandrew lazar barclays plc research division  md and senior research analyst got it so comparable basis in previous releases had  you had made the adjustment in the year ago for what acquisitions had addedrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director right and weve continued to do that the sec took exception to the term comparable basis they did not take exception to the actual math behind comparable basis they just didnt like the terminology so we changed it to pro formaandrew lazar barclays plc research division  md and senior research analyst got it okay with respect to ebitda margins in the consumer brands segment up nearly i guess yearoveryear almost  basis points or so and i guess i assume theres a lot of obviously the mom brand synergy coming through and maybe not repeating some of the discretionary spend i think from last year i guess more importantly at this staging is what do you see as a sort of more sustainable margin level for that business going forwardrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director i think we are at approximately the sustainable level as we start to look into ways to try to grow the business the tension between growth and margin will keep a lid on driving margin beyond its current point and maybe put some pressure downwardandrew lazar barclays plc research division  md and senior research analyst okay and last thing just on active nutrition i seem to remember  although again i could have this a little wrong that youve talked in the past about getting that business up to a certain level of scale from an ebitda generation perspective that would give you enough scale to think about over time strategic optionality with it if you felt maybe that you either werent getting the proper credit for that business and the growth opportunity in your current valuation or other thingsand i seem to remember maybe it being kind of more of  million or so of ebitda would give you that kind of scale i could have that wrong but if its right it looks like potentially thats where you could be by the end of this fiscal year so i was hoping you could just comment a little bit on that and let me know if i have that right or wrongrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director you certainly have it right that that is the way we think in terms of viewing our portfolio as a dynamic one that we would look to try to create ownership where the ownership is most appropriately valuing the assets whether thats a spin or whatever it may entail whether thats a bright line  million ebitda or something higher than that is less clear and there are more effects and circumstances than simply the level of ebitda but i think to the key point that the growth in the business creates optionality that previously didnt exist is absolutely accurateoperator your next question comes from the line of bill chappell of suntrustwilliam bates chappell suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  md rob you were kind enough to say you thought there were considerable consolidation opportunities for weetabix north america yet i guess were still sticking with  million of synergies on a  billion acquisition so would you be willing to kind of expand on where you think there are further synergies is that number maybe a conservative member or just  because it does seem also with even the announcements of bringing attune and others under one roof there would be more nearterm synergy opportunitiesrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director no were not going to increase the synergy estimate today i think that as always we tend to approach things from a conservative perspective and try to overdeliver where possible so having just announced the deal  weeks ago and are just now starting the integration planning while we do believe there are opportunities that will fall out from this that are not anticipated there are also likely some risks that will fall out that are not anticipated so we want to approach this from a balanced perspective and be prudent in our estimateswilliam bates chappell suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  md okay but the bringing attune and all that under one roof was that contemplated on the original transactionrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director it was and we think that that affords more opportunity for better focus more than it does significant cost reduction because the manufacturing processes are considerably differentwilliam bates chappell suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  md okay and switching to eggs since youre talking today now that the yearoveryear loss will be at the high end does that mean as we look at your full year ebitda guidance we should be focusing more on the low end or is the full range still available to yourobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director i would not assume that the difference between  million and  million necessarily ties to the low or high end we had planned various scenarios so i would answer the question by saying the entirety of the range remains within our reach or we wouldve brought the high end of the range downwilliam bates chappell suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  md but  and im just asking that because  is there certain businesses i mean should we look at active nutrition is outperforming kind of your original expectationsrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director for the year i would characterize our  i mean if you go back to the beginning of the year i think our original estimate was  million to  million and we said it was slightly skewed to the second half and then we increased the bottom yeartodate were at roughly  million of ebitda so i would characterize us as almost precisely on plan with a little bit of overperformance elsewhere covering for a little bit of greater pressure on the michael side but we have factored multiple scenarios into the guidance that allows us to meet the different levels in the guidance depending on a number of different variables that come into playwilliam bates chappell suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division  md okay and then last one for me on honey bunches of oats you talked about some distribution losses is that some of the ancillary products off the honey bunches family or were you actually seeing some delistings of the core productsrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director no the former we had overextended the brand into some noncore skus and what were trying to do is really focus on the core skus and get better velocities on the core rather than have too many different facingsoperator your next question comes from the line of chris growe of stifelchristopher robert growe stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division  md and analyst i had just  questions for you first off and a bit of a followup when you think about the upper end of the range for the michael foods egg ebitda decline does that require then an improved rate of pricing through the second half of the year is that incorporated into your guidance level where kind of the  one of the main metrics were looking for for that improvementrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director no it implies a constant rate based on where we are now so we think weve got a reasonably cautious outlook from herechristopher robert growe stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division  md and analyst okay thats great and then i wonder if you could characterize the ebitda contribution from the egg business in relation to history are we back to average levels are we below average levels can you give any kind of color around thatrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director we would be below average levels in dollars but above average levels in marginchristopher robert growe stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division  md and analyst okay and then just one final one if i could which is in relation to the cereal business are you seeing any inventory adjustments there declines there at retail that are affecting your salesrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director chris did you say in the cereal businesschristopher robert growe stifel nicolaus  company incorporated research division  md and analyst i did im sorry yesrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director no we think our retail inventory is in relative equilibrium the shipment difference between  or the difference between shipments and consumption was more a function of measured channels and unmeasured channels the items that jeff mentioned around government bids and comanufacturingoperator your next question comes from the line of cornell burnette of citicornell r burnette citigroup inc research division  vp and analyst just wanted to start off on the michael foods business it seems like within the guidance some of the current fundamentals that are in the egg market are pretty much expected to prevail over the course of the year so in that context i wanted to know kind of what drives maybe some of the sequential improvements that you have baked into your model for the back half of the year relative to what we saw in the second quarterrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director the imbalance that we had in the grainbased versus marketbased supply and demand equilibrium was most pronounced in the first quartercornell r burnette citigroup inc research division  vp and analyst okay and then on just kind of moving along to cereal i think before the cereal volumes you guys were down a modest  thats in sharp contrast maybe to what weve seen generally throughout us food with a lot of weak volumes kind of coming through the sector in the first quarter so just wanted to know kind of how was post able to buck this trend i think cereal market share in nielsen data was at least up  basis points over the quarter and so where have you been sourcing share from in the category and maybe how sustainable are these resultsrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director well if we had a silver bullet we would not talk about it here but the  i think the reality is that mom brands is the one cereal business that does have some distribution opportunities whereas everybody else has a nearubiquitous presence so were gaining some distribution as we talked about in the prepared commentscornell r burnette citigroup inc research division  vp and analyst okay and then lastly on active nutrition kind of going back to distribution how much of that top line growth is really just coming from distribution gains at premier where are we in that process and is there any way that you can kind of size up the opportunities that you have for premier and kind of the distribution within the us going forwardrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director its roughly half distribution and half incremental velocity i think the category is still a relatively small developing category so we see it to be a meaningful opportunity longertermoperator your next question comes from the line of tim ramey of pivotal researchtimothy s ramey pivotal research group llc  head of consumer sector research and senior analyst of food beverage and nutrition rob you started with comments on rtes segment data and im wondering if you think theres any inflection point here in the category more broadly or is this just a continuation of the steady glide path that weve seen for many yearsrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director i would say its a modest increase in the glide path we saw last year a bit better comp and were seeing a little bit worse comp i think if you look deeper  and this information is available to everybody so theres nothing terribly insightful here  is that presweetened cereals are driven by household  formation of households with children and the family size is smaller so we are continuing to be stable in that category but in smaller households and that the adult brands are declining as baby boomers leave the category for more proteinrich alternativesso the consumers who we need to focus on in order to completely stabilize the category are the ones who grew up on cereal and its somewhat counterintuitive but the datas pretty clear and available to everyonetimothy s ramey pivotal research group llc  head of consumer sector research and senior analyst of food beverage and nutrition got it and relative to michael food group your discussion really sort of centered around the mix change between valueadded eggs and shell eggs but the consistent backdrop to that business has been greater overall adoption of valueadded eggs on menus in the qsr business do you think thats not so much of a factor say in the next  to  months or are we maxed out right now with everybodys doing breakfastrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director no i think quite the opposite it will  once we have a more normalization between the relationship between grainbased cost and market cost we will see a return to that longterm trend that youre referring to because from a menu perspective its just eggs from a product supply perspective its valueadded egg which is significantly more costefficient in normal environments than a shelled egg and im mostly referring to the labor assignmentso we expect once we have more of a correction in the price exiting the ai event that the trend that was so strong for quite some time plus years will return and that we should see a meaningful step change in our valueadded or our grainbased business after we get to normalization so that the disappointing aspect of it this year is that prices have been stubbornly low and have caused the qsrs and some of the other foodservice customers to delay returns to grainbased valueadded eggs after they were forced to move away from it during aioperator your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow of bank of montrealkenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets equity research  md of food and agribusiness research and food and beverage analyst just to maybe continue on michael foods but i guess what im trying to figure out is beyond  how are you guys set up for growth in terms of top line and margins do we reach a more steady state going into  and beyond and how do you think of thatrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director well kind of circling back on the question that tim asked we would expect to see a resumption of a longterm trend after a potentially more accelerated reconversion to grainbased valueadded eggs so we think the original algorithm that attracted us to the company remains intact albeit disrupted now for a multiyear period with respect to margin as we said almost from the outset of the ai event we expect to exit ai with a more profitable mix as our ingredient business emerges as a smaller percentage of our overall portfoliokenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets equity research  md of food and agribusiness research and food and beverage analyst my second question is you actually said in your prepared remarks that the weetabix synergies will be longerterm than that of the mom acquisition was that maybe  i dont know if i misinterpreted just that it was longerterm relative or just that it was longerterm because its just after the facts of mom and its scheduled time so i just want to make sure i understood the clarification on thatrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director the latter the execution time frame is very similar its just where we are in the processkenneth bryan zaslow bmo capital markets equity research  md of food and agribusiness research and food and beverage analyst okay so theres nothing to read into okay and then my final question is on the marketing and trade spending did you say now in  its going to be flat yearoveryear relative to it was supposed to be higher or how has that changed can you just discuss your marketing and trade spending going forwardrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director so the trade spending what we commented on is the trade rate which was higher in the first half of the year than the first half of the comparable period last year does not reflect a shift its just a timing phenomenon where the calendar was more frontloaded this year so it would essentially be the same with respect to some of the advertising spend if you recall last year we stepped up the advertising expense considerably weve brought it back down to a more normalized level this yearoperator your next question comes from the line of brett hundley of the vertical groupbrett michael hundley the vertical trading group llc research division  research analyst a question on cheese business dynamics within michael just curious if the sequence of events there q q to q if it concerns you at all and can you give us an idea of maybe how to think about the drag on segment profitability going forward from whats happening in that businessrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director well it certainly concerns us its a relatively smaller business within our portfolio but nonetheless its something that we are digging into we had some distribution losses that were disappointing with a key customer that was a surprise that we probably should have anticipated but did notthe aggregate softness in the category i think is more of a phenomenon that is in the early stages and hopefully temporary but if not were going to have to dig into it more the most recent periods covered an easter overlap that we think is distorting the nielsen data but were going to give that one a little bit more time to draw some conclusions on theres nothing that jumps out that says that the demand for cheese has changed materially so we expect it to be a temporary blipbrett michael hundley the vertical trading group llc research division  research analyst i appreciate that and then just one last one for me rob i just want to get your perspective on brand support spend as a wholeso when i think about i guess  main buckets of advertising investment spend and then your trade spend and how thats been set up this year a lot of us on this side are thinking a lot about the evolving retail environment the evolving competitive environment especially given a slow start to the year in january and february you guys your promo plan in cereal has kind of been weighted towards the front half of your fiscal year you have a number of competitors talking about really bringing their own performance up in the back half of the calendar year and then you have this evolving retail set of course where we hear a lot of stories about different reactions that are occurring across the retail landscapeto the point that was just brought up youve kind of walked back that additional advertising investment spend from last year when you guys look at the landscape in front of you for maybe the remaining part of the fiscal year or the calendar year here can you just talk to us a little bit about your comfort with delivering on fullyear expectations again with having your promo plan a little bit more frontend loaded and continuing to bring down your ad investment spend yearonyear i hope that question makes senserobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director it makes a lot of sense i would start by saying that there are some competitive tensions in that question that is going to lead me to be less candid than i like to be so im not going to get into it too much other than to say that we feel very comfortable with the plan we have for the year we feel good about our position and the ability to continue to market to both the consumer and to be a strong partner with the trade but in this forum i dont think i want to add much more to thatoperator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers i will now return the call to rob vitale for any additional or closing remarksrobert v vitale post holdings inc  ceo president and director one of these days im going to come up with some good
