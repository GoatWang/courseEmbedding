an early fond or funny storymemory about footwear my whole career has been about building global brands such as avon beauty products godiva chocolate and now clarks footwear it’s a dream come true for a woman brand builder –makeup chocolate and shoes — everything a woman could want what are you most excited about at clarks clarks was founded in  and has maintained its strong values and culture i’m quite proud to be part of that tradition i’m also excited about the future and our ability to grow the brand i work with a very talented team we have a fabulous product and we cover a vast geography

experience that i endured at the clarks store at the willowbrook mall in houston texas i was greeted by a sales person who was not very welcoming it was as if he did not want to be working that day there was no smile or happy greeting the sales person measured my foot and stated i measured a   i advised him i normally wear a 0 he stated that clarks run big and a   would fit better i picked out  shoes but the sales person brought out  pairs the first pair that he showed me was a pair that i did not ask for and that cost twice as much as the  that i asked to see at this point i was getting angry he then showed me the  pairs i asked for the first was a size  and the second was a   i asked why he brought out a  when he said i measured a   he then repeated that they run big needless to say that the  did not fit i then tried the   which felt snug the sales person stated that they would stretch i asked to see a 0 but he stated he did not have a 0 he didn’t even go to the back and check he kept saying they will stretch i purchased them thinking they would stretch and they did not now two of my toes have gone numb due to the uncomfortable clark shoes i purchased now i am being told i cannot exchange them for the size i originally asked for and now i have a pair of shoes that i cannot wear shoes that were expensive i will be suing and i have filed a complaint with the us attorney general’s office consumer protection division i am told by the agent that they will begin an investigation into this matter clarks boasts customer satisfaction but they don’t mean it it’s a shame i have to go through all of this especially when i just asked for an exchange i didn’t ask for a refund i will share my experience with every social media outlet so no one will have to go through the same experience especially having to experience numbness in the toes mrs geralyn breig boasts above strong company values but if you look at the many comments on the clarks corporate website you will find many dissatisfied customers who’s issues have been ignored by the clarks company i can tell you that clark shoes are very expensive and the average consumer works hard for their money most of them cannot afford to purchase clarks shoes and not be able to wear them due to them falling apart not being sold the correct size etc reply ↓ leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be
