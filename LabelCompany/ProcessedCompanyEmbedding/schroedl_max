statements we make todayill now turn the call over to jennifer cue chief executive officer of jones sodajennifer l cue jones soda co  ceo president and director thank you max and good afternoon everyone our first quarter of  was in line with our expectations and as a reminder to everyone last years first quarter contained a very large loadin of our first product line at eleven usa and into approximately  locations in that first quarter if we look beyond the large loadin during the first quarter of  our first quarter of  would have been the strongest first quarter since ive returned to jones sodafirst and fourth quarters have historically been the companys slowest selling periods in part because they occur during the colder seasons of the year during the first quarter of  we saw the velocity or take rates of select by jones at a much higher rate than the original pet version we attribute the much stronger acceptance of this second iteration of jones to the premium glass bottle as well as to having more joneslike flavorsin addition one of the  flavors in the lineup is sour patch watermelon which has quickly become one of the topselling flavors in the lineup just behind jones top seller berry lemonade we are pleased that eleven and our sales were able to pivot within  year to a product line that is more appealing to our consumers expectations we are currently working toward adding new flavors to the select by jones lineup and are planning new promotions for the lineup in the summer of  and out to read morein addition to the glass lineup at eleven we just announced the launch of one of our flavors green apple on fountain in elevens  pacific northwest locations and we look forward to continuing to build upon our partnership there with this product and potential followalong productsaside from our eleven partnership business in the first quarter of  there were a few other items such as timing of promotions or launching of skus that also impacted our first quarter  results we remain steadfast in our excitement about our future growth through new corporate retail and distributor partnerships coming onboard our initiatives of fountain in lemoncocco as well as our continued focus on developing unique and innovative new product which i will describe after max now goes over the numbers in more detailmax schroedl jones soda co  cfo thanks jennifer revenue in the first quarter of  decreased  to  million from  million in the comparable period the primary driver of the decrease was timing and price differences between the initial product launch of our cobranded eleven pet product and the relaunch of the cobranded eleven glass product the current cobranded glass product was launched during the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of  as compared to the significant pipeline fill of the pet cobranded product primarily in the first quarter of  other onetime factors including timing and sku selection contributed to a lesser extentpromotional allowances decreased  or  to  for the first quarter of  primarily due to onetime programs that were completed in  the accounting impact of these promotional allowances is a direct offset to gross revenuesgross profit margin in the first quarter of  decreased  from  in the first quarter of  primarily due to changes in the select program the new offering is in our iconic glass bottle which has a slightly higher cost than the previous product additionally the purchase price point to eleven is slightly lower to support this program even furthertotal operating expenses in the first quarter decreased to  million from  million in the prior year period operating expenses also included noncash expenses depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation totaling  compared to  last year operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to  for the first quarter of  from  during the same period in loss from operations for the first quarter of  was  compared to income from operations of  in the first quarter of  again largely driven by loaded differences in our cobranded select product line adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  was negative  compared to  in the first quarter of  again primarily due to revenue decrease related to the factors weve discussednet loss for the quarter ended mach   was  or  per share whereas the first quarter for  we had net income of  or  per shareturning now to our balance sheet as of march   we had working capital of  million and cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to working capital of  million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately  as of march   at this time we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our loan facility and anticipated cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through the end of  we may seek alternate forms of financing to fund new initiatives or accelerate growth of current initiativescash provided by operations during the first quarter of  was  compared to cash used in operations of  in q  the increase in cash from operations was driven by the timing of production and certain receivables during both years we utilized our assetbased loan facility for working capital needsat march   our eligible borrowing base was approximately  million of which we had drawn down  comparatively at december   we had drawn down  million on the loan facility and on march   we had drawn down  our current maximum aggregate amount available for borrowing under the loan facility is  millionill now turn the call back over to jennifer for final wrapupjennifer l cue jones soda co  ceo president and director thanks max to reiterate our plan for the future includes  initiatives jones lemoncocco and innovation with regards to jones we are seeing interest in premium sodas over mainstream brands in conjunction with this our fountain initiative remains a pivotable area  a pivotal area for growth within the jones soda umbrellaas demonstrated by our orange  cream flavor which debuted in november on slurpee in the pacific northwest elevens and the current launch of our green apple flavor on fountain in pacific northwest elevens we are excited by the opportunity of seeing jones products on fountain at conveniencein addition we are landing and garnering everincreasing interest from independent and regional restaurant chains with this in mind we will be profiling again our fountain program at the upcoming national restaurant association show in chicago this month as well as the national association of convenience stores show in chicago as well in octoberour second and increasingly exciting brand initiative is lemoncocco lemoncocco is an allnatural brand that was inspired by my own experiences in rome italy lemoncocco is one sku at this point and is a noncarbonated brand made with the cream of a coconut and sicilian lemons it is a great hydration beverage foodpairing beverage and is quickly becoming a great cocktail mixerlemoncocco is currently being rolled out beyond our initial launch markets of  which were the pacific northwest california and select markets such as montreal canada chicago and boston we are in the process of launching lemoncocco into new states such as utah colorado and arizona in the west additionally we are in the process of setting up a network of distributors for the new yorknew jersey market and just in time for the warm summer monthsand finally we are excited to have lassonde industries our longstanding canadian partner and single largest distributor of jones soda in our network become our master distributor for lemoncocco in canadawith our network growing we are also in the process of introducing the product to more retailers across north america while still a small part of our business every day we are seeing great signs of where the lemoncocco brand can go spins data which is the allnatural channel equivalent of nielsen data just showed lemoncocco growing in our original market of northern california at a rate in excess of  for the prior month period we are using this exciting data to secure retail partners for lemoncoccoand finally we look to product innovation as another avenue for growth for  and for our st year in business we are appropriately going to be launching an alcoholic brand in our home market in the upcoming weeks we are excited to be launching our firstever alcoholic brand as we turn  and appropriately named spiked jones spiked jones will be the firstever hard cider soda after  years on the market we want to offer our original jones fans who grew up on the soda and are now in their late s and s an alcoholic version of the brand they loved growing upwe will launch spiked jones with our longtime partner in our home market of the pacific northwest columbia distributing columbia is one of the nations largest alcoholic beverage distributors and has managed our jones soda brands since  we trust their knowledge of this business and will be very glad to work with them to manage the rollout in this new category for our companywe will be launching spiked jones specifically in our home market of the pacific northwest in  for our st birthday and we will gauge the success of this rollout into the alcoholic category along the way preparing a more broadscale launch in the future look for more product information and an official release from us soonand finally before opening the call up for questions i would like to thank mills brown one of our board members mills last board meeting was this past tuesday and on behalf of all shareholders i would like to thank him for all of his contributions over the past  years he was a key reason why  for why i returned to the company and i know mills will still play a key role as a very active shareholder moving forward we are currently evaluating new potential board members and we will look to add someone in the next yeari will now open the call up for questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions well go now to gary getz whos a private investorunidentified shareholder looking at the results i guess what impressed me more about the call was the looking forward and i did  things while you were talking i went to the eleven website and theyre featuring the new product on their website under thirsty and select beverages and the graphics look really goodjennifer l cue jones soda co  ceo president and director greatunidentified shareholder so hopefully theres potential there and ive got to give you credit for trying and what wasjennifer l cue jones soda co  ceo president and director yes i mean we have  just to follow along with that gary we have definitely with the rollout of the second version

investors by surprise was the spiked jonesjennifer l cue jones soda co  ceo president and director yesunidentified shareholder and i want to give you a lot of credit for the innovation and for pursuing that market i think theres a lot of potential there in the alcohol beverage marketjennifer l cue jones soda co  ceo president and director yes and i mean gary i give you some credit too actually youve said along the last few years youve asked me about different iterations of jones and so i was biting my tongue because i really  we trademarked spiked jones in  we always thought we wanted to do this and as were turning  it just makes the most sense it allows us to try to take this amazing brand and put it into a category that could deliver us a lot more potential than even say a premium soda category so we  im looking at the design of everything i cant wait to show it to you and we cant wait to roll it out in our home market and already were talking about beyond our home

connecting with consumers and we made a couple of tweaks to the packaging and the formulation and we are going out hard this year and super excited by the mass appeal of this brand it goes from age  to  its a mass appeal brand so yes were very excited with lemoncoccounidentified shareholder great well congratulations on hopefully a good future and as an investor i wanted to thank you very

jones soda co  cfo as we shifted product size from the previous iteration of select and now as were going into fountain and lemoncocco and our margins are changing we really felt that the case data
