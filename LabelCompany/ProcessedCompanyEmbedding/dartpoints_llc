announced the use of ensemble orchestrator and connector in dartpoints’ micro data center deployments this deployment is generating a lot of interest because it’s a bold use of network functions

adva bought overture networks one of the six companies who i believe has a fullspectrum nfv solution that can make a business case i was critical of the fact that they seemed to be positioning overture as a limited extension to the carrier ethernet business now they’ve made their positioning clearer with an announcement that dartpoints a supplier of onpremises microdatacenters has selected

difficult challenges that nfv in its vcpe guise faces is getting out of the cpe edge device and into the cloud the business case for deploying agile cpe is only slightly related to that of nfv and the technology for nfv is overkill if all your vnfs are going to do is squat in the customer edge device and wait to be changed around nfv technology is valuable when vnfs have to be more spread around
