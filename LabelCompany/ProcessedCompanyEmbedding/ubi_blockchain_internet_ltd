in the blockchain technology with a focus on the internet of things iot covering areas of food and drugs healthcare just to name a few the company will leverage the stock market to build a new business technology platform specialized in the safety and freshness keeping of food and drugs within the context of micro and macro environment of the human life   ubi plans to set up teams that are dedicated to blockchain application and research application of the internet of things it and data analytics in order to achieve its business goals   an internet of things is defined as the internetworking of physical devices vehicles also referred to as connected devices and smart devices buildings and other items embedded with electronics software sensors actuators and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data the iot allows objects to be sensed andor controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems and resulting in improved efficiency accuracy and economic benefit blockchain originally block chain is defined as  a distributed database that maintains a continuouslygrowing list of ordered records called blocks  each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block by design blockchains are resistant to modification of the data  once recorded the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively the company plans to develop and specialize in the design development promotion and sales of blockchain technology and internet of things   industry trends   recent advances in streamlining video monitoring sensors highspeed broadband internet introducing wireless standards such as bluetooth lowpower and other technologies have brought about the emergence of virtual transactions and investment plans that individuals and businesses can base on their spending habits to measure data that monitoring equipment and applications to receive realtime feedback and to fit a wide range of personal and corporate preferences for reliability at home                        blockchain techniques have shown considerable adaptability in recent years as various market sectors have sought to find ways of incorporating capabilities into their operations while most of the focus has so far been on financial services industry this has begun to change for example the use of blockchain technology to support digital electronic payments to counter counterfeit drugs in the pharmaceutical industry the adaptability of blockchain to a large number of applications has been one of the driving forces of the technologys growing interest in past few years as solution for organization and ledger needs the most recent market for blockchain technology is pharmaceutical industry   the use blockchain technology and internet of things is being employed to address universal healthcare industry regarding food and drug safety and labor relations management at present management believes that there exists confusion of chinese medicine industry including fake drugs bad medicine serious phenomenon no regulated production no guaranteed efficacy of traditional chinese medicine the excessive use of antibiotics poison capsules incidents vaccine cases ginkgo leaf licorice tablets and other major drug cases have seriously affected peoples physical and mental health therefore food and drug safety relates to vital interests of millions of peoples social problems from current safety issues of food and drug we see scientific and exact drug management issues   management believes that the blockchain technology and internet of things promote industrial information and emergence of possible technological solutions through integration of blockchain technology for the core of internet of things to establish a seamless industrial chain so as to achieve food and drug safety control and enterprise relations management internet of things is the extension and continuation of internet iot can increase the ubiquity of the internet by integrating every object for interaction via radio frequency identification rfid devices infrared sensors global positioning systems laser scanners and other information sensing equipment which leads to a highly distributed network of devices communicating with human beings as well as other devices iot is opening opportunities for a large number of novel applications that promise to improve quality of lives in recent years iot has connected with blockchain exchange and communication for intelligent identification location tracking monitoring and management of a network this technology is still in its infancy   a universal healthcare system covers all citizens seeking to achieve efficiencies by integrating the basic functions of healthcare delivery health insurance distribution of healthy food and drug safety and labor relations management based on the full integration of internet of things with blockchain technology this technology can change old systems blockchain technology is a distributed database that maintains a continuouslygrowing list of records called blocks each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block the data in a block cannot be altered retrospectively blockchain has characteristics such as decentrality openness and transparency autonomy security of information that cannot be tampered with and anonymity these features can strengthen solution to drug and food safety issues as well as getting more meaningful solution to enterprise labor relations management                    blockchain technologybased applications   management plans to focus its business in the integrated wellness industry which providing procedures for safety and effectiveness in food and drugs but also preventing counterfeit or fake food and drugs with the advancement of the blockchain technology we can trace a food or drug product all the way up to its original source within the context of the internet of things   we are in the early stages of blockchain technology which can store decentralized and distributed software ledger with complete transaction history blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications in addition to financial real estate back office systems and stock trading applications blockchain is a distributed ledger agreement that allows projects or transactions to be transparently registered and is first developed for use in a variety of industries to offer a wide range of services including banking stock trading real estate and even global diamond sales more and more financial giants join blockchain technology applications and research and development including ibm microsoft intel blockstream and thompson reuters to further accelerate blockchain technology as a maturity and development system management believes the investments in the field of blockchain are growing due to maturity and safety of blockchain technology it can play a role in many fields and management believes its application field and development potential offer a growth opportunity for the company   the five features of blockchain include decentralization openness autonomy nontampering and anonymity these features make blockchain an advantage in science and finance blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed ledger that allows each transaction to be recorded and verified by network which means that they do not need a central regulator such as a bank or financial institution transactions are also anonymous and theoretically realtime although recent network oversaturation has led to this problem the blockbased distributed accounting technology combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies makes it possible for billions of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security allowing virtual time travel and allowing regulators to return to the point at which the problem occurred one of potential application of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of iot devices and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions which can ultimately lead engineers and regulators to virtualize clock backwards at the same time blockchain technology can reduce audit costs reduce distrust of central node so that flow of financial assets is more transparent and convenient in fact current blockchain technology is indeed application of digital electronic payments to blockchain  transition extension from financial sector gradually to iot and other nonfinancial areas which will trigger more and greater industrial restructuring and revolution it is our time to enter real power blockchain technology                      the central concept and future development of blockchain are trends of things fit leading gradual selfgovernment of things blockchain technology is a good solution infrastructure investment high maintenance costs and data security issues blockchain technology support iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchain technology research and application will make iot networking shine blockchains pointtopoint communication platform gives a subtle solution blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server thus eliminating the need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in the network   internet of things iot is about creating digital representations of realworld objects it is a phenomenon that draws on rapid developments within it ict and telecommunications to spark insights and to help companies create entirely new types of services and business areas management believes that the internet of things will be the next technology to promote the rapid development of the worlds important productive forces   health care business focus   management believes that the global iot in healthcare market is growing at a significant growth rate due to increasing demand for advanced healthcare information system and growing prevalence of chronic and lifestyle associated diseases   the iot applications in healthcare such as telemedicine medication management clinical operations and workflow management inpatient monitoring helps in compiling services related to diagnosis treatment care and rehabilitation they improve communication between patients and healthcare providers in order to reduce medication errors and provide better coordinated care   blockchain technology supports iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchains pointtopoint communication platform problem gives a subtle solution blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server thus eliminating need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having to trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in network blockchain technology can also help solve medical field of data privacy and other issues such as custody of electronic medical records safe storage of genetic data drug security and so on                          the market opportunity   the company is in the early stages of blockchain technology which can store decentralized and distributed software ledger with complete transaction history blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications in addition to financial real estate and back office systems blockchain can be utlized as a distributed ledger agreement that allows projects or transactions to be transparently registered and can be used in a variety of industries to offer a wide range of services including banking stock trading real estate and even global diamond sales   blockchain technology can play a role in many fields blockcchain transactions are theoretically realtime the blockbased distributed accounting technology combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies makes it possible for countless of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security allowing technicians to return to the point at which the problem occurred one of potential applications of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of iot devices and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions which can ultimately lead engineers and technicians to virtualize clock backwards at the same time blockchain technology can reduce audit costs reduce distrust of central node so that flow of financial assets is more transparent and convenient in fact current blockchain technology is indeed application of digital electronic payments to block chain  transition extension from financial sector gradually to iot and other nonfinancial areas which will trigger more and greater industrial restructuring and revolution   the internet of things is based on computer science including network electronics radio frequency induction wireless artificial intelligence bar code cloud computing automation embedded technology as an integrated technology internet of things is called the third wave of the world information industry revolution after computer revolution and the second internet revolution management believes that within  years internet of things will be widely used in intelligent medicine intelligent transportation environmental protection government work public safety safety home intelligent home appliance industrial monitoring elderly care personal health intelligent building green agriculture and breeding surveillance imaging computers mobile phones and other fields   blockchain technology is a good solution for infrastructure investment high maintenance costs and data security issues blockchain technology supports iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchain technology research and application will make iot networking more efficient blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes

custody of electronic medical records safe storage of genetic data and drug security                our strategy   our strategy is to make ubi the premier online investment and communication platform in key markets in china and later on we may expand into europe and north america to achieve this goal we intend to do the following   • introducing innovative products   we plan to develop commercially applicable blockchain based payment and other functions such as product tracking we aim at satisfaction of user experience covering the consumption after sales    • create brand awareness and drive sales of our products and services in key markets   we intend to target our marketing efforts to create global awareness of our brand and drive sales of our products and services in the key markets of china    • employ professional investment professionals academics university professors and communication professionals   we plan to employ investment professionals academics university professors and communication professionals from around the world to develop technologies applications to human beings   • coordinate with strategic partners in each of the target markets for marketing and distribution   we believe that international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us and we intend to expand sales of our products and services globally through selected retailers and strategic partnerships we plan to work with key partners in the target markets to provide marketing and distribution expertise and assistance although it may be challenging to gain market acceptance in these markets we believe the assistance of such experts will expedite the process   competitive strengths   we believe that the following strengths position us to build our business model    building a creative commercial platform through independent design and development   we plan to make an integrated platform that incorporates the blockchain technology internet of things and a stock market this platform when built will support blockchain based payment the convenience of internet of things with the speed safety and convenience not yet experienced we plan to establish a brand name of “global ubi” for our products               we believe we have good relations in china’s healthcare industry   in china we believe that our management has good relations in the field of integrated health industry for scientific research and development raw material production base and other industrial chains our management is also familiar with the international pharmaceutical market and the food market we believe that technology is the top productive force the effective combination of blockchain technology and internet of things technology which exclude all possible human factors its centralization transparency and chain cannot be tampered with traceability etc can solve the drug and food safety issues   target market   at present fake drugs are common in china as there exists little regulation of production and no guaranteed efficacy of traditional chinese medicine there has been an excessive use of antibiotics poison capsules incidents vaccine cases ginkgo leaf licorice tablets and other major drug cases seriously affecting peoples physical and mental health therefore food and drug safety is related to the vital interests of millions of people in china   sources of income and pricing   we plan to use application of information technology it blockchain technology and iot technology that permeate virtually all aspects of corporate and social activity effective combination of food and drugs safety and management of labor relations the products and services enabled by it have had a major impact to the healthcare industry as we look to the future emerging technologies raise new trend in security law enforcement privacy safety in food and drug of healthcare industry   sales and marketing   the company plans to place an emphasis on social media for the marketing and advancement of blockchian internet of things and technological innovation platform as well as the traditional health application food and drug production process chain for more transparent transactions the company plans to implement original sources of procurement advantages and preferred overseas products for the domestic highend consumers we provide more efficient convenient and affordable imports of quality goods   management believes chinese consumers are more likely to consider buying a product if they see it mentioned on a socialmedia site and more likely to purchase a product or service if a friend or acquaintance recommends it on a socialmedia site   chinese consumers rely heavily upon peertopeer recommendations over general mass advertising in general the chinese populace is skeptical of information from news sources and advertising and rely more on wordofmouth from friends family and key opinion leaders many of whom share information on social media                  while messaging and sharing photos is as popular in china as in other regions one aspect of usage in the country stands out social media has a greater influence on purchasing decisions for consumers in china than for those anywhere else in the world due to the widespread use of social media in china the company will focus its marketing efforts on this medium the company will be present with its own social media site on the largest chinese social media platforms sale of products and services will take place on the portal with regards to north america and european market we anticipate employing a similar strategy our most important profit and revenue will come from our development of drugs food safety software and system platform technology to promote sales and transfer technology these software technologies and platform technologies will be widely used in health industry businesses and regulatory agencies   manufacturing   the company does not at this time engage in any manufacturing but may engage in manufacturing of products to be sold on the companys website in the future   government regulation   we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection data security data retention consumer protection advertising electronic commerce intellectual property manufacturing antibribery and anticorruption and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws   in particular there are numerous us federal state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy data security and data protection however given that the scope interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be conflicting it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices any failure or perceived failure to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacyrelated legal obligations by us or thirdparty serviceproviders or the failure or perceived failure by thirdparty apps with which our users choose to share their data to comply with their privacy policies or privacyrelated legal obligations as they relate to the data shared with them or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or negative publicity and could have an adverse effect on our brand and operating results              we plan to develop solutions to ensure that data transfers from the eu provide adequate protections to comply with the eu data protection directive if we fail to develop such alternative data transfer solutions one or more national data protection authorities in the european union could bring enforcement actions seeking to prohibit or suspend our data transfers to the us and we could also face additional legal liability fines negative publicity and resulting loss of business   governments are continuing to focus on privacy and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business any significant change to applicable laws regulations or industry practices regarding our users data could require us to modify our services and features possibly in a material manner and may limit our ability to develop new products services and features although we have made efforts to design our policies procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state federal and foreign laws changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight any of which could significantly increase our operating costs   the labeling distribution importation marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various us state and federal and foreign agencies including the cpsc federal trade commission food and drug administration or fda federal communications commission and state attorneys general as well as by various other federal state provincial local and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products and services are distributed or sold if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant monetary fines other penalties or claims which could harm our operating results or our ability to conduct our business   the global nature of our business operations also create various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subject us to laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions and our products are also subject to us export controls including the us department of commerces export administration regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury departments office of foreign assets controls if we become liable under these laws or regulations we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products or services which would negatively affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits regulatory proceedings and legislative proposals could harm our brand or otherwise impact the growth of our business any costs incurred as a result of compliance or other liabilities under these laws or regulations could harm our business and operating results                    employees   we have  fulltime employees within our workforce  employees are engaged in product development and  employees are engaged in business development finance human resources facilities information technology and general management and administration we expect the number of employees to rise to more than  by the end of december  we have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages we consider our relationship with our employees to be good                                            risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment you should read the section entitled “special note regarding forward looking statements” above for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report   risks related to our business   we have limited historical financial information upon which you may evaluate our performance   we have a limited operating history and we are subject to all risks inherent in a developing business enterprise our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with selling audio housing systems and the competitive environment in which we operate you should consider among other factors our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies that like us are in their early stages of research we may not be able to successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating and acquisition strategies if we fail to do so it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our preferred and common stock to the point that the investors may lose their entire investment even if we accomplish these objectives we may not be able to generate positive cash flows or profits that we anticipate in the future   our auditors have made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concer there is no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern   the financial statements included with our annual report for the year ended august   have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern our auditors have made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report on our audited financial statements for the year ended august   because the company has been issued an opinion by its auditors that substantial doubt exists as to whether the company can continue as a going concern it may be more difficult for the company to attract investors since our auditors have raised a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this typically results greater difficulty to obtain loans than businesses that do not have a qualified auditors opinion additionally any loans we might obtain may be on less advantageous terms our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from our business                  we plan to seek additional funds through private placements of our preferred and common stock you may be investing in a company that will not have the funds necessary to continue to deploy its business strategies if we are not able to achieve sufficient revenues or find financing to cover our expenses then we likely will be forced to cease operations and investors will likely lose their entire investment   we may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding which may be unavailable to us   we have prepared audited financial statements for the year end for august   for the period from inception august   through the year end for august   we experienced an operating net loss of   our ability to continue to operate as a going concern is fully dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient financing to continue its development and operational activities the ability to achieve profitable operations is in direct correlation to our ability to generate revenues or raise sufficient financing it is important to note that even if the appropriate financing is received there is no guarantee that we will ever be able to operate profitably or derive any significant revenues from its operation if we run out of cash reserves we would be forced to cease operations   no assurance can be given that the company will obtain access to capital markets in the future or that financing adequate to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies will be available on acceptable terms the inability of the company to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and upon its financial conditions   the nature of our operations are highly speculative   the success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations financial condition and management our business concept revolves around developing iot eblockchain and other technologies our business model is not yet established in the industry and we will have to convince our customers to use our products and services   management believes that we will be successful in marketing our services but there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract sufficient consumers to achieve profitability or even generate anything but minimal revenues if our services are not accepted by consumers we will fail                            we may not be able to compete with other companies some of whom have greater resources and experience   we do not have the resources to compete with larger providers of these similar services at this time with the limited if not minimal resources the company has available the company may experience great difficulties in building a customer base competition from existing and future competitors could result in the company’s inability to secure any new customers this competition from other entities with greater resources and reputations may result in the company’s failure to maintain or expand its business as the company may never be able to successfully execute its business plan further we cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors or that the competitive pressure it may face will not force the company to cease operations     we may be unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our products and services or establish a significant market presence   our growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to market our product successfully to prospective clients in the target markets which shall initially be china europe and the united states this requires that we heavily rely upon our development and marketing partners in the target markets failure to select the right development and marketing partners in the target markets and other target markets will significantly delay or prohibit our ability to develop the products and services market the products and gain market acceptance our products and services may not achieve significant acceptance such acceptance if achieved may not be sustained for any significant period of time failure of our services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and the results of our operations     if potential users within the target markets do not widely adopt online or ubi fails to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance we will not generate sufficient revenue and our growth prospects financial condition and results of operations could be harmed   ubi may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and therefore may never generate substantial revenue or allow us to achieve or maintain profitability widespread adoption of virtual and online training portals in the target markets depends on many factors including acceptance by users that such systems and methods or other options our ability to achieve commercial market acceptance for ubi or any other future products also depends on the strength of our sales marketing and distribution organizations                    we may not be able to attract qualified professionals academics university professors and communication professionals from around the world which will decrease the value of technological innovation platform offering and may make it difficult to differentiate ubi from other online services providers   our strategy includes developing relationships with professionals academics university professors and communication professionals from around the world if we are unable to establish relationships with these professionals academics university professors and communication professionals that ubis technological innovation platform is not effective or that alternative products are more effective or if we encounter difficulty promoting adoption or establishing ubi as a standard our ability to achieve market acceptance of ubi could be significantly limited     we may not be able to develop new products or enhance the capabilities of ubi to keep pace with our industrys rapidly changing technology and customer requirements   the industry for blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes new product introductions enhancements and evolving industry standards our business prospects depend on our ability to develop new products and applications for our technology in new markets that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances while improving the performance and costeffectiveness new technologies techniques or products could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than ubi systems the market for online or virtual healthcare market is characterized by rapid innovation and advancement in technology it is important that we anticipate changes in technology and market demand if we do not successfully innovate and introduce new technology into our anticipated product lines or effectively manage the transitions of our technology to new product offerings our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed     cyber security risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations   the threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches our devices as well as our servers computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cyber security risks including cyber attacks such as viruses and worms phishing attacks denialofservice attacks physical or electronic breakins employee theft or misuse and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations which could lead to interruptions delays loss of critical data and loss of consumer confidence                in addition we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks any cyber attack that attempts to obtain our data and assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation   our financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies   our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of our foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads us to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for our products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons we may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the strengthening of the us dollar or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to our foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause us to reduce international pricing incur losses on our foreign currency derivative instruments and incur increased operating expenses thereby limiting any benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase our cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins   we do not use derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates     we may acquire other businesses form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results dilute our stockholders ownership increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense   we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets we also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our proprietary technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution we have no experience with acquiring other companies and limited experience with forming strategic partnerships we may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms if at all if we make any acquisitions we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities                any future acquisitions also could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or future writeoffs of intangible assets or goodwill any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that we would otherwise focus on developing our existing business we may experience losses related to investments in other companies which could harm our financial condition and results of operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition strategic alliance or joint venture   foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries   to finance any acquisitions or joint ventures we may choose to issue shares of common stock as consideration which could dilute the ownership of our stockholders additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all if the price of our common stock is low or volatile we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration    risks related to our reliance on third parties   we will depend on thirdparties to market in international markets   we will depend on a number of third parties to market and sell internationally we may not be able to successfully identify marketing and distribution partners and even if we do such parties may not be able to successfully market and sell and may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts that enable the product to develop achieve or sustain market acceptance any of these factors could reduce our revenue from affected international markets increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation in addition if we are unable to attract additional international distributors our international revenue may not grow                                    risks related to being a public company   our management team has no experience managing a public company   most members of our management team have no experience managing a publiclytraded company interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors these new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the daytoday management of our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results   if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and as a result investors may be misled and lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and the price of our preferred and common stock may be negatively affected   the sarbanesoxley act of  requires that we report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting a significant deficiency means a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the companys financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   as of august   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives   in addition in connection with our ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we may discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as defined in standards established by the public company accounting oversight board or the pcaob a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected            failure to provide effective internal controls may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the price of our preferred and common stock moreover effective internal controls are necessary to produce accurate reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud if we have deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting these deficiencies may negatively impact our business and operations     risks related to administrative organizational and commercial operations and growth   the loss of our chief executive officer or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled developers and other personnel could negatively impact our business   our success depends on the skills experience and performance of tony liu our chief executive officer and other key employees the individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop and as we expand our commercial activities the loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could negatively impact our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors our executive officers have employment agreements however the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee the retention of the executive officer for any period of time     our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation   a portion of the technologies we use incorporates open source software and we may incorporate open source software in the future such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses these licenses may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions including requirements that we offer our products and services that incorporate the open source software for no cost that we make publicly available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license additionally if a thirdparty software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider we could be required to disclose or provide at no cost any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed software if an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the applicable license we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages and enjoined from the sale of our products and services that contained the open source software any of the foregoing could disrupt the distribution and sale of our products and services and harm our business              risks related to intellectual property   if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position could be harmed   we plan to rely upon patents trademarks copyright and trade secret protection as well as nondisclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and third parties to protect our confidential and proprietary information significant elements of our products and services are based on unpatented trade secrets and knowhow that are not publicly disclosed in addition to contractual measures we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures such measures may not for example in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access provide adequate protection for our proprietary information our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult expensive and timeconsuming and the outcome is unpredictable in addition trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us if any of our confidential or proprietary information such as our trade secrets were to be disclosed or misappropriated or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor our competitive position could be harmed     we may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our products   our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties for example there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products infringe there also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe but that we may ultimately be found to infringe moreover patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed because patents can take many years to issue there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe for example pending applications may exist that provide support or can be amended to provide support for a claim that results in an issued patent that our product infringes                    our software is built upon opensourced code and platforms nevertheless there is a risk a third party may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization if a court held that any thirdparty patents are valid enforceable and cover our products or their use the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our products unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire we may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us   risks related to ownership of our common stock   the price of our common stock may be volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control    factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include but are not limited to   ·      actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results ·      actual or anticipated changes in our growth

earthquakes tornadoes or other natural disasters and ·         issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations regarding us   in addition the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer these broad market fluctuations may negatively impact the price or liquidity of our common stock in the past when the price of a stock has been volatile holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer if any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business                        ubi

to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered

companys need for capital may change dramatically if it can generate additional revenues from its operations there are no assurances additional capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms   future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financial condition any future acquisitions of other businesses technologies services or products might require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing which might not be available on terms favorable to the company or at all and such financing if available might be dilutive   going concern   the company has an accumulated deficit since inception of  the company has not generated any meaningful revenues to date and its ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the company in october  there was a change in control of the company   these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   liquidity and capital resources   as of august   the company had no assets but had current liabilities of    the company has limited financial resources available which has had an adverse impact on the companys liquidity activities and operations these limitations have adversely affected the companys ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business the ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought no assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable to the company or at all                        offbalance sheet

registrant has no standing audit nominating and compensation committees of the board of directors or committees performing similar functions the board acts itself in lieu of committees due to its small size    the view of the board of directors is that it is appropriate for the registrant not to have such a committee because its directors participate in the consideration of director nominees and the board and the company are so small    the members of the board who acts as nominating committee is not independent pursuant to the definition of independence of a national securities exchange registered pursuant to section a of the act  usc fa    the nominating committee has no policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by security holders but the committee will consider director candidates recommended by security holders    the basis for the view of the board of directors that it is appropriate for the registrant not to have such a policy is that there is no need to adopt a policy for a small company    the nominating committee will consider candidates recommended by security holders and by security holders in submitting such recommendations    there are no specific minimum qualifications that the nominating committee believes must be met by a nominee recommended by security holders except to find anyone willing to serve

description ubi blockchain internets business encompasses the research and application in the blockchain technology with a focus on the internet of things iot covering areas of food and drugs healthcare just to name a few the company will leverage the stock market to build a new business technology platform specialized in the safety and freshness keeping of food and drugs within the context of micro and macro environment of the human life ubi plans to set up teams that are dedicated to blockchain application and research application of the internet of things it and data analytics in order to achieve its business goals an internet of things is defined as the internetworking of physical devices vehicles also referred to as connected devices and smart devices buildings and other items embedded with electronics software sensors actuators and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data the iot allows objects to be sensed andor controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems and resulting in improved efficiency accuracy and economic benefit blockchain originally block chain is defined asa distributed database that maintains a continuouslygrowing list of ordered records called blocks each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block by design blockchains are resistant to modification of the data  once recorded the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively the company plans to develop and specialize in the design development promotion and sales of blockchain technology and internet of things blockchain technologybased applications management plans to focus its business in the integrated wellness industry which providing procedures for safety and effectiveness in food and drugs but also preventing counterfeit or fake food and drugs with the advancement of the blockchain technology we can trace a food or drug product all the way up to its original source within the context of the internet of things we are in the early stages of blockchain technology which can store decentralized and distributed software ledger with complete transaction history blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications in addition to financial real estate back office systems and stock trading applications blockchain is a distributed ledger agreement that allows projects or transactions to be transparently registered and is first developed for use in a variety of industries to offer a wide range of services including banking stock trading real estate and even global diamond sales more and more financial giants join blockchain technology applications and research and development including ibm microsoft intel blockstream and thompson reuters to further accelerate blockchain technology as a maturity and development system management believes the investments in the field of blockchain are growing due to maturity and safety of blockchain technology it can play a role in many fields and management believes its application field and development potential offer a growth opportunity for the company the five features of blockchain include decentralization openness autonomy nontampering and anonymity these features make blockchain an advantage in science and finance blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed ledger that allows each transaction to be recorded and verified by network which means that they do not need a central regulator such as a bank or financial institution transactions are also anonymous and theoretically realtime although recent network oversaturation has led to this problem the blockbased distributed accounting technology combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies makes it possible for billions of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security allowing virtual time travel and allowing regulators to return to the point at which the problem occurred one of potential application of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of iot devices and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions which can ultimately lead engineers and regulators to virtualize clock backwards at the same time blockchain technology can reduce audit costs reduce distrust of central node so that flow of financial assets is more transparent and convenient in fact current blockchain technology is indeed application of digital electronic payments to blockchain the central concept and future development of blockchain are trends of things fit leading gradual selfgovernment of things blockchain technology is a good solution infrastructure investment high maintenance costs and data security issues blockchain technology support iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchain technology research and application will make iot networking shine blockchains pointtopoint communication platform gives a subtle solution blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server thus eliminate the need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in the network internet of things iot is about creating digital representations of realworld objects it is a phenomenon that draws on rapid developments within it ict and telecommunications to spark insights and to help companies create entirely new types of services and business areas management believes that the internet of things will be the next technology to promote the rapid development of the worlds important productive forces health care business focus management believes that the global iot in healthcare market is growing at a significant growth rate due to increasing demand for advanced healthcare information system and growing prevalence of chronic and lifestyle associated diseases the iot applications in healthcare such as telemedicine medication management clinical operations and workflow management inpatient monitoring helps in compiling services related to diagnosis treatment care and rehabilitation they improve communication between patients and healthcare providers in order to reduce medication errors and provide better coordinated care blockchain technology supports iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchains pointtopoint communication platform problem gives a subtle solution blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server thus eliminating need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having to trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in network blockchain technology can also help solve medical field of data privacy and other issues such as custody of electronic medical records safe storage of genetic data drug security and so on the market opportunity the company is in the early stages of blockchain technology which can store decentralized and distributed software ledger with complete transaction history blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications in addition to financial real estate and back office systems blockchain can be utlized as a distributed ledger agreement that allows projects or transactions to be transparently registered and can be used in a variety of industries to offer a wide range of services including banking stock trading real estate and even global diamond sales blockchain technology can play a role in many fields blockchain transactions are theoretically realtime the blockbased distributed accounting technology combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies makes it possible for countless of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security allowing technicians to return to the point at which the problem occurred one of potential applications of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of iot devices and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions

familiar with the international pharmaceutical market and the food market we believe that technology is the top productive force the effective combination of blockchain technology and internet of things technology which exclude all possible human factors its centralization transparency and chain cannot be tampered with traceability etc can solve the drug and food safety issues target market at present fake drugs are common in china as there exists little regulation of production and no guaranteed efficacy of traditional chinese medicine there has been an excessive use of antibiotics poison capsules incidents vaccine cases ginkgo leaf licorice tablets and other major drug cases seriously affecting peoples physical and mental health therefore food and drug safety is related to the vital interests of millions of people in china sources of income and pricing we plan to use application of information technology it blockchain technology and iot technology that permeate virtually all aspects of corporate and social activity effective combination of food and drugs safety and management of labor relations the products and services enabled by it have had a major impact to the healthcare industry as we look to the future emerging technologies raise new trend in security law enforcement privacy safety in food and drug of healthcare industry sales and marketing the company plans to place an emphasis on social media for the marketing and advancement of blockchain internet of things and technological innovation platform as well as the traditional health application food and drug production process chain for more transparent transactions the company plans to implement original sources of procurement advantages and preferred overseas products for the domestic highend consumers we provide more efficient convenient and affordable imports of quality goods management believes chinese consumers are more likely to consider buying a product if they see it mentioned on a socialmedia site and more likely to purchase a product or service if a friend or acquaintance recommends it on a socialmedia site chinese consumers rely heavily upon peertopeer recommendations over general mass advertising in general the chinese populace is skeptical of information from news sources and advertising and rely more on wordofmouth from friends family and key opinion leaders many of whom share information on social media while messaging and sharing photos is as popular in china as in other regions one aspect of usage in the country stands out social media has a greater influence on purchasing decisions for consumers in china than for those anywhere else in the world due to the widespread use of social media in china the company will focus its marketing efforts on this medium the company will be present with its own social media site on the largest chinese social media platforms sale of products and services will take place on the portal with regards to north america and european market we anticipate employing a similar strategy our most important profit and revenue will come from our development of drugs food safety software and system platform technology to promote

fever by jermaine farmer  may   share facebook twitter ubi blockchain internet ltd otcbbubia is an interesting play in the blockchain space think bitcoin that just doubled in price on a major jump in volume however while the move looks like a big deal it’s extremely important to appreciate the float in play in this stock just k shares i don’t think i’ve ever come across a stock with a float that tight not by a long shot if you breathe on this stock’s chart it moves a buck it’s light as a feather so wednesday’s move doesn’t actually imply a whole lot of new buying interest at all that said it’s an important move in all we’ve witnessed nearly  added to share values of the company over the past week of action but that move comes in the context of a larger bearish trend however ubia has evidenced sudden upward volatility on many prior occasions moreover the name has seen interest climb with an increase in recent trading volume of topping  above the average volume levels in play in this stock over the longer term this should not be overlooked given the stock’s very limited trading float of k shares as noted above ubi blockchain internet ltd otcbbubia promulgates itself as a company with a business that encompasses the research and application in blockchain technology with a focus on the internet of things covering areas of food drugs and healthcare management plans to focus its business in the integrated wellness industry by providing procedures for safety and effectiveness in food and drugs but also preventing counterfeit or fake food and drugs with the advancement of the blockchain technology the company plans to trace a food or drug product from its original source within the context of the internet of things to the final consumer find out when ubia stock reaches critical levels subscribe to oracledispatchcom right now by entering your email in the box below the catalyst for the move is the explosion higher in bitcoin prices as the world finally starts to seriously wake up and get into mania mode on the digital currency and blockchainrelated market plays with a float of k shares as we noted above this stock simply can’t handle any kind of an influx of interest without going into orbit in short it would appear that ubia is pin action on the parabolic rise in bitcoin other than the gigantic spike in bitcoin the only important recent catalyst that we could find on the stock is an k filed about a week ago that points to an acquisition by the company of a chinese listed stock on may   the board of directors the “board” of ubi

focus on the internet of things iot covering areas of food and drugs healthcare just to name a few the company will leverage the stock market to build a new business technology platform specialized in the safety and freshness keeping of food and drugs within the context of micro and macro environment of the human life ubi plans to set up teams that are dedicated to blockchain application and research application of the internet of things it and data analytics in order to achieve its business goals an internet of things is defined as the internetworking of physical devices vehicles also referred to as connected devices and smart devices buildings and other items embedded with electronics software sensors actuators and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data the iot allows objects to be sensed andor controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems and resulting in improved efficiency accuracy and economic benefit blockchain originally block chain is defined as a distributed database that maintains a continuouslygrowing list of ordered records called blocks each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block by design blockchains are resistant to modification of the data  once recorded the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively the company plans to develop and specialize in the design development promotion and sales of blockchain technology and internet of things blockchain technologybased applications management plans to focus its business in the integrated wellness industry which providing procedures for safety and effectiveness in food and drugs but also preventing counterfeit or fake food and drugs with the advancement of the blockchain technology we can trace a food or drug product all the way up to its original source within the context of the internet of things we are in the early stages of blockchain technology which can store decentralized and distributed software ledger with complete transaction history blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications in addition to financial real estate back office systems and stock trading applications blockchain is a distributed ledger agreement that allows projects or transactions to be transparently registered and is first developed for use in a variety of industries to offer a wide range of services including banking stock trading real estate and even global diamond sales more and more financial giants join blockchain technology applications and research and development including ibm microsoft intel blockstream and thompson reuters to further accelerate blockchain technology as a maturity and development system management believes the investments in the field of blockchain are growing due to maturity and safety of blockchain technology it can play a role in many fields and management believes its application field and development potential offer a growth opportunity for the company  the five features of blockchain include decentralization openness autonomy nontampering and anonymity these features make blockchain an advantage in science and finance blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed ledger that allows each transaction to be recorded and verified by network which means that they do not need a central regulator such as a bank or financial institution transactions are also anonymous and theoretically realtime although recent network oversaturation has led to this problem the blockbased distributed accounting technology combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies makes it possible for billions of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security allowing virtual time travel and allowing regulators to return to the point at which the problem occurred one of potential application of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of iot devices and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions which can ultimately lead engineers and regulators to virtualize clock backwards at the same time blockchain technology can reduce audit costs reduce distrust of central node so that flow of financial assets is more transparent and convenient in fact current blockchain technology is indeed application of digital electronic payments to blockchain  transition extension from financial sector gradually to iot and other nonfinancial areas which will trigger more and greater industrial restructuring and revolution it is our time to enter real power blockchain technology the central concept and future development of blockchain are trends of things fit leading gradual selfgovernment of things blockchain technology is a good solution infrastructure investment high maintenance costs and data security issues blockchain technology support iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchain technology research and application will make iot networking shine blockchains pointtopoint communication platform gives a subtle solution blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server thus eliminate the need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in the network internet of things iot is about creating digital representations of realworld objects it is a phenomenon that draws on rapid developments within it ict and telecommunications to spark insights and to help companies create entirely new types of services and business areas management believes that the internet of things will be the next technology to promote the rapid development of the worlds important productive forces health care business focus management believes that the global iot in healthcare market is growing at a significant growth rate due to increasing demand for advanced healthcare information system and growing prevalence of chronic and lifestyle associated diseases the iot applications in healthcare such as telemedicine medication management clinical operations and workflow management inpatient monitoring helps in compiling services related to diagnosis treatment care and rehabilitation they improve communication between patients and healthcare providers in order to reduce medication errors and provide better coordinated care  blockchain technology supports iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchains pointtopoint communication platform problem gives a subtle solution blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server thus eliminating need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having to trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in network blockchain technology can also help solve medical field of data privacy and other issues such as custody of electronic medical records safe storage of genetic data drug security and so on the market opportunity the company is in the early stages of blockchain technology which can store decentralized and distributed software ledger with complete transaction history blockchain technology has a wide range of potential applications in addition to financial real estate and back office systems blockchain can be utlized as a distributed ledger agreement that allows projects or transactions to be transparently registered and can be used in a variety of industries to offer a wide range of services including banking stock trading real estate and even global diamond sales blockchain technology can play a role in many fields blockchain transactions are theoretically realtime the blockbased distributed accounting technology combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies makes it possible for countless of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security allowing technicians to return to the point at which the problem occurred one of potential applications of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of iot devices and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions which can ultimately lead engineers and technicians to virtualize clock backwards at the same time blockchain technology can reduce audit costs reduce distrust of central node so that flow of financial assets is more transparent and convenient in fact current blockchain technology is indeed application of digital electronic payments to block chain  transition extension from financial sector gradually to iot and other nonfinancial areas which will trigger more and greater industrial restructuring and revolution the internet of things is based on computer science including network electronics radio frequency induction wireless artificial intelligence bar code cloud computing automation embedded technology as an integrated technology internet of things is called the third wave of the world information industry revolution after computer revolution and the second internet revolution management believes that within  years internet of things will be widely used in intelligent medicine intelligent transportation environmental protection government work public safety safety home intelligent home appliance industrial monitoring elderly care personal health intelligent building green agriculture and breeding surveillance imaging computers mobile phones and other fields  blockchain technology is a good solution for infrastructure investment high maintenance costs and data security issues blockchain technology supports iot which is an extension and more advanced stage of internet blockchain technology research and application will make iot networking more efficient blockchain technology creates a shared distributed digital book between network nodes to record transactions rather than storing them on a central server this eliminates the need for central verification it provides a way to create a consensus network without having to trust a single node and data store does not need to be stored in a central server but by sharing it to all nodes in network blockchain technology can also solve medical field of data privacy and other issues such as custody of electronic medical records safe storage of genetic data and drug security our strategy our strategy is to make ubi the premier online investment and communication platform in key markets in china and later on we may expand into europe and north america to achieve this goal we intend to do the following • introducing innovative products we plan to develop commercially applicable blockchain based payment and other functions such as product tracking we aim at satisfaction of user experience covering the consumption after sales • create brand awareness and drive sales of our products and services in key markets we intend to target our marketing efforts to create global awareness of our brand and drive sales of our products and services in the key markets of china • employ professional investment professionals academics university professors and communication professionals we plan to employ investment professionals academics university professors and communication professionals from around the world to develop technologies applications to human beings • coordinate with strategic partners in each of the target markets for marketing and distribution we believe that international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us and we intend to expand sales of our products and services globally through selected retailers and strategic partnerships we plan to work with key partners in the target markets to provide marketing and distribution expertise and assistance although it may be challenging to gain market acceptance in these markets we believe the assistance of such experts will expedite the process  competitive strengths we believe that the following strengths position us to build our business model  building a creative commercial platform through independent design and development we plan to make an integrated platform that incorporates the blockchain technology internet of things and a stock market this platform when once built will support blockchain based payment the convenience of internet of things with the speed safety and convenience not yet experienced we plan to establish a brand name of global ubi for our products  we believe we have good relations in chinas healthcare industry in china we believe that our management has good relations in the field of integrated health industry for scientific research and development raw material production base and other industrial chains our management is also familiar with the international pharmaceutical market and the food market we believe that technology is the top productive force the effective combination of blockchain technology and internet of things technology which exclude all possible human factors its centralization transparency and chain cannot be tampered with traceability etc can solve the drug and food safety issues target market at present fake drugs are common in china as there exists little regulation of production and no guaranteed efficacy of traditional chinese medicine there has been an excessive use of antibiotics poison capsules incidents vaccine cases ginkgo leaf licorice tablets and other major drug cases seriously affecting peoples physical and mental health therefore food and drug safety is related to the vital interests of millions of people in china sources of income and pricing we plan to use application of information technology it blockchain technology and iot technology that permeate virtually all aspects of corporate and social activity effective combination of food and drugs safety and management of labor relations the products and services enabled by it have had a major impact to the healthcare industry as we look to the future emerging technologies raise new trend in security law enforcement privacy safety in food and drug of healthcare industry  sales and marketing the company plans to place an emphasis on social media for the marketing and advancement of blockchain internet of things and technological innovation platform as well as the traditional health application food and drug production process chain for more transparent transactions the company plans to implement original sources of procurement advantages and preferred overseas products for the domestic highend consumers we provide more efficient convenient and affordable imports of quality goods management believes chinese consumers are more likely to consider buying a product if they see it mentioned on a socialmedia site and more likely to purchase a product or service if a friend or acquaintance recommends it on a socialmedia site chinese consumers rely heavily upon peertopeer recommendations over general mass advertising in general the chinese populace is skeptical of information from news sources and advertising and rely more on wordofmouth from friends family and key opinion leaders many of whom share information on social media while messaging and sharing photos is as popular in china as in other regions one aspect of usage in the country stands out social media has a greater influence on purchasing decisions for consumers in china than for those anywhere else in the world due to the widespread use of social media in china the company will focus its marketing efforts on this medium the company will be present with its own social media site on the largest chinese social media platforms sale of products and services will take place on the portal with regards to north america and european market we anticipate employing a similar strategy our most important profit and revenue will come from our development of drugs food safety software and system platform technology to promote sales and transfer technology these software technologies and platform technologies will be widely used in health industry businesses and regulatory agencies manufacturing the company does not at this time engage in any manufacturing but may engage in
