however the ability to trade securities may be impacted by market events beyond our control such as when the markets closed following the hurricane sandy on october th  in creating our bcp we have assumed that the designated offsite locations are available that we have sufficient personnel and that external organizations such as government agencies and market systems are operational if any of these assumptions is in error our business could be disrupted until matters are resolved while no contingency plan can eliminate all risk of service interruption or temporarily impeded account access we continually assess and update our plans to mitigate all reasonable risk for more information our bcp is regularly tested to help ensure its adequacy and effectiveness and is subject to change

the etns in whole but not in part at its sole discretion and without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until and including maturity the payment on the etns is linked to the vwap level not to the closing level of the index and not to the published intraday indicative value of the etns your payment at maturity or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the vwap level as compared to the initial vwap level although the vwap level is intended to track the performance of the index the calculation of the vwap level is different from the calculation of the official closing level of the index therefore the payment at maturity or early redemption of your etns may be different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by reference to the official closing level of the index no guaranteed coupon payments you are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the etns you will receive a coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation date the amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior to the relevant coupon valuation date market and volatility risk the return on the etns is linked to the performance of the vwap level of the index which in turn is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time the prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and as a result affect the level of the index and the value of your etns in unforeseeable ways concentration risk the index constituents are companies in the midstream oil  gas and liquid petroleum and natural gas shippers categories as determined by the bloomberg industry classification system® bcis in addition many of the index constituents are smaller nondiversified businesses that are exposed to the risks associated with such businesses including the lack of capital funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger better financed and more diversified businesses the etns are susceptible to general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy business mlp market and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions regarding the index constituents change your investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities investment in one industry or sector a trading market for the etns may not develop although the etns are listed on a us national securities exchange a trading market for the etns may not develop and the liquidity of the etns may be limited as we are not required to maintain any listing of the etns restrictions on the minimum number of etns and date restrictions for redemptions you must redeem at least  etns at one time in order to exercise your right to redeem your etns on any redemption date you may only redeem your etns
