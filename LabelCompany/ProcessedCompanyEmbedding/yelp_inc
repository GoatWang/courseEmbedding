accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial in early  a classaction lawsuit was filed against yelp alleging it asked a long beach veterinary hospital to pay  a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews the following month nine additional businesses joined the classaction lawsuit and two similar lawsuits were filed that may the lawsuits were combined into one classaction lawsuit which was dismissed by san francisco us district judge edward chen in  chen said the reviews were protected by the communications decency act of  and that there was no evidence of manipulation by yelp the plaintiffs filed an appeal in september  the ninth us circuit
