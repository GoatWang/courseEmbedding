in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing the nasdaq rules provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including  or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations based on current interest rates we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes if any the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will enter into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial support beginning with the closing of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering our sponsor may loan us up to an aggregate of  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering these loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules any such purchases will be reported pursuant to section  and section  of the exchange act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholder has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on may   as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses we refer to such a business combination throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to this offering we have not identified any acquisition target we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any discussions directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any acquisition target we have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination we currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses which provide services to the healthcare industry with particular emphasis on businesses that align with several key themes the aging of america and the growing need for better more efficient care for the elderly the shift from feeforservice to value based care payment models and the increasing importance and involvement of consumers in healthcare we are not however required to complete our initial business combination with a healthcare services business and as a result we may pursue a business combination outside of that industry we will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial operational strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value we do not intend to acquire

allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for

incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment

offering the proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we expect that the interest earned on funds placed in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes if any until the earlier of i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or iii the redemption of  of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to the requirements of law the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team in an amount not to exceed  per month in the event such space andor services are utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of december   or the closing of this offering the loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans each warrant would be exercisable for onehalf of one class a ordinary share warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of class a ordinary shares no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants if upon exercise of the warrants a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share we will upon exercise round down to the nearest whole number the number of class a ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder as a result warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest that will not be issued if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our initial shareholders directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however other than as expressly stated herein they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions none of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transaction if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules subsequent to the consummation of this offering we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to i refrain from purchasing our securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and ii clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution we cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a rule b plan as it will be dependent upon several factors including but not limited to the timing and size of such purchases depending on such circumstances our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a rule b plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary the purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met the purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible in addition if such purchases are made the public “float” of our class a ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those class a ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a cayman islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger share exchange asset acquisition share purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not selected any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any business combination target we will seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing investing and operating expertise
