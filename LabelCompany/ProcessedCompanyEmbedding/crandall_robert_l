there at the top along with herb kelleher and for a decade gordon bethune it was my fortune to cover all three crandall and kelleher more so than bethunebob crandall was president of american airlines for  years from  to  and chief executive officer for  years from  to i covered him for the last eight years of his time at american it was not the best eight years for him or american particularly from  through consider that before i began covering aviation on oct   american under crandall had initiated the aadvantage frequentflier program an industryleading program that everyone else had to copy created revenue management systems to extract the maximum from each ticket sold an industryleading program that everyone else had to copy created the “bscale” a lower pay scale for new pilots that helped fund more growth and a strategy that a number of airlines had to copy embarked on the “growth plan” that saw american more than double in size between  and  added hubs in nashville tenn san jose calif miami fla san juan puerto rico and raleighdurham nc bought californiabased air cal to boost its west coast performance and presence piled up seven straight years of profits from  through  and was profitable through the first nine months of  for that period from  through sept    billion in net incomethat’s quite a list of accomplishments after i arrived though the airline posted  billion in net losses from fourth quarter  through  worst in the airline’s history to that point it closed its justopened hubs in nashville san jose and raleighdurham everyone else closed the gap or caught up on revenue management it abandoned the growth plan and over time was forced by its unions to do away with the bscale pay rates american’s simplified system of fares called “value pricing” flopped terribly after their april  introduction and helped worsen the industry losses that year northwest airlines and continental airlines sued american over value pricing and its aftermath american airlines won the case the carrier endured a fiveday strike by flight attendants in  and a minute strike by pilots in  american and its sabre unit had to abandon a reservations project confirm rs with several car rental firms and hotel companies in  enduring both embarrassment and losses that eventually exceeded  million related to the project and ensuring litigationso if crandall wasn’t in a good mood many of the times i saw him it was understandable by the time that crandall retired in  the ship had been righted and american was five years into the most profitable period in its history from  through crandall had to have been the most driven person i’ve covered and he gladly admitted that he was driven he summed up his approach to life as he talked to a group of travel executives at a dallas conference in “in times past reporters sometimes would say to me ‘have you had a balanced life’ i said no i haven’t had a balanced life and i didn’t want a balanced life i wanted a successful life i had a wife who took care of the balance of life” crandall said“i went to work early and i got home late and i worked most weekends that’s what i wanted to do because i really wanted to be successful and i was pretty brave i said things that needed to be said and i got very very angry if i ever lost”on weekends he’d go to work and leave notes on other executives’ desks along the lines of “i was here where were you”in his  book hard landing journalist tom petzinger called crandall “the most feared and powerful man in the global airline industry his very appearance intimidated people”crandall embraced a concept of “competitive anger” in his management at amr and american an idea he explained in a  deposition that was part of a us justice department lawsuit against american“our view was that it was very important for american to prevail and that as a consequence in order to prevail in a very competitive industry it was necessary to look at business as a contest” he said in the deposition“if you’re going to have a contest and you’re going to prevail you ought to be angry at your opponent and you ought to be angry with yourself if you don’t win”when northwest and continental sued american in  they introduced into evidence a  aa memo about ailing pan american world airways with a notation from crandall in the margins crush these guysunder crandall’s direction american created a hub at dallasfort worth regional airport in the early s stepping in just as braniff airways was weakening its hub operations in favor of more pointtopoint flyingin may  braniff stopped flying as it ran low on cash while braniff supporters blamed american for braniff’s demise crandall insisted that braniff was doomed by its own poor management decisions“we didnt cheat or play dirty in any way” crandall growled in a  interview “we came down here and we flew our airplanes braniff destroyed itself people who refuse to understand the facts who refuse to study the facts who do not know the facts are nevertheless entitled to mistaken opinions”in the low point of his career crandall suggested during a february  telephone conversation with braniff chief executive howard putnam that they should raise their fares by  percent it was a low point because putnam secretly taped the call and gave it to federal authoritiesus prosecutors later accused of crandall of violating federal antitrust laws in a  settlement crandall admitted no liability but agreed not to discuss fares with competitors for five years unless american was setting up joint fares with another carriercrandall understandably is touchy about that putnam conversation in  i wrote a story about how delta air lines was picking up market share at dfw airport at the expense of american american had pulled down capacity there in early  as some pilots staged a slowdown during prolonged contract talksat the insistence of an editor i included a quote from the putnam conversation in which crandall told putnam “we can both live here and there aint no room for delta”not long later the food chains at american and the dallas morning news was having one of its periodic dinners – i was the amoeba at the bottom of our food chain – when suddenly i heard crandall roar from the other end of the table something along the lines of “how much longer am i going to have to read about the putnam conversation” expletives deletedwell i don’t know maybe forever in any case he wasn’t pleaseda story involving delta also prompted crandall to issue an order in late april  banning all american airlines employees from talking to mei had gone to cover the harvard club of dallas’ ceremonies honoring herb kelleher as its man of the year crandall a close friend as well as fierce competitor was to introduce kelleherthe harvard club hosted kelleher for a press conference prior to a reception and dinner after the press conference i called in to my office to say that herb was very entertaining as usual but made no news my editor said that dallas mayor steve bartlett that day had backed off his idea of amending the wright amendment and that i should ask crandall for comment this would be easy because crandall would be pleased that bartlett was withdrawing his proposali found crandall at the reception and got his attention before i could ask my question he tore into me about two stories that had appeared in the previous sunday’s newspaperback then we had a column called sunday notebook in which we dropped items of interest  that didnt justify a separate storyone item i wrote the previous sunday pointed out that delta in  had lost all the dfw airport market share that it had picked up at american’s expense in a second item said that american was sending employees a  gift check for finishing first in an airline quality index at the bottom of the item i had noted that some aa pilots were donating their checks to a strike fund for american’s regional pilots in puerto ricocrandall said i seemed to regret delta’s loss of market share no explanation is necessary about what he didn’t like the second item he turned his back to me to get another drink when he turned around he tore into me again then he abruptly turned to someone else at the reception and began a pleasant conversationi spent the next day observing cockpit resource management training at southwest when i got back to office late that afternoon my editor said something along the lines of “we got problems”american’s corporate communications office had called during the day to say that crandall had barred aa employees from talking to me ever again well how about thatas it so happened that very evening i got a tip from someone involved in the confirm rs project – the one referenced earlier that eventually brought american more than  million in losses – that the project appeared to be collapsing that people were moving out of their offices with their belongings in boxesso that’s the first story i had to work after getting the aa banafter delicate diplomatic negotiations i faxed my questions to the public relations people at american and they faxed aas answers back to the business editor i wrote the story from their faxed responsethis continued for about two weeks then we had another one of those foodchain dinners and it was as if the whole brouhaha had not happenedothers inside aa later told me that crandall thought his edict would force the dallas morning news to take me off the airline beat instead it seems to have made me airline reporter for lifei’ve since wondered if crandall had gotten a briefing from sabre chief max hopper about the enormous mess at confirm and then went straight from that bad news to the kelleher event – and up i walked i asked him about that sequence of events many years later he said he didn’t remember that it was probably just us being macho believe me i wasn’tam not machocrandall had a reputation of being merciless with a subordinate who was not prepared or tried to bluff his or her way through a presentation he expected others to work as hard as him and to care about his airline and about winning as much as he didhe also had a reputation for being fiercely loyal to those who met his standards and compassionate when compassion was called forhe also had a sense of humorin the early s i sat in on a “president’s conference” at a university of texasarlington theater each year crandall would lead a series of meetings with employees in which he and his team would give a stateoftheairlineindustry presentation and then answer questionsat this particular conference he told a story about a man who slipped off a cliff and barely grabbed onto a bush on the side of the cliff to keep him from falling to his death “help help” the man yelled “is there anyone up there” suddenly a light shone out of the clouds and a voice boomed “it is the lord thy god release the bush and i will lift you up”the man looked down far below to the ground then looked back up “is there anyone else up there’ he yelledgood joke but the point was that there was nobody else up there that american could not rely on others to save itlater during the qa an employee noted that union employees had won a third week of vacation after  years’ service and he wanted nonunion employees to get the same in a lengthy answer crandall acknowledged the desire for more vacation but said no those employees would still get only two weeks’ vacationthe employee thought about it and then said “is there anyone else up there”crandall laughed as heartily as everyone elsein march  crandall spoke to the wings club an aviationfocused group that attracts the big names in airlines and aircraft he was asked his biggest mistakes and his biggest triumphs“in terms of worst decision probably we weren’t smart enough to realize that nashville and raleigh durham weren’t going to work we got smarter as time passed” crandall said“the best decision i think was when in the early s we persuaded the union that allowing us to grow a new airline within the american airlines framework on a twotier basis it allowed us to triple the size of the airline it allowed us to create a very successful commercial enterprise and it allowed us to provide jobs to  people that didn’t have one when we started so i think that was pretty good”crandall stepped down as chairman and ceo of american and amr in may  and he and wife jan flew to england to pick up a boat arway they had commissioned they then sailed it back to the united statesi saw him that september at a dallas event where he was speaking and told him some pilots had already said they wished crandall was still running the airline crandall who butted heads frequently with the unions just laughedwhen he stepped down from american he stepped down completely he didn’t stay on the amr board and has largely refrained from commenting publicly about american’s path in the years he may have been calling up aa executives every day to tell them what they should do but if he did it never became publici’ve seen him a few times since and we have a cordial relationship most recently i visited with him and jan on dec   the day that american and us airways merged to form american airlines group i told him that it seemed he was sending a message to the troops by showing up at aa hqs to applaud the merger“that was the idea the idea they had and the idea i had by agreeing to come was that i think these guys are saying the right things” crandall said “now if they do what they say they’ll do then i think this will work very well”at ceremonies marking the merger crandall expressed regret that he wouldn’t be able to help out in the merger i asked him later about whether he really would have liked to go through all that work againyes indeed said crandall who had turned  only two days before“it would be great fun to do it again i had a wonderful time doing it it would be great fun to do it again but i said to jan this morning even if they asked me to come back and run it i’m not physically able any more to work hour days and that’s what it takes you’ve got to get up at  in the morning and you’ve got to be able to stay up until  o’clock at night and i can’t do that anymore” view comments sponsored stories get the most important dfw news in your inbox sign up for our

celestica inc and former ceo and chair of amr corp and american airlines shares some strong thoughts on ceos and boards working closer together march   robert crandall is best known globally for being the ceo and chair of amr corp and american airlines inc through much of the s and ’s he played a central role in making american the leading innovator in the industry and directed its rise from domestic carrier to major international airline but crandall has also had a lengthy canadian presence sitting on the board of celestica since  becoming chair in  here in an exclusive interview with listed contributing editor and governance expert david w anderson crandall outlines three primary criticisms of corporate governance today in particular he draws on his personal experience to challenge the conventional “nonsense” that says company operations are none of a director’s business he says it’s up to ceos to do more to educate their boards the more directors know crandall says the more a ceo benefits from their advice david w anderson you are counted among the legendary leaders in us business history you ran amramerican airlines for  years overseeing its remarkable expansion and success in the s and ’s since then you’ve served as a director of several public and private companies including as chair of celestica in canada how has your experience as a ceo made you a better director robert l crandall being a successful ceo shapes your view of how other ceos ought to manage the experience of running a company has provided me a template against which to measure the performance of management that’s vital because the board is there to judge management’s performance performance is the bottom line and it must be judged in both absolute and comparative terms there are many managements who succeed in absolute terms but which fall short when measured against the accomplishments of their competitors david w anderson what specifically do you look for in a ceo’s performance to make your judgment robert l crandall my expectation is that the ceo will apply high standards to the work he or she expects from subordinates and the company as a whole and will expect the board to apply similarly high standards to the ceo’s performance in particular i expect the ceo to have a comprehensive knowledge of the company’s affairs and to answer most questions directors pose without needing to do much followup research and without needing to call often on subordinates if the ceo doesn’t know the answers i get concerned because it means he or she is not asking the same questions and isn’t deep enough into daytoday operations of course it’s important for the ceo to expose the board to his or her subordinates and i see the competence of those subordinates as a reflection on the ceo providing another means of assessment david w anderson are there personal characteristics of a ceo that provide you with insight into performance or by which you gauge a ceo’s credibility robert l crandall i want to see confidence crisp and wellreasoned decisionmaking and an ability to choose leaders i expect the ceo to be personally involved in all substantive corporate decisions if the ceo relies too much on subordinates i think it shows a lack of confidence and often reflects an inappropriate degree of delegation the board is paying the ceo to run the place david w anderson if you think ceos are at risk of overdelegating do you think the same of boards do boards give ceos too much leeway robert l crandall yes i think ceos tend to overdelegate and as a generality expect too much delegation from their boards but boards let them get away with it as a result boards are at the mercy of their ceos who often share lots less information than they should david w anderson you’ve been a consistently fierce critic of boards from a vantage point few others have yet much has changed since enron made governance frontpage news how do you critique the state of corporate governance today robert l crandall i’ll agree that boards are doing better than a decade ago but it’s a low bar sure there have been improvements in how boards function but there is more window dressing than substance i have three main criticisms which if addressed might begin to bring real change first boards aren’t really holding management sufficiently accountable secondly boards often aren’t sufficiently knowledgeable of the business to play a fully engaged role and thirdly boards are not functioning well from a compensation perspective david w anderson let’s examine those points in turn where’s the flaw in management accountability to boards robert l crandall the greatest failure of boards is that they don’t focus sufficiently on performance metrics how many boards really know about the quality of their products and the satisfaction of customers relative to competitors boards don’t explore these questions in sufficient detail too often a singular focus on financial metrics lulls directors into complacency and keeps them away from the operational metrics where early warning flags may exist the habit of using financial reports as the only measure of success has led to spectacular failures directors need to ask questions about how the company is operating in a more demanding way than they do now this means broadening their interest beyond financial metrics to lots more operational metrics i mean for example that it should have been fully obvious to gm’s board for many years prior to the company’s bankruptcy that gm was doing all the wrong things—building the wrong cars paying above market wages and benefits and falling further and further behind others on quality measures david w anderson are there any particular performance metrics boards should look for to better understand the core of the business—the operations robert l crandall boards need to insist on performance metrics that are relevant to the nature of the business and on comparing those performance metrics to those of competitors until boards raise detailed performance related questions they can’t truly measure management’s performance and that means i think that boards need lots more information than managements typically provide boards have the ability to cause management to gather and present this information to the board but seem inclined to use it only when there is some sort of crisis boards have to move beyond that mindset and insist on indepth detailed operating information on a continuing basis david w anderson would developing an independent research capability address your second criticism of how boards currently govern—namely that boards lack sufficient knowledge of the business to be fully effective robert l crandall an independent board research capability probably isn’t the answer let’s understand the issue here a board needs to have an indepth understanding of the business—from competitive pressures to technological challenges—to participate fully in a dialogue with management on strategic planning and performance metrics if the board doesn’t know enough it simply can’t understand the implications of the data and form its own judgment the only way a board will have sufficient knowledge of the business is if the ceo fully understands the issues—many do not—and takes the time to educate the board about what those issues are and how the company is dealing with them the board can encourage this but the ceo has to make it happen if management wants a meaningful dialogue with the board the ceo will take time to teach the board the business in a sense running an airline was a great advantage as our board members rode around on the planes the employees told directors exactly what they thought about management and about how the airline was doing relative to its competitors that openness encouraged directors to be more educated and management to be more transparent—because we couldn’t hide the real issues david w anderson are you encouraging directors to take the initiative to talk to employees directly robert l crandall yes the mindset holding back most boards is the notion that running the business is separate from governing the management process and that operations are none of the directors’ business what could be more their business than how the company is run this illustrates the constant tension directors face needing to know what’s going on in order to do their job but being told not to intrude on management’s turf by asking irritating questions boards lose both ways by being criticized for being too involved or after the fact for not knowing enough david w anderson to many directors and ceos what you’re advocating will sound like a violation of the cardinal rule of governance that boards are told to follow “nose in fingers out” robert l crandall unhappily that nonsense is widely accepted as a truism the problem is that boards don’t see themselves as performance critics and too often feel they are supposed to be cheerleaders for management directors who ask pointed questions are often accused of “micromanaging” when they are actually seeking to take responsibility for understanding the events they are asked to evaluate i’m amused at how often after things go wrong the board and the ceo replace people further down in the organization that’s not taking responsibility for being the boss david w anderson looking at this from the ceo perspective how would you advise a ceo to work with a board seeking greater engagement—or simply to get the most value from directors robert l crandall my advice is simple educate your board comprehensively so that the board knows everything you know the best way to take advantage of a board’s experience is to give the board exposure to management’s analysis and the competing opinions before major decisions are made in large companies in particular the analytical work done to support decisions tends to be extensive and professional being immersed in these data allows the board to bring its expertise to bear what often happens though is the board gets presented with just a summary of the analysis and management’s conclusion so there’s little opportunity to add value rather than keeping the data and applying your own judgment in isolation of the board benefit from its experience by allowing the board’s judgment to be brought to bear on the same data this is a rare experience for any board the ceo may find his or her conclusions differ from those of the board but a confident ceo wouldn’t be concerned and a competent ceo won’t find that happens very often a confident and competent ceo ought to take full advantage of a board by educating it extensively if the board doesn’t comprehend key issues in the business its view on strategy won’t be relevant whatever their experience david w anderson the third major criticism of governance you identified was excessive executive pay you’re a rarity among business leaders in your condemnation of current pay practices—and rarer still for advocating much higher marginal tax rates on highincome earners why do you feel so passionately about pay robert l crandall a lot of ceo compensation granted by boards is clearly excessive go back  years and you’ll find a typical ceo made  times average compensation at the company not  times as we see today are ceos that much better now is the market for ceos that much tighter no simply boards are not doing a good job of controlling the rate of pay for executives and are far too timid about acknowledging that losing a ceo who wants to be paid more probably isn’t the end of the world david w anderson beyond this inefficient use of shareholder money has the considerable change in executive pay you’ve noted had other implications that concern you robert l crandall two other consequences of excessive executive pay bother me the first is the increasing level of societal income inequality today we seem to be living in a world that is shaped by the idea the people at the top are entitled to an outsized share of the rewards the people who actually make the company work are as a consequence getting a smaller share of the pie this is not right by any standard of fairness or morality when you take away fairness you undermine the work ethic and the belief in potential upward mobility that makes a society work here’s the reality my phone com pany is a good company not because of the ceo but because of the guy who comes to fix the line at my home it’s the same in the airline business the frontline worker is key but you wouldn’t know it today secondly at the management level excessive ceo pay can have a debilitating impact by understating the value of the corporate team yes the ceo makes a real difference by setting the tone needs to be an effective leader and is hopefully the most competent and creative member of the senior team but there are lots of competent people in management paying the ceo multiples of what his or her subordinates earn has an adverse affect on people’s ability to function as a team when you come to ceo succession everyone knows that whoever prevails in the contest to lead will receive several times the compensation earned by others this makes the competition to become the leader more intense than is healthy and makes it hard to keep other valued executives overall these disparities and inequalities undermine both effective management and effective governance david w anderson
