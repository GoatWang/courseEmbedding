of the adviser and its affiliates to requests in recent years from regulatory authorities such as the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority        msar completion portfolio   board of trustees contract approval  continued     the board considered shareholder and other administrative services provided or managed by eaton vance management and its affiliates including transfer agency and accounting services the board evaluated the benefits to shareholders of investing in a fund that is a part of a large family of funds including the ability in many cases to exchange an investment among different funds without incurring additional sales charges after consideration of the foregoing factors among others the board concluded that the nature extent and quality of services provided by the adviser and subadviser taken as a whole are appropriate and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory agreement and the subadvisory agreement portfolio performance the board compared the portfolios investment performance to a relevant universe of similarly managed funds identified by an independent data provider and appropriate benchmark indices the board reviewed comparative performance data for the oneyear period ended september   for the portfolio in light of the portfolios relatively brief operating history the board concluded that additional time is required to evaluate portfolio performance management fees and expenses the board reviewed contractual investment advisory fee rates payable by the portfolio referred to as management fees as part of its review the board considered the management fees and the portfolios total expense ratio for the year ended september   as compared to a group of similarly managed funds selected by an independent data provider the board noted that the portfolio has established a whollyowned subsidiary to accommodate the portfolios commodityrelated investments the subsidiary is managed by the adviser pursuant to a separate investment advisory agreement that is subject to annual approval by the board the subsidiarys fee rates are the same as those charged to the portfolio and the portfolio will not pay any additional management fees with respect to its assets invested in the subsidiary the board also considered factors that had an impact on portfolio expense ratios as identified by management in response to inquiries from the contract review committee as well as actions taken by management in recent years to reduce expenses at the eaton vance fund complex level including the negotiation of reduced fees for transfer agency and custody services after reviewing the foregoing information and in light of the nature extent and quality of the services provided by the adviser and the subadviser the board concluded that the management fees charged for advisory and related services are reasonable profitability the board reviewed the level of profits realized by the adviser and relevant affiliates thereof in providing investment advisory and administrative services to the portfolio and to all eaton vance funds as a group the board considered the level of profits realized without regard to revenue sharing or other payments by the adviser and its affiliates to third parties in respect of distribution services the board also considered other direct or indirect benefits received by the adviser and its affiliates including the subadviser in connection with their relationships with the portfolio including the benefits of research services that may be available to the adviser or the subadviser as a result of securities transactions effected for the portfolio and other investment advisory clients the board concluded that in light of the foregoing factors and the nature extent and quality of the services rendered the profits realized by the adviser and its affiliates including the subadviser are reasonable economies of scale in reviewing management fees and profitability the board also considered the extent to which the adviser and its affiliates on the one hand and the portfolio on the other hand can expect to realize benefits from economies of scale as the assets of the portfolio increase the board acknowledged the difficulty in accurately measuring the benefits resulting from the economies of scale with respect to the management of any specific fund or group of funds the board reviewed data summarizing the increases and decreases in the assets of the portfolio and of all eaton vance funds as a group over various time periods and evaluated the extent to which the total expense ratio of the portfolio and the profitability of the adviser and its affiliates may have been affected by such increases or decreases based upon the foregoing the board concluded that the portfolio currently shares in the benefits from economies of scale the board also concluded that assuming reasonably foreseeable increases in the assets of the portfolio the structure of the advisory fee which includes breakpoints at several asset levels will allow the portfolio to continue to benefit from economies of scale in the future

investments debt obligations debt obligations including shortterm obligations with a remaining maturity of more than sixty days are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by third party pricing services as derived from such services pricing models inputs to the models may include but are not limited to reported trades executable bid and asked prices brokerdealer quotations prices or yields of securities with similar characteristics interest rates anticipated prepayments benchmark curves or information pertaining to the issuer as well as industry and economic events the pricing services may use a matrix approach which considers information regarding securities with similar characteristics to determine the valuation for a security shortterm obligations purchased with a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are generally valued at amortized cost which approximates market value derivatives exchangetraded options other than flexible exchange traded options are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices at valuation time as reported by the options price reporting authority for us listed options or by the relevant exchange or board of trade for nonus listed options overthecounter options including options on securities indices and foreign currencies and flexible exchange traded options traded at the chicago board options exchange are valued by a

expiration financial futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price established by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded swaps are normally valued using valuations

investment securities in the same manner as debt obligations described above fair valuation investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the direction of the trustees of the portfolio in a manner that fairly reflects the securitys value or the amount that the portfolio might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its current sale in the ordinary course each such determination is based on a consideration of relevant factors which are likely to vary from one pricing context to another these factors may include but are not limited to the type of security the existence of any contractual restrictions on the securitys disposition the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of comparable companies or entities quotations or relevant information obtained from brokerdealers or other market participants

enhance total returns and to gain exposure to the investment returns of commodities markets without investing directly in physical commodities equity price risk the portfolio seeks to generate incremental return by writing a series of call and put option spread transactions on an index of common stocks if the index appreciates or depreciates sufficiently over the period to offset the net premium received the portfolio will incur a net loss the amount of potential loss in the event of a sharp market movement is subject to a cap defined by the difference in strike prices between written

contracts to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rate risk the portfolio holds fixedrate bonds the value of these bonds may decrease if interest rates rise to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and to manage its effective duration the portfolio enters into us treasury futures contracts the portfolio enters into swap contracts that may contain provisions whereby the counterparty may terminate the contract under certain conditions including but not limited to a decline in the portfolios net assets below a certain level over a certain period of time which

 the aggregate fair value of assets pledged as collateral by the portfolio for such liability was  at october   the overthecounter otc derivatives in which the portfolio invests are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the contract fails to perform its obligations under the contract to mitigate this risk the portfolio and subsidiary has entered into an international swaps and derivatives association inc master agreement isda master agreement or similar agreement with substantially all its derivative counterparties an isda master agreement is a bilateral agreement between the portfolio and a counterparty that governs certain otc derivatives and typically contains among other things setoff provisions in the event of a default andor termination event as defined under the relevant isda master agreement under an isda master agreement the portfolio and subsidiary may under certain circumstances offset with the counterparty certain derivative financial instruments payables andor receivables with collateral held andor posted and create one single net payment the provisions of the isda master agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event of default including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty however bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy or insolvency certain isda master agreements allow counterparties to otc derivatives to terminate derivative contracts prior to maturity in the event the portfolios net assets decline by a stated percentage or the portfolio fails to meet the terms of its isda master agreements which would cause the counterparty to accelerate payment by the portfolio of any net liability owed to it the collateral requirements for derivatives traded under an isda master agreement are governed by a credit support annex to the isda master agreement collateral requirements are determined at the close of business each day and are typically based on changes in market values for each transaction under an isda master agreement and netted into one amount for such agreement generally the amount of collateral due from or to a counterparty is subject to a minimum transfer threshold amount before a transfer is required which may vary by counterparty collateral pledged for the benefit of the portfolio and subsidiary andor counterparty is held in segregated accounts by the portfolios custodian and cannot be sold repledged assigned or otherwise used while pledged the portion of such collateral representing cash if any is reflected as restricted cash and in the case of cash pledged by a counterparty for the benefit of the portfolio a corresponding liability on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities securities pledged by the portfolio as collateral if any are identified as such in the consolidated portfolio of investments because the subsidiary is not registered under the  act it may not be able to negotiate terms with its counterparties that are equivalent to those a registered portfolio may negotiate as a result the subsidiary may have greater
