fund for your portfolio  diversified real asset income fund nysedra  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»dra a diversified real asset fund for your portfolioaug  about diversified real dra maks f s registered investment advisor portfolio strategy reits mutual fundsmaks financial servicessummarydra is a closedend fund sponsored by nuveen investments seeking a high level of current income and longterm capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of real assetsthe nuveen diversified real asset income fund currently yields a  distribution and is trading at a discount of  to its net asset valuethe fund has outperformed its category since inceptionover the last few days we have been focusing on infrastructure and utility related investments this all started when i decided that it was time to cash in the profits on one of our best performers year to date the blackrock utility and infrastructure fund nysebui yesterday i discussed our search for replacements for the infrastructure and utility allocation in the article  utility closed end funds you can still buy at a discount one of those funds and one that immediately shot to the top of our due diligence list was nuveens diversified real asset income fund nysedra while i have not personally invested in dra directly i do have experience with the open end mutual fund version the nuveen real asset income fund mutfnriax mutfnricx mutfnriix mutfnrifx which is a  star morningstar rated fund fund basics sponsor nuveen investments managers john wenker jay rosenberg jeffrey schmitz brenda langenfeld tryg sarsland aum  million in investment exposure  million net assets historical style global debt  equity investment objectives the funds investment objective is a high level of current income and longterm capital appreciation number of holdings  current yield  based on market price monthly distributions inception date  fees    interest expense  total note there is currently an expense reimbursement of  which brings the total expense down to  no guarantees on future expense reimbursements discount to nav  sources cef connect nuveen and ycharts the alpha with any type of actively managed investment it ultimately comes down to is there value created in excess of the fees generated and the risk taken when it comes to the special sauce for both dra and the open end fund versions nuveen will point to their extensive management experience in these asset classes and their top down process nuveen asset managements real assets team draws upon extensive industry experience in real asset public policy urban planning and real estate finance and valuation and manages over  billion in real estate and infrastructure investments sources dra  jri fact sheet sources dra  jri fact sheet dra in particular may also invest in whole loans and there is no limit on the allocation to debt securities furthermore while the fund is going to have us investments it may invest up to  in nonus securities this results in the following asset allocation for the fund source nuveen breaking this down by sector we get about  allocated to reits  to utilities and the rest to other infrastructure investments finally the fund is able to employ one of my favorite strategies covered call writing to generate incremental income so how has it done the numbers simply put the fund has done fairly well in providing on its promises year to date the fund is up  since inception the fund has made up its ipo load and returned a solid  the difficult part comes in where it comes to benchmarking the fund of this type because since it is diversified while the fund is categorized as a global real estate fund by cef connect dra holds a sizable utility allocation a lot of which is fixed income so lets take a look at the fund versus a few different indexed etfs and its open end version we take a look at dra compared to the spdr dj global real estate etf nysearcarwo the spdr utility etf nysearcaxlu the sp  spdr nysearcaspy and the nuveen real asset income fund year to date dra is only bested by xlu trailed by its open end version and nearly doubling the returns of the global real estate etf and the sp  on a  year time frame the picture remains similar finally over the last  years or so dra does trail xlu and a lot of it can be attributed back and attributed to the general sell off in the market price of dra in the beginning of the year our take and bottom line has the fund done well absolutely is it fair to compare the fund directly to equity investments probably not especially since a good chunk of the fund is fixed income where we use the open end version of this fund is in our alternative investments allocation and for income investors we allocate nriax to the alpha bucket since we have decided to eliminate bui and have gone through this process we now see two uses for dra first because it is trading at a sizable discount to its net asset value we will likely be replacing the nriax allocation with dra in the majority of the cases where it is prudent for the clients secondly dra will be one out of the few funds that will take place of bui for the time being does it work for you does it belong for the long term allocation nuveen has fairly good arguments first real assets have outpaced inflation source dra fact sheet secondly this asset class has a historically low correlation to bonds both reits and infrastructure investments have a  correlation to bonds as per morningstar from april   march   why this fund and this structure nuveen invests across the capital structure which will seek to provide a high level of income and be flexible enough to invest in the best place in the capital stack finally because it is a closed end fund the main advantages here particularly versus the open end fund version is that dra is able to employ leverage which increases the distributable income and may enhance total return secondly because there is no need to raise cash to meet redemption requests the portfolio remains fully invested and does not have to sell investments at inopportune times this character is also what causes the divergence between the market

overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high high this funds expenses are rated as high because they are above the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in investments related to real assets and real asset companies it seeks to achieve its investment objective by allocating its assets among general investment categories related to real assets and real asset companies which include tangible assets and investments that are expected to perform well in periods of high inflation risk in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political

for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchange traded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and   year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems

accountthe following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments for more complete risk information see the prospectus the funds investment in income securities is subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the fund will have a significant portion of its assets concentrated in commoditylinked securities developments affecting commodities will have a disproportionate impact on the fund the funds investment in commoditylinked derivative instruments may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss including the likelihood of greater volatility of the funds net asset value and there can be no assurance that the funds use of leverage will be successful the fund may invest in futures contracts and derivatives many derivatives create leverage that can cause the fund to be more volatile than it would be if it had not used derivatives the fund invests in other jp morgan funds and etfs as a primary strategy so the funds investment performance and risks are directly related to the performance and risks of the underlying funds shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the funds expenses but also similar expenses of the investment company an etf may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss that may be disproportionately higher than the amount invested the fund may invest in etns the value of which may be influenced by time to maturity level of supply and demand for the etn volatility and lack of liquidity in underlying commodities markets changes in the
