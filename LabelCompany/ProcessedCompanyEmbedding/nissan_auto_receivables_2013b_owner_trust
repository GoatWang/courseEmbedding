statistical rating organizations hired by the sponsor to assign ratings on the notes the hired rating agencies  the ratings of the notes will address the likelihood of payment of principal and interest on the notes according to their terms although the hired rating agencies are not contractually obligated to do so we believe that each hired rating agency rating the notes will monitor the ratings using its normal surveillance procedures any hired rating agency may change or withdraw an assigned rating at any time in addition a rating agency not hired by the sponsor to rate the transaction may provide an unsolicited rating that differs from or is lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies any rating action taken by one rating agency may not necessarily be taken by the other rating agency no transaction party will be responsible for monitoring any changes to the ratings on the notes see risk factors a reduction withdrawal or qualification of the ratings

risk factors you should consider the following risk factors and the factors set forth under risk factors in the accompanying prospectus in deciding whether to purchase the notes of any class payment priorities increase risk of loss or delay in payment to certain notes based on the priorities described under the notes payments of interest and the notes payments of principal in this prospectus supplement classes of notes that receive payments particularly principal payments before other classes will be repaid more rapidly than the other classes in addition because principal of each class of notes will be paid sequentially so long as no event of default has occurred classes of notes that have higher ie  being higher than  sequential numerical class designations will be outstanding longer and therefore will be exposed to the risk of losses on the receivables during periods after other classes have been receiving most or all amounts payable on their notes and after which a disproportionate amount of credit enhancement may have been applied and not replenished because of the priority of payment on the notes the yields of the class a notes the class a notes and the class

a notes if the actual rate and amount of losses exceed your expectations and if amounts in the reserve account are insufficient to cover the resulting shortfalls the yield to maturity on your notes may be lower than anticipated and you could suffer a loss classes of notes that receive payments earlier than expected are exposed to greater reinvestment risk and classes of notes that receive

not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the motor vehicle loans information regarding credit scores for the motor vehicle loans obtained at the time of origination of the related receivables is presented in the receivables characteristics of the receivables general in this prospectus supplement a credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a borrower represents to a lender ie that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score neither the depositor the sponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any obligor s current credit score or the actual performance of any receivable or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a receivable will be paid in accordance with its terms s the continuing economic downturn may adversely affect the performance of the motor vehicle loans which could result in losses on the notes the united states is experiencing a continuing period of economic slowdown that may adversely affect the performance and market value of your notes high unemployment and the continued reduced availability of credit may lead to increased default rates this period may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding automobile loan contracts which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales in addition higher future energy and fuel prices could reduce the amount of disposable income that consumers have available to make monthly payments on their automobile loan contracts higher energy costs could cause business disruptions which could cause unemployment and a further or deepening economic downturn such obligors could potentially become delinquent in making monthly payments or default if they are unable to make payments due to increased energy or fuel bills or unemployment the issuing entity s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if the related obligors are unable to make timely payments while certain economic factors have improved recently other factors such as unemployment have not yet returned to levels existing prior to the economic slowdown if the economic downturn worsens or continues for a prolonged period of time delinquencies and losses with respect to automobile loans generally could increase again in addition extreme weather conditions or natural or manmade disasters and their immediate consequences could cause substantial business disruptions economic losses unemployment and an economic downturn when any of these events occur the obligor s ability or willingness to make payments on the receivables the value of used vehicles or the servicer s ability to administer the receivables could be adversely affected and accordingly the issuing entity s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected see prepayments delinquencies repossessions and net credit losses delinquency repossession and credit loss information and static pool information in this prospectus supplement for delinquency and loss information regarding certain automobile loans originated and serviced by nissan motor acceptance corporation s geographic concentration of the states of origination of the receivables may increase the risk of loss on your investment as of the statistical cutoff date nissan motor acceptance corporation s records indicate that the billing addresses of the obligors of the receivables were most highly concentrated in the following states percentage of aggregate statistical cutoff date principal balance texas  california  florida  no other state based on the billing addresses of the obligors accounted for more than  of the total principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cutoff date economic conditions or other factors affecting these states in particular could adversely affect the delinquency credit loss repossession or prepayment experience of the issuing entity this prospectus supplement provides information regarding the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cutoff date that may differ from the characteristics of the receivables as of the cutoff date sold to the issuing entity on the closing date this prospectus supplement describes the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cutoff date the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date may have characteristics that differ somewhat from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool described in this prospectus supplement we do not expect the characteristics as of the cutoff date of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date to differ materially from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cutoff date described in this prospectus supplement and each receivable sold to the issuing entity on the closing date must satisfy the eligibility criteria specified in the transaction documents if you purchase a note you must not assume that the characteristics of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date will be identical to the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool disclosed in this prospectus supplement s prepaid simple interest contracts may affect the weighted average life of the notes if an obligor on a simple interest contract makes a payment on the contract ahead of schedule the weighted average life of the notes could be affected this is because the additional payment will be treated as a principal prepayment and applied to reduce the principal balance of the related contract and the obligor will generally not be required to make any scheduled payments during the period for which it has paid ahead during this prepaid period interest will continue to accrue on the principal balance of the contract as reduced by the application of the additional payment but the obligor s contract would not be considered delinquent while the servicer may be required to make interest advances during this period no principal advances will be made furthermore when the obligor resumes his required payments the payments so paid may be insufficient to cover the interest that has accrued since the last payment by the obligor this situation will continue until the regularly scheduled payments are once again sufficient to cover all accrued interest and to reduce the principal balance of the contract the payment by the issuing entity of the prepaid principal amount of the notes will generally shorten the weighted average life of the notes however depending on the length of time during which a prepaid simple interest contract is not amortizing as described above the weighted average life of the notes may be extended in addition to the extent the servicer makes advances on a prepaid simple interest contract that subsequently goes into default the loss on this contract may be larger than would have been the case had advances not been made because liquidation proceeds for the contract will be applied first to reimburse the servicer for its advances nissan motor acceptance corporation s portfolio of retail installment contracts has historically included simple interest contracts that have been paid ahead by one or more scheduled monthly payments there can be no assurance as to the number of contracts in the issuing entity that may become prepaid simple interest contracts as described above or the number or the principal amount of the scheduled payments that may be paid ahead s risk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure you may suffer losses due to receivables with low annual percentage rates a reduction withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes because the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the principal balance of the receivables the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potential replacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the receivables has been repaid due to the reduction in the servicing fee as described in the foregoing it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer consequently the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under those circumstances may result in delays andor reductions in the interest and principal payments on your notes the receivables may include receivables that have annual percentage rates that are less than the interest rates on the notes if that is the case interest paid on the higher coupon receivables and collections related to the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will compensate for the lower coupon receivables excessive prepayments on the higher coupon receivables may adversely impact your notes by reducing the amount of interest available in the future to make payments on your notes the ratings on the notes are not recommendations to purchase hold or sell the notes and do not address market value or investor suitability the ratings reflect the rating agency s assessment of the creditworthiness of the receivables the credit enhancement on the notes and the likelihood of repayment of the notes there can be no assurance that the receivables andor the notes will perform as expected or that the ratings will not be reduced withdrawn or qualified in the future as a result of a change of circumstances deterioration in the performance of the receivables errors in analysis or otherwise none of the depositor the sponsor or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit enhancement or to take any other action to maintain any ratings on the notes if the ratings on your notes are reduced withdrawn or qualified it could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes the sponsor has hired two rating agencies and will pay them a fee to assign ratings on the notes the sponsor has not hired any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization or nrsro to assign ratings on the notes and is not aware that any other nrsro has assigned ratings on the notes however under sec rules information provided to a hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes is required to be made available to each nrsro in order to make it possible for such nonhired nrsros to assign unsolicited ratings on the notes an unsolicited rating could be assigned at any time including prior to the closing date and none of the depositor the sponsor the underwriters or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to inform you of any unsolicited ratings assigned after the date of this prospectus supplement nrsros including the hired rating agencies have different methodologies criteria models and requirements if any nonhired nrsro assigns an unsolicited rating on the notes there can be no assurance that such rating will not be lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies which could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your s notes in addition if the sponsor fails to make available to the nonhired nrsros any information provided to any hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes a hired rating agency could withdraw its ratings on the notes which could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes potential investors in the notes are urged to make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of the receivables and the credit enhancement on the notes and not to rely solely on the ratings on the notes potential rating agency conflict of interest and regulatory scrutiny federal financial regulatory reform could have a significant impact on the servicer the sponsor the depositor or the issuing entity and could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments on your notes the sponsor has hired two nrsros to provide their ratings on the notes we note that a rating agency may have a conflict of interest where as is the case with the ratings of the notes by the hired rating agencies the sponsor or the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the rating agency for its rating services furthermore rating agencies including the hired rating agencies have been and may continue to be under scrutiny by federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies for their roles in the recent financial crisis and such scrutiny and any actions such legislative and regulatory bodies may take as a result thereof may also have an adverse effect on the market value of the notes and your ability to resell your notes on july   president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act  although the doddfrank act generally took effect on july   many provisions did not take effect for some time some provisions are still not effective and many provisions require implementing regulations to be issued the doddfrank act is extensive and significant legislation that among other things creates a framework for the liquidation of certain bank holding companies and other nonbank financial companies defined as covered financial companies in the event such a company is in default or in danger of default and the resolution of such a company under other applicable law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states and also for the liquidation of certain of their respective subsidiaries defined as covered subsidiaries in the event such a subsidiary is in default or in danger of default and the liquidation of such subsidiary would avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on financial stability or economic conditions of the united states creates a new framework for the regulation of overthecounter derivatives activities strengthens the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the sec and creates the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb  a new agency responsible for administering and enforcing the laws and regulations for consumer financial products and services the doddfrank act impacts the offering marketing and regulation of consumer financial products and services offered by financial institutions the cfpb has supervision examination and enforcement authority over the consumer financial products and services of certain nondepository institutions and large insured depository institutions and their respective affiliates the doddfrank act also increases the regulation of the securitization markets for example implementing regulations will require securitizers or originators to retain an economic interest in a portion s of the credit risk for any asset that they securitize or originate it gives broader powers to the sec to regulate credit rating agencies and adopt regulations governing these organizations and their activities compliance with the implementing regulations under the doddfrank act or the oversight of the sec or other government entities as applicable may impose costs on create operational constraints for or place limits on pricing with respect to finance companies such as nissan motor acceptance corporation many provisions of the doddfrank act are required to be implemented through rulemaking by the appropriate federal regulatory agencies over the next couple of years as such in many respects the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act and its effects on the financial markets and their participants will not be fully known for an extended period of time in particular no assurance can be given that these new requirements imposed or to be imposed after implementing regulations are issued by the doddfrank act will not have a significant impact on the servicing of the receivables and on the regulation and supervision of the servicer the subservicer the sponsor the originator the depositor the issuing entity andor their respective affiliates in addition no assurance can be given that the liquidation framework for the resolution of covered financial companies or the covered subsidiaries would not apply to nissan motor acceptance corporation or its affiliates the issuing entity or the depositor or if it were to apply would not result in a repudiation of any of the transaction documents where further performance is required or an automatic stay or similar power preventing the indenture trustee or other transaction parties from exercising their rights this repudiation power could also affect certain transfers of the receivables as further described under material legal aspects of the receivables dodd frank orderly liquidation framework in the accompanying prospectus application of this framework could materially adversely affect the timing and amount of payments of principal and interest on your notes see material legal aspects of the receivables dodd frank orderly liquidation framework in the accompanying prospectus lack of liquidity in the secondary market may adversely affect your notes there will be no market for the notes prior to their issuance and there can be no assurance that a secondary market will develop after such issuance recent and continuing events in the global financial markets including the failure acquisition or government seizure of several major financial institutions the establishment of government programs to assist financial institutions problems related to subprime mortgages and other financial assets the devaluation of various assets in secondary markets the forced sale of assetbacked and other securities as a result of the deleveraging of structured investment vehicles hedge funds financial institutions and other entities and the lowering of ratings on certain assetbacked securities have caused a significant reduction in liquidity in the secondary market for assetbacked securities illiquidity can have a severely adverse effect on the market value of securities that are especially sensitive to prepayment credit or interest risk such as the notes furthermore the global financial markets have recently experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt of various countries concerns regarding sovereign debt may spread to other countries at any time there can s view more similar documents initial principal amount
