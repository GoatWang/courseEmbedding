miscellaneous expenses including franchise taxes    total      includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination  in addition a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a loan from m iii llc of up to  that we may draw down as described in this prospectus this loan will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses  the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds of this offering if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised  of the gross proceeds from the overallotment will be deposited in the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions upon completion of our initial business combination up to  which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account to pay our taxes based on the current interest rate environment we would expect approximately  per year to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the closing of this offering however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including up to  or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working capital expenses until the earlier of i the completion of our initial business combination or ii the redemption of  of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to the requirements of law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us m iii llc has loaned or agreed to loan us up to  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering this loan is noninterest bearing unsecured and is due at the earlier of july   or the closing of this offering this loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans will be convertible into warrants of the postbusiness combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants no written agreements exist with respect to such loans if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us and cantor fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares private placement shares and except for cantor fitzgerald public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders and cantor fitzgerald have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a delaware blank check corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any business combination target we intend to focus our efforts on seeking and consummating an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between  million and  million although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered while we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector and in any geographic region we expect to focus on businesses based in north america that engage primarily in the financial services healthcare services and industrials sectors because we believe that this best combines the expertise and experience of our combined team with sectors that offer attractive investment opportunities it is our philosophy that capital has become increasingly commoditized and that successful investment results will come not from having capital alone but rather from having the ability to accurately assess businesses with complex strategic management and operational issues and the added expertise to deal with these issues in increasingly competitive and changing environments we believe this to be particularly true during times of economic uncertainty dislocations in capital markets and other conditions that create a challenge for businesses and opportunities for investors with the right management team in recognition of this we have assembled a team of executives directors and other advisors who blend traditional investment and acquisition expertise management and operational expertise and deep experience in financial strategic and operational restructurings we are confident that this team is capable of creating value in businesses that we acquire we believe that the broad experience and expertise of our combined team will enable us to explore a wide range of potential acquisition targets we intend to target companies with strong business fundamentals and those which are in need of operational improvement and can thereby benefit from our human and financial capital the members of our combined team have proven experience and track records in identifying acquiring and improving businesses that have strong underlying fundamentals but are undervalued due to companyspecific issues industry dislocation limited access to capital or other exogenous factors that are fundamentally temporary in nature our combined team has played meaningful roles in contrarian investment situations with businesses requiring significant changes in strategy enhancement of management or operational improvement using our expertise in those areas to improve the businesses and drive ongoing growth we believe that the experience capabilities and track record of our combined team will make us an attractive partner for potential target businesses enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination and thereafter
