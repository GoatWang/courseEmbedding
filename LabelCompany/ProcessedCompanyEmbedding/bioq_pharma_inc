you can actually use ✖ bioquiddity website redesign yields bioq pharma by merrily chopp  october th  bioquiddity is a san franciscobased late stage specialty pharmaceutical company they came to pint inc to work on a redesign that included some major updates including a new name bioq pharma pint helped the bioq  pharma team redesign their site to showcase their unique products unitdose systems for a specialized portfolio of infusible pharmaceuticals while bioq pharma’s product may sound complicated it is actually straightforward they allow doctors to safely deliver medicine to patients their website redesign project was similarly straightforward website redesign details the project began on strong footing when the client came to the project with key redesign wishes inhand they included concepts and specifics such as professionalconservative design geared toward medical professionals clean style with large images large text strong messaging messaging and design focused on presenting the product and the company as trustworthy consistent and solid to businesses and doctors redesign goals with a clear list of wishes pint set to work setting up the goals for the project they would include new navigation pint’s information architect revised the sitemap and navigation of the site to make it easy to use as well as accommodate future growth in content    with the new website bioq decided to update their name as well they officially changed from bioquiddity to bioq pharma that name change meant a new website domain name was also in order when the new website launched pint updated the dns for the old wwwbioquidditycom domain to make it an alias to wwwbioqpharmacom the new primary domain that way anyone who still tried to access wwwbioquidditycom would still find the right site additionally individual pages within the old site need to have their paths redirect with a  permanent redirect to the proper location on the new site for example wwwbioquidditycomabouthtml should redirect to wwwbioqpharmacomcompany this allows for any previously existing inbound links to still direct traffic to the proper content with google webmaster tools pint is working with the bioq pharma team to find any additional links to wwwbioquidditycom on the web that way bioq pharma can try and outreach to the linking site to update the url to an appropriate page on the new site this will help with search engine optimization seo as well as user experience one final touch for returning visitors who may be confused about the new name is a visual “bug” that appears on the homepage this message appears when users visit the homepage to let them know they are in the right place if they were looking for bioquiddity updated style and design pint’s visual designer revamped the look and feel of the site to align with the bioq pharma teams wishes   bioq pharma also came to the project with a willingness to obtain custom photographs of their products custom photos help to bring a professional look to a site in a way that iphone snapshots can only come close to replicating    stock photos when utilized were comprehensively researched to best fit the new doctororiented focus for the site    another new design feature in the redesign project is the pipeline graphic the bioq pharma team wanted to make sure the pipeline was included so they could easily show how many products they are developing and the production stage for each product separated by different regions worldwide  “the product pipeline is a great way for interested visitors to quickly and easily understand when bioq pharma’s products will be available” geordie dudley pint project manager responsive web design rwd pint’s production team coded the site so that it is usable for visitors on a variety of devices using responsive web design helps to eliminate unnecessary scrolling andor zooming for users on laptops tablets and cell phones a redesign to last for years to come this redesign project was planned to meet the bioq pharma team’s needs and wishes however the new navigation updated styling and responsive features ensure this redesign will accommodate the company for years to come even as they add more products content and other features want to built a site to last for your organization we love coming up with ideas email us to get the brainstorming

diabetes patients thrive helping diabetes patients thrive share tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for

the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news
