more than  years after the startup of amarillo mesquite grill in wichita the concept is again back in the hands of its founder  but not in wichita wichitas remaining amarillo grill located at  n rock road closed for business this week a casualty of the chapter  filing by its parent company amarillo mesquite grill inc in may  but the companys other four restaurants that were still operating  located in topeka manhattan and hutchinson kan and enid okla have been repurchased by alan bundy founder of the chain i feel good right now in the fact that were going to have an opportunity to take them back and do something with them bundy says were going through some minor remodeling and redecorating of those locations bundy founded amarillo grill in  growing the concept to four locations two in wichita one in hutchinson and one in kansas city in  bundy sold the chain to wichitabased maverick restaurant corp  which later became amarillo mesquite grill inc  then joined the company as its executive vice president the company grew to  stores but was down to seven when it filed bankruptcy last year some of the stores worked and some didnt and the ones that didnt drug down the ones that did bundy says amarillo mesquite grill inc president chris hotze couldnt be reached for comment returning to wichita all wichita amarillo grill locations  including the north rock road store and stores at  e central and  w central  have closed since the bankruptcy bundy completed his repurchase of the topeka manhattan hutchinson and enid stores last month he says he would have liked to have included the north rock road location but that didnt work at this time there are a lot of different reasons but the main reason is we had enough funds to buy four of the restaurants not five and that one in wichita was the odd man out bundy says that facility is a lot bigger as far as the building and operation is concerned and i kind of made the decision i was going to operate the smaller more manageable facilities the four locations bundy has purchased employ a total of about  people bundy says wichita probably hasnt seen the last of amarillo grill though i believe somewhere down the road there we will be back in wichita with another amarillo mesquite grill he says my deal is to get the four restaurants up and going to their maximum capabilities then ill worry about expanding dennis carpenter president of the kansas restaurant  hospitality association says amarillo grill will be missed in wichita and he hopes they return i do think amarillo grill has a popular menu and popular family prices and that with continued good service and quality of food people will continue to frequent them carpenter says reach sherry graham at  or on the web at sgrahambizjournalscom industries

for defendant memorandum opinion robert e nugent chief judge the chapter  trustee seeks to avoid as preferences under  usc § b debtors payments to defendant iphfha for past due insurance premiums totaling  defendant stipulated at trial that all elements of a preference have been established but asserts the ordinary course of business defense set forth in § c and the new value defense available in  § c the plaintiff also filed a motion to exclude certain invoices produced belatedly by defendant and offered as exhibits at trial trial of his matter was held july   and thereafter submitted to the court together with stipulated facts contained in the amended pretrial conference order the plaintifftrustee carl davis appeared in person defendant appeared by its counsel william h zimmerman of case moses zimmerman  wilson pa the court has reviewed the evidence and trial briefs submitted by the parties and is prepared to rule jurisdiction this is a core proceeding under  usc § bf over which this court has subject matter jurisdiction burden of proof because defendant stipulated at trial that plaintiff met all of the elements of a preference the burden of proof shifts to defendant on the § c exceptions to liability findings of fact before addressing the remaining facts and the defenses asserted in this case the court observes that the manner in which insurance premiums were billed to and paid by debtor in this case differs materially from the manner in which premium billings are typically handled between an insurer and an individual insuredpolicy holder the factual situation here warrants a brief explanation of the various parties and their relationship to one another debtor was involved in the restaurant business operating several amarillo mesquite grill restaurants in kansas and oklahoma defendant iphfha iphfha is an association of international pizza hut franchisees of which debtor is a member iphfha provides various services and benefits to its members including among them the right to purchase various lines of insurance coverage through iphfhas program at issue in this case is the commercial insurance coverage debtor obtained for its restaurants through iphfha ima of kansas inc ima is a full service insurance broker negotiated various lines of insurance coverage for iphfha members and administered the insurance program for iphfha members ima procured commercial insurance coverages for debtor through two insurers westport insurance corporation and chubb federal insurance company westport provided debtors commercial insurance package property general liability and auto and chubb provided debtors commercial umbrella excess coverage the westport coverages were billed and paid for in monthly installments while the chubb coverage was billed and paid on a quarterly basis as explained below ima issued the invoices  imas general counsel sue ann schultz testified at trial and explained the billing procedure for iphfha members participating in the insurance program ima first generates via its computer system the invoice for insurance premiums ima then replicates the invoice on iphfha letterhead manually overriding certain information on the internally generated invoice ie to whom to remit payment ima then sends the iphfha invoice to the franchise member and the member remits payment to an iphfha lock box iphfha maintains and periodically sweeps the lockbox and remits the lockbox proceeds together with a reconciliation to ima both the ima and iphfha invoices contained the following payment term premiums due and payable on effective date each invoice specified an effective date of the first day of the month imas history of the amarillo account went back to  the pay history received into evidence shows that debtor routinely paid the premiums for its various insurance coverages late but did not make any lump sum payments to catch up its account ms schultz indicated that an insured was in jeopardy of losing its coverage if it failed to pay the premiums before canceling coverage for nonpayment however the insurer was required by statute to issue a notice of intent to cancel to the insured according to ms schultz ima had the authority to issue such a notice but had never issued to debtor a notice of intent to cancel for nonpayment of premiums iphfhas employee ms carr corroborated the invoicing and payment procedure described by ms schultz at one time iphfha charged service fees for late premium payments but it discontinued the service fees in  ms carr acknowledged that debtor did incur some service fees for late payments but that iphfha did not view it as a problem account ms carr indicated that the three payments made by debtor to iphfha for insurance premiums prior to filing bankruptcy were not handled any differently than previous premium payments debtor had made with this factual background concerning the billing procedure for the insurance premiums the court now turns to the salient facts as stipulated by the parties westport issued the commercial package policy with amarillo as the named insured prior to amarillos bankruptcy according to the policy declarations page the policy period for the commercial insurance package procured from westport ran from july   to july   the payment schedule called for monthly installment payments iphfha billed amarillo three consecutive monthly premium installments of  each for the months of march april and may of  at the same time iphfha separately billed amarillo three consecutive monthly premium installments of  each for the months of march april  and may for the automobile coverage under the commercial package thus making the total monthly installment for the westport coverage  specifically invoice number  dated february   was the billing for the march installment installment  of  of the commercial package and invoice  was the billing for the commercial automobile coverage the effective date of both was march   and the premium was due and payable on the effective date iphfha billed amarillo invoice number  dated march   for the april installment installment  of  of the commercial package coverage and invoice  for the commercial automobile coverage the effective date of both was april   and the premium was due and payable on the effective date iphfha billed amarillo invoice number  dated april   for the may installment installment  of  of the commercial package coverage and invoice  for the commercial automobile coverage the effective date of both was may   and the premium was due and payable on the effective date according to the declarations page of the federal or chubb commercial umbrella coverage policy the policy period also ran from july   to july   it called for quarterly installment payments of premiums in the amount of  on march   iphfha billed amarillo invoice number  for the  quarterly installment of the umbrella coverage the effective date was april   and the premium was due and payable on the effective date the invoices are set forth in sequence in the chart below invoice due date days invoice date amount date recd check  late                                                           the trustee seeks to recover three checks drawn and issued by amarillo in payment  of the insurance premiums billed above check no check date amount date received  april    may    may    may    may    june     each of the checks was made payable to iphfha and sent to the bank of america lockbox location according to iphfhas pay history introduced at trial check number  was applied to invoice  check number  was applied to invoice numbers    and  and check number  was applied to invoice numbers  and  as indicated by the date the checks were received by iphfha and the effective dates of the invoices debtor paid each of the invoices  to  days late this was well within the range of days late reflected by amarillos pay history it is also apparent from the pay history that iphfha invoiced debtor for subsequent insurance premiums on may  june  and july  of  on june   iphfha swept its lockbox and sent the funds by wire transfer to ima for remittance to the insurers debtor commenced this case by filing a chapter  petition on may   on debtors motion the case was voluntarily converted to chapter  on september   plaintiff was appointed successor trustee and commenced this adversary proceeding against defendant on march   on june   iphfha produced for the first time to the trustee the invoices on iphfha letterhead marked at trial as defendants exhibit a and plaintiffs exhibit  the ima invoices had previously been provided to the trustee as explained at trial ima did not retain possession of a copy of the invoices on iphfha letterhead and had to go back and regenerate the iphfha invoices from its computer system in order to produce the same after hearing the explanation provided by ms schultz with respect to the preparation of the invoices the court is convinced that defendant has not impermissibly altered or improperly redacted the original ima invoices moreover the ima and iphfha invoices differ only in their payment remittance directions accordingly the court finds that the trustee has not been prejudiced by the belated production of the iphfha invoices and the trustees motion to exclude them from evidence in this proceeding is denied the court now turns its attention to the merits of iphfhas defenses to the preference claims  analysis a transfer under § b in order to be recovered as a preferential transfer a transfer must be made on or within  days before the date of the debtors bankruptcy petition the date of a transfer made by check is the date that check is honored not when it is delivered here two of the three checks were honored prepetition the third check  was not honored until june   well after the case was commenced on may   therefore only the earlier two checks issued and honored within the  period may be preferential transfers under § b b ordinary course of business § c section c sets forth the ordinary course of business exception to preference liability the trustee may not avoid as a preference a transfer that was a in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee b made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee and c made according to ordinary business terms for purposes of § c a transfer made by check of funds in a checking account occurs on the date the check is delivered rather than the date it was honored in this case the evidence presented was that the date of delivery occurred when the check was received at the bank of america lockbox as noted above the third check   was delivered and honored postpetition and therefore is not an avoidable preference under § b the other two checks were delivered to the lockbox prior to amarillos bankruptcy filing and are avoidable prepetition transfers unless the exceptions in § c are satisfied the purpose behind the ordinary course of business exception as noted in mclaughlin v hoole machine and engraving corp in re parkline corp is to protect recurring customary credit transactions which are incurred and paid in the ordinary course of business of the debtor and the transferee    and to leave undisturbed normal financial relations because such an exception does not detract from the general policy of the preference section to discourage unusual action by either the debtor or his creditor during the debtors slide into bankruptcy in re jolly n inc  br  at  bankrdnj quoting hrrep no  th cong st sess   reprinted in uscode cong and adminnews  pp    in the instant case there is no doubt that amarillos checks were in payment of a  debt incurred in the ordinary course of business of amarillo and iphfha amarillo incurred periodic charges for maintaining insurance coverage on its restaurant operations and part of iphfhas ordinary business was to service and administer insurance programs for its member franchisees iphfha through ima has serviced and administered the amarillo insurance account since at least  the first prong of § c is satisfied the remaining two prongs of the ordinary course exception were explained by the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap in payne v clarendon national insurance company in re sunset sales inc subsection b of this section § c creates a subjective test ie whether the transfers were ordinary as between the parties and subsection c creates an objective test ie whether the transfers were ordinary in the industry see eg in re midway airlines inc  fd   th cir  citing cases this defense should be narrowly construed jobin v mckay in re m  l bus mach co  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   the subjective inquiry of whether the transfers were made in the ordinary course of business of amarillo and iphfha considers the following factors  the length of time the parties have engaged in the type of dealing at issue  whether the subject transfer was in an amount more than usually paid  whether the payments were tendered in a manner different from previous payments  whether there appears any unusual action by either the debtor or creditor to collect or pay on the debt and  whether the creditor did anything to gain an advantage in light of the debtors deteriorating financial condition here the course of dealing between the parties established that ima had administered iphfhas commercial insurance program for debtor at least ten years ima generated the iphfha invoices and sent them to debtor approximately  days in advance of their due date the first of the month debtor routinely paid the invoices late anywhere from  days late to  days late exhibit d shows that each and every invoice since  was paid late by debtor most in the  day range the testimony at trial established that debtor incurred an unquantified amount of late fees until iphfha discontinued billing late fees in  the three payments at issue here were not in unusual amounts and referenced the invoices being paid as with all iphfha insurance premium invoices debtor remitted payment to a bank of america lockbox iphfha sent no dunning letters nor took any other action to collect the unpaid invoices there was no evidence that iphfha did anything to gain an advantage or even that it was aware of debtors deteriorating financial condition  in in re classic drywall inc the district court of kansas addressed late payments in the context of § c and stated while a payment late under the written terms of the parties agreement is a strong indicator of a preference this fact alone does not preclude an ordinary business exception several courts have found late payments satisfy the ordinary business exception where a consistent course of dealing between the parties over time can be shown the court concludes that iphfha has met the subjective inquiry that the transfers were ordinary between it and debtor as required by § cb the more difficult question for the court is whether iphfha has met its burden with respect to the objective test  whether the payments were ordinary in the industry ordinary business terms as used in § cc are terms used in normal financing relations the terms that creditors and debtors use in ordinary circumstances when debtors are healthy there was no evidence presented of insurance industry standards regarding late premium payments this is fatal to iphfhas ordinary course defense iphfha presented no evidence that it regularly accepted late payments from other franchise members and that it did not issue cancellation notices for other insureds who failed to remit payment on the due date iphfha presented no evidence that other franchise members routinely paid their insurance premium invoices  days late or as much as no and  days late iphfha presented no evidence that it routinely departed from the payment schedule set forth in the commercial policies with other franchise members no evidence was presented that other franchise members incurred late fees the only evidence remotely bearing on the industry standards was the testimony of ms schultz that insurers were required by kansas law to give ten  days notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premiums and that no notice of cancellation was ever sent to debtor the required statutory notice does not determine industry standards of payment terms or late payments in any event iphfha failed to present evidence that it was industry practice to not issue notice of cancellation where an insured was regularly and repeatedly  days late in paying their insurance premiums in short iphfha failed to present evidence that debtors late payments and its acceptance of those late payments were in accord with industry practices iphfhas ordinary course defense must therefore fail  because the third check at issue here is not a prepetition transfer iphfhas preference liability is  unless iphfha can prevail on the new value defense c contemporaneous exchange for new value § c section c provides that a trustee may not avoid a preferential transfer  to the extent that such transfer was  a intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and b in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange the rationale of this preference exception is to protect  transfers that do not result in a diminution of the estate  unsecured creditors are not harmed by the targeted transfer if the estate was replenished by an infusion of assets that are of roughly equal value to those that were transferred under § c iphfha must prove that it gave new value in exchange for each of amarillos payments that iphfha and amarillo intended each exchange to be contemporaneous and that each exchange was in fact substantially contemporaneous new value is defined by § a to include moneys worth in goods services or new credit congress did not set a specific time limit in § c for determining whether an exchange is substantially contemporaneous but rather provided a flexible standard based upon the circumstances the payment history of debtors insurance account indicates that debtors transfers on may  and may  were on account of past due premiums  insurance premiums that were due on march  and april  for insurance coverage for the months of march and april the record is devoid of any evidence that amarillo and iphfha intended the payments to be a contemporaneous exchange nor do these facts demonstrate in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange for new value as concluded in larose v bourg insurance agency in re dick henley inc the debtor receives no new value in this situation the payment was on account of performance by the insurance company relating to a period of time already elapsed    the reinstatement of the policy appears to have had no value to the debtor beyond the value already received the insurance company is simply an unsecured creditor of the debtor it refused to do further business with the debtor unless the account was brought current bringing an account current in such circumstances and thereby obtaining the right to do further business is not a contemporaneous exchange  had amarillo paid insurance premiums for insurance coverage during the same month as the coverage was provided it may have qualified as a substantially contemporaneous exchange but that was not the case here the payment of premiums for insurance coverage has been analogized to a lease payment    the payment for healthcare services is similar to payment under a lease just as a landlord provides the premises throughout the entire month hap provided new value in the form of healthcare services throughout the month in the context of leases many courts have found that payments made in the same month of occupancy are substantially contemporaneous as long as they were paid during the month they fell due citations omitted nor does the fact that the insurers continued to provide insurance coverage to amarillo or that amarillo continued in business after the transfers constitute new value for all of the foregoing reasons and based upon the state of the record before the court iphfha has not met its burden of proving that amarillos transfers were excepted as preferences under § c conclusion debtors payments by check number   and check number   were preferential transfers under § b and avoidable by the trustee debtors postpetition transfer by check number  was not a preference and is not avoidable under § b defendant iphfha has failed to meet its burden of proving that such transfers were excepted as preferences as transfers in the ordinary course of business under § c or as substantially contemporaneous exchanges for new value under § c the trustee is entitled to judgment on its complaint against defendant iphfha in the amount of  a judgment on decision shall issue this day notes  debtor filed its chapter  petition prior to the effective date of the bankruptcy abuse

ima estimated that there were  participants in the iphfha insurance program  there only difference between the ima and the iphfha invoices is the party to whom to remit payment to in all other
