new york ny ct app ace securities corp v db structured products inc ace securities corp v db structured products inc resetaa font size print court of appeals of new york ace securities corp  c appellant v db structured products inc respondent     decided june   paul d clement for appellant david j woll for respondent cxa– corporation association of mortgage investors association of financial guaranty insurers national credit union administration board lnr partners et al chamber of commerce of the united states of america et al securities industry and financial markets association mortgage bankers association steven l schwarcz ethan j leib et al federal home loan bank of boston et al amici curiae this appeal stems from a transaction involving residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs two certificateholders in the ace securities corp home equity loan trust series –sl the trust sued db structured products inc dbsp the sponsor of the transaction for failure to repurchase loans that allegedly did not conform to dbsps representations and warranties the trust later sought to substitute itself as plaintiff in place of the certificateholders the parties dispute the timeliness of this lawsuit whether the certificateholders or the trust complied with a condition precedent and whether the certificateholders possessed standing to sue or alternatively the trusts complaint cured any defect in the certificateholders standing we hold that the trusts cause of action against dbsp for breach of representations and warranties accrued at the point of contract execution on march   where as in this case representations and warranties concern the characteristics of their subject as of the date they are made they are breached if at all on that date dbsps refusal to repurchase the allegedly defective mortgages did not give rise to a separate cause of action additionally we hold that even assuming standing the two certificateholders did not validly commence this action because they failed to comply with the contractual condition precedent to suit namely affording dbsp  days to cure and  days to repurchase from the date of notice of the alleged nonconforming loansiin its role as sponsor of the securitization that is at the core of this case dbsp purchased  mortgage loans from at least three thirdparty mortgage originators this pool of loans was sold to an affiliate ace securities corp ace a securitization conduit known as a “depositor” pursuant to a mortgage loan purchase agreement mlpa executed between dbsp and ace ace then transferred the loans and its rights under the mlpa to the trust pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement psa the parties to the psa were ace as depositor ocwen loan servicing llc ocwen as servicer wells fargo bank national association wells fargo as master servicer and securities administrator and hsbc bank usa national association as trustee hsbc or the trustee dbsp was not a party or signatory to the psa except for two sections not relevant to this appeal its role was effectively complete at closing when it transferred via ace its “rights title and interest in to and under the mortgage loans” and the “contents of the related mortgage file” to the trustee and its agents the mlpa and psa were executed on the same day march  hsbc acted as trustee for the holders of  million in certificates issued by the trust and was authorized to bring suit on the trusts behalf the individual mortgage loans served as collateral for the certificates which paid principal and interest to certificateholders from the cash flow generated by the mortgage loan pool that is certificateholders made money when the borrowers made payments on their loansdbsp made over  representations and warranties in the mlpa regarding the credit quality and characteristics of the pooled loans “as of the closing date” march   the mlpa permitted the trust to examine each mortgage loan file and exclude from the final pool any loans that did not comply with dbsps representations and warranties but the mlpa also relieved the trust and certificateholders from any obligation to verify dbsps representations and warranties or to conduct due diligence on the loan characteristics importantly the trusts “sole remedy ” in the event dbsp “breached any of the representations and warranties contained in” the mlpa was for dbsp to cure or repurchase a nonconforming loanthe psa authorized the trustee to enforce the repurchase obligation in the following way if hsbc learned of a breach of a representation or warranty it was required to “promptly notify dbsp and the servicer” of the breach and request that dbsp cure the identified defect or breach within  days if dbsp did not cure the defect or breach in all material respects the trustee was empowered to “enforce the obligations of dbsp under the mlpa to repurchase such mortgage loan ․ within ninety  days after the date on which dbsp was notified of the breach” finally as relevant here the psa authorized certificate holders entitled to at least  of voting rights to enforce certain default events after first requesting in writing that the trustee institute an action and the trustee refused or neglected to do so within  daysa few years after the parties executed the mlpa and psa borrower defaults and delinquencies on individual mortgages caused the trust and certificateholders to lose almost  million two certificate holders rmbs recovery holdings  llc and vp structured products llc—independent investment funds which together held  of the voting certificates—hired a forensic mortgage loan review firm to review a portion of the loans in the trust ninetynine percent of the loans reviewed allegedly failed to comply with at least one of dbsps representations and warranties in the mlpa about borrowers incomes occupancy status or existing debt obligationsby letter dated january   the two certificateholders gave notice to hsbc of “breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage loans by the sponsor dbsp under the relevant psa and related trust documents” citing “the extremely high breach rates found in loan file reviews” the certificateholders “demanded that the mortgage loans in the trust in their entirety be put back to dbsp for repurchase including all of the individual defective loans uncovered during their investigation” emphasis added further the certificateholders alerted the trustee to “the urgent need for a tolling agreement ․ in light of potential expiring statute of limitations deadlines” and expressed their belief that “it was imperative that the trustee act expeditiously to request such an agreement” when the trustee neither sought a tolling agreement nor brought suit against dbsp the two certificateholders sued dbsp on march  —six years to the day from the date of contract execution—by filing a summons with notice on behalf of the trust the summons with notice alleged a single cause of action for breach of contract based on dbsps alleged material breach of representations and warranties and failure to comply with its contractual repurchase obligation the certificateholders asked for specific performance and damages to the tune of  millionon september   the trustee sought to substitute for the certificateholders and filed a complaint on the trusts behalf in the complaint the trust alleged breaches of representations and warranties and dbsps refusal to comply with its repurchase obligation the trust asserted that it had promptly notified dbsp of the breaches of representations and warranties on february  march  april  april  may  may  may  june  and july   and that each of these notices specified the defective or nonconforming loans detailed specific breaches for each loan and supplied supporting documentation the trust suggested that the presuit –and –day condition precedent was satisfied because as of the date of its complaint dbsp had still not repurchased any loans and “refused to recognize the notices of breach as sufficient to trigger dbsps cure or repurchase obligations”on november   dbsp moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely arguing that the trustees claims accrued as of march   more than six years before the trust filed its complaint moreover dbsp contended that the certificateholders summons and notice was a nullity because they did not give dbsp  days to cure and  days to repurchase before bringing suit that the certificateholders lacked standing because only the trustee was authorized to sue for breaches of representations and warranties and that the trustees substitution could not relate back to march   because there was no valid preexisting actionsupreme court denied dbsps motion to dismiss  miscd  sup ct ny county   the judge reasoned that dbsp could not have breached its repurchase obligations until it “failed to timely cure or repurchase a loan following discovery or receipt of notice of a breach of a representation or warranty” id at  in supreme courts view “the whole point of how the mlpa and psa were structured was to shift the risk of noncomplying loans onto dbsp” id at  thus the argument “that the trustees claims accrued in  ․ utterly belies the parties relationship and turned the psa on its head” id the court concluded instead that dbsps cure or repurchase obligation was recurring and that dbsp committed an independent breach of the psa each time it failed to cure or repurchase a defective loan therefore the judge held the trusts action to be timely supreme court also determined that the trust had satisfied the condition precedent to suit insofar as dbsp affirmatively repudiated any obligation to repurchasethe appellate division reversed and granted dbsps motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely  add  st dept   the court held that “the claims accrued on the closing date of the mlpa march   when any breach of the representations and warranties contained therein occurred” id at  further although the certificateholders commenced their action on march   the last day of the sixyear statute of limitations for contract causes of action the – and –day periods for cure and repurchase had not by then elapsed accordingly the certificateholders “failed to comply with a condition precedent to commencing suit that rendered their summons with notice a nullity” id the appellate division added that in any event the certificateholders lacked standing to commence the action on behalf of the trust and the trusts substitution did not cure that defect and relate back to the certificateholders date of filingon june   we granted the trust leave to appeal  nyd    we now affirmiiaccrualour statutes of limitation serve the same objectives of finality certainty and predictability that new yorks contract law endorses statutes of limitation not only save litigants from defending stale claims but also “express  a societal interest or public policy of giving repose to human affairs” john j kassner  co v city of new york  nyd    internal citations and quotation marks omitted  and we have repeatedly “rejected accrual dates which cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty in favor of a bright line approach” mri broadway rental v united states min prods co  nyd    accordingly new york does not apply the “discovery” rule to statutes of limitations in contract actions ely–cruikshank co v bank of montreal  nyd     rather the “statutory period of limitations begins to run from the time when liability for wrong has arisen even though the injured party may be ignorant of the existence of the wrong or injury” id citations omitted  this is so even though the result may at times be “harsh and manifestly unfair and creates an obvious injustice” because a contrary rule “would be entirely dependent on the subjective equitable variations of different judges and courts instead of the objective reliable predictable and relatively definitive rules that have long governed this aspect of commercial repose” id indeed “to extend the highly exceptional discovery notion to general breach of contract actions would effectively eviscerate the statute of limitations in this commercial dispute arena” id we applied the same brightline rule just three years ago in the insurance context with respect to retrospective premiums holding that breach of contract counterclaims “began to run when insurers possessed the legal right to demand payment from the insured” not years later when they actually made the demand hahn automotive warehouse inc v american zurich ins co  nyd    the trust does not dispute this precedent but rather seeks to persuade us that its claim did not arise until dbsp refused to cure or repurchase at which point the trust either through the trustee or the certificateholders had six years to bring suit thus the trust views the repurchase obligation as a distinct and continuing obligation that dbsp breached each time it refused to cure or repurchase a nonconforming loan stated another way the trust considers the cure or repurchase obligation to be a separate promise of future performance that continued for the life of the investment ie the mortgage loansalthough parties may contractually agree to undertake a separate obligation the breach of which does not arise until some future date the repurchase obligation undertaken by dbsp does not fit this description to support its contrary position the trust relies on our decision in bulova watch co v celotex corp  nyd    where we considered whether the separate repair clause in a contract for the sale of a roof constituted a future promise of performance the breach of which created a cause of action the separate clause the seller included in that contract was a “–year guaranty bond” which “expressly guaranteed that the seller would ‘at its own expense make any repairs ․ that may become necessary to maintain said roof’ “ id at we held that the guarantee “embodied an agreement distinct from the contract to supply roofing materials” the breach of which triggered the statute of limitations anew id at  this was so because the defendant in bulova watch “did not merely guarantee the condition or performance of the goods but agreed to perform a service” id at  that service was the separate and distinct promise to repair a defective roof—a critical component of the parties bargain and “a special separate and additional incentive to purchase” the defendants product id at  accordingly the “agreements contemplating services  were subject to a sixyear statute   running separately for the damages occasioned each time a breach of the obligation to repair the bonded roof occurred” idthe remedial clause in bulova watch expressly guaranteed future performance of the roof and undertook a promise to repair the roof if it did not satisfy the sellers guarantee dbsp by contrast never guaranteed the future performance of the mortgage loans it represented and warranted certain facts about the loans characteristics as of march   when the mlpa and psa were executed and expressly stated that those representations and warranties did not survive the closing date dbsps cure or repurchase obligation was the trusts remedy for a breach of those representations and warranties not a promise of the loans future performance in fact nothing in the contract specified that the cure or repurchase obligation would continue for the life of the loans unlike the separate guarantee in bulova watch dbsps cure or repurchase obligation could not reasonably be viewed as a distinct promise of future performance it was dependent on and indeed derivative of dbsps representations and warranties which did not survive the closing and were breached if at all on that date and it makes sense that dbsp as sponsor and seller would not guarantee future performance of the mortgage loans a sponsor does not guarantee payment for the life of the transaction because loans may default  or  years after they have been issued for reasons entirely unrelated to the sponsors representations and warranties the sponsor merely warrants certain characteristics of the loans and promises that if those warranties and representations are materially false it will cure or repurchase the nonconforming loans within the same statutory period in which remedies for breach of contract ie rescission and expectation damages could have been sought if the cure or repurchase obligation did not exist the trusts only recourse would have been to bring an action against dbsp for breach of the representations and warranties that action could only have been brought within six years of the date of contract execution the cure or repurchase obligation is an alternative remedy or recourse for the trust but the underlying act the trust complains of is the same the quality of the loans and their conformity with the representations and warranties the trust argues in effect that the cure or repurchase obligation transformed a standard breach of contract remedy ie damages into one that lasted for the life of the investment—decades past the statutory period but nothing in the parties agreement evidences such an intent historically we have been “extremely reluctant to interpret an agreement as impliedly stating something which the parties have neglected to specifically include․ courts may not by construction add or excise terms nor distort the meanings of those used and thereby make a new contract for the parties under the guise of interpreting the writing” vermont teddy bear co v  madison realty co  nyd    internal quotation marks and citations omitted condition precedentthe trusts strongest argument is that the cure or repurchase obligation was a substantive condition precedent to suit that delayed accrual of the cause of action in that vein the trust claims it had no right at law to sue dbsp until dbsp refused to cure or repurchase the loans within the requisite time period only then did the psa permit the trust to bring suit to enforce that distinct contractual obligation while this argument is persuasivesounding we are unconvincedthe trust ignores the difference between a demand that is a condition to a partys performance and a demand that seeks a remedy for a preexisting wrong we observed the distinction over  years ago in dickinson v mayor of city of ny  ny     there we held that a –day statutory period during which the city of new york was free from litigation while it investigated claims did not affect accrual of the cause of action against the city in such a case where a legal wrong occurred and the only impediment to recovery is the defendants discovery of the wrong and notice to the defendant the claim accrues immediately we contrasted that situation however to one in which “a demand ․ was a part of the cause of action and necessary to be alleged and proven and without this no cause of action existed” id at  distinguishing fisher v mayor of city of ny  ny   the trust suffered a legal wrong at the moment dbsp allegedly breached the representations and warranties this is like the situation in dickinson and unlike the situation in fisher where no cause of action existed until the demand was made here a cause of action existed for breach of a representation and warranty the trust was just limited in its remedies for that breach hence the condition was a procedural prerequisite to suit if dbsps repurchase obligation were truly the separate undertaking the trust alleges dbsp would not have breached the agreement until after the trust had demanded cure and repurchase but dbsp breached the representations and warranties in the parties agreement if at all the moment the mlpa was executed see eg abb indus sys v prime tech inc  f d   d cir under cplr  a warranty of compliance with environmental laws “was breached if at all on the day the contract was executed and therefore the district court correctly concluded that the statute began to run on that day west th owners corp v schlechter  add   st dept  “the representation ․ was false when made thus the breach occurred at the time of the execution of the contract”  the trust simply failed to pursue its contractual remedy within six years of the alleged breachthe only cases the trust relies on to support its position are inapposite the court in resolution trust corp v key financial serv inc  fd   st cir  specifically stated that it was not deciding the question of “whether or not the defendant committed an independent breach by failing to repurchase” id it affirmed the lower court on other grounds the other cases the trust cites either mistakenly rely on resolution trust as deciding something it expressly refrained from resolving see lasalle bank natl assn v lehman bros holdings  f supp d   d md  citing only resolution trust for the proposition that “a loan sellers failure to repurchase nonconforming loans upon demand as required by contract is an independent breach of the contract entitling plaintiff to pursue general contract remedies for breach of contract” lehman bros holdings inc v natl bank of arkansas  f supp d   ed ark  same  or rely on supreme courts decision in this case which the appellate division subsequently reversed see fhfa v wmc mtge llc  wl   sd ny dec   iiiin sum dbsps cure or repurchase obligation was not a separate and continuing promise of future performance rather it was the trusts sole remedy in the event of dpsps breach of representations and warranties viewed in this light the cure or repurchase obligation was not an independently enforceable right nor did it continue for the life of the investment accordingly the trusts claim subject to the sixyear statute of limitations for breachofcontract actions accrued on march   when the mlpa was executed moreover dbsps failure to cure or repurchase was not a substantive condition precedent that deferred accrual of the trusts claim instead it was a procedural prerequisite to suit finally because the trust admittedly failed to fulfill the condition precedent we need not and do not address the issues of standing and relation back disputed by the partiesaccordingly the order of the appellate division should be affirmed with costsorder affirmed with costsfootnotes  as servicer ocwen collected the mortgage payments from borrowers and contributed them to the trusts accounts and wells fargo the master servicer and securities administrator oversaw ocwen and was responsible for aggregating and distributing monthly payments and performance reports to certificateholders  tolling agreements are hardly unheardof in connection with rmbs loan repurchase or “putback” litigation for example jpmorgan chase executed one in november  with the trustees of several rmbs trusts as part of a massive settlement negotiation available at jpmorgans rmbs settlement website httpwwwrmbstrusteesettlementcom  the brief of amici curiae new york law professors helpfully analogizes the guarantees in this case and in bulova watch to ucc warranties under the new york ucc claims based on breaches of warranty are covered by a fouryear statute of limitations running from the date of delivery claims based on express guarantees of future performance by contrast are treated as arising on the future date when those express and separate guarantees are breached ny ucc law §§ –   the promise in bulova watch was an express guarantee of future performance whereas the cure or repurchase obligations in this case were directly tied to dbsps warranties and thus did not arise on a future date  even without reference to the appellate divisions decision in this case the overwhelming majority of courts agree that cure or repurchase provisions in similar mlpas do not give rise to a separate and independent cause of action that accrues on the date when the sponsor refuses to cure or repurchase individual loans see eg lehman bros holdings v universal am mtge co llc  wl  – d colo aug   no –civ– wells fargo bank na v jpmorgan

the united states of america et al securities industry and financial markets association mortgage bankers association steven l schwarcz ethan j leib et al federal home loan bank of boston et al amici curiae read j this appeal stems from a transaction involving residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs two certificateholders in the ace securities corp home equity loan trust series sl the trust sued db structured products inc dbsp the sponsor of the transaction for failure to repurchase loans that allegedly did not conform to dbsps representations and warranties the trust later sought to substitute itself as plaintiff in place of the certificateholders the parties dispute the timeliness of this lawsuit whether the certificateholders or the trust complied with a condition precedent and whether the certificateholders possessed standing to sue or alternatively the trusts complaint cured any defect in the certificateholders standing we hold that the trusts cause of action against dbsp for breach of representations and warranties accrued at the point of contract execution on march   where as in this case representations and warranties concern the characteristics of their subject as of the date they are made they are breached if at all on that date dbsps refusal to repurchase the allegedly defective mortgages did not give rise to a separate cause of action additionally we hold that even assuming standing the two certificateholders did not validly commence this action because they failed to comply with the contractual condition precedent to suit namely affording dbsp  days to cure and  days to repurchase from the date of notice of the alleged nonconforming loans i in its role as sponsor of the securitization that is at the core of this case dbsp purchased  mortgage loans from at least three thirdparty mortgage originators this pool of loans was sold to an affiliate ace securities corp ace a securitization conduit known as a depositor pursuant to a mortgage loan purchase agreement mlpa executed between dbsp and ace ace then transferred the loans and its rights under the mlpa to the trust pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement psa the parties to the psa were ace as depositor ocwen loan servicing llc ocwen as servicer wells fargo bank national association wells fargo as master servicer and securities administrator and hsbc bank usa national association as trustee hsbc or the trustee dbsp was not a party or signatory to the psa except for two sections not relevant to this appeal its role was effectively complete at closing when it transferred via ace its rights title and interest in to and under the mortgage loans and the contents of the related mortgage file to the trustee and its agents the mlpa and psa were executed on the same day march   hsbc acted as trustee for the holders of  million in certificates issued by the trust and was authorized to bring suit on the trusts behalf the individual mortgage loans served as collateral for the certificates which paid principal and interest to certificateholders from the cash flow generated by the mortgage loan poolfn that is certificateholders made money when the borrowers made payments on their loans dbsp made over  representations and warranties in the mlpa regarding the credit quality and characteristics of the pooled loans as of the closing date march   the mlpa permitted the trust to examine each mortgage loan file and exclude from the final pool any loans that did not comply with dbsps representations and warranties but the mlpa also relieved the trust and certificateholders from any obligation to verify dbsps representations and warranties or to conduct due diligence on the loan characteristics importantly the trusts sole remedy in the event dbsp breached any of the representations and warranties contained in the mlpa was for dbsp to cure or repurchase a nonconforming loan the psa authorized the trustee to enforce the repurchase obligation in the following way if hsbc learned of a breach of a representation or warranty it was required to promptly notify dbsp and the servicer of the breach and request that dbsp cure the identified defect or breach within  days if dbsp did not cure the defect or breach in all material respects the trustee was empowered to enforce the obligations of dbsp under the mlpa to repurchase such mortgage loan    within ninety  days after the date on which dbsp was notified of the breach finally as relevant here the psa authorized certificate holders entitled to at least  of voting rights to enforce certain default events after first requesting in writing that the trustee institute an action and the trustee refused or neglected to do so within  days a few years after the parties executed the mlpa and psa borrower defaults and delinquencies on individual mortgages caused the trust and certificateholders to lose almost  million two certificate holders rmbs recovery holdings  llc and vp structured products llc — independent investment funds which together held  of the voting certificates  hired a forensic mortgage loan review firm to review a portion of the loans in the trust ninetynine percent of the loans reviewed allegedly failed to comply with at least one of dbsps representations and warranties in the mlpa about borrowers incomes occupancy status or existing debt obligations by letter dated january   the two certificateholders gave notice to hsbc of breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage loans by the sponsor dbsp under the relevant psa and related trust documents citing the extremely high breach rates found in loan file reviews the certificateholders demanded that the mortgage loans in the trust in their entirety be put back to dbsp for repurchase including all of the individual defective loans uncovered during their investigation emphasis added further the certificateholders alerted the trustee to the urgent need for a tolling agreement    in light of potential expiring statute of limitations deadlines and expressed their belief that it was imperative that the trustee act expeditiously to request such an agreementfn when the trustee neither sought a tolling agreement nor brought suit against dbsp the two certificateholders sued dbsp on march    six years to the day from the date of contract execution  by filing a summons with notice on behalf of the trust the summons with notice alleged a single cause of action for breach of contract based on dbsps alleged material breach of representations and warranties and failure to comply with its contractual repurchase obligation the certificateholders asked for specific performance and damages to the tune of  million on september   the trustee sought to substitute for the certificateholders and filed a complaint on the trusts behalf in the complaint the trust alleged breaches of representations and warranties and dbsps refusal to comply with its repurchase obligation the trust asserted that it had promptly notified dbsp of the breaches of representations and warranties on february  march  april  april  may  may  may  june  and july   and that each of these notices specified the defective or nonconforming loans detailed specific breaches for each loan and supplied supporting documentation the trust suggested that the presuit  and day condition precedent was satisfied because as of the date of its complaint dbsp had still not repurchased any loans and refused to recognize the notices of breach as sufficient to trigger dbsps cure or repurchase obligations on november   dbsp moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely arguing that the trustees claims accrued as of march   more than six years before the trust filed its complaint moreover dbsp contended that the certificateholders summons and notice was a nullity because they did not give dbsp  days to cure and  days to repurchase before bringing suit that the certificateholders lacked standing because only the trustee was authorized to sue for breaches of representations and warranties and that the trustees substitution could not relate back to march   because there was no valid preexisting action supreme court denied dbsps motion to dismiss  misc d  sup ct ny county  the judge reasoned that dbsp could not have breached its repurchase obligations until it failed to timely cure or repurchase a loan following discovery or receipt of notice of a breach of a representation or warranty id at  in supreme courts view the whole point of how the mlpa and psa were structured was to shift the risk of noncomplying loans onto dbsp id at  thus the argument that the trustees claims accrued in     utterly belies the parties relationship and turned the psa on its head id the court concluded instead that dbsps cure or repurchase obligation was recurring and that dbsp committed an independent breach of the psa each time it failed to cure or repurchase a defective loan therefore the judge held the trusts action to be timely supreme court also determined that the trust had satisfied the condition precedent to suit insofar as dbsp affirmatively repudiated any obligation to repurchase the appellate division reversed and granted dbsps motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely  add  st dept  the court held that the claims accrued on the closing date of the mlpa march   when any breach of the representations and warranties contained therein occurred id at  further although the certificateholders commenced their action on march   the last day of the sixyear statute of limitations for contract causes of action the  and day periods for cure and repurchase had not by then elapsed accordingly the certificateholders failed to comply with a condition precedent to commencing suit that rendered their summons with notice a nullity id the appellate division added that in any event the certificateholders lacked standing to commence the action on behalf of the trust and the trusts substitution did not cure that defect and relate back to the certificateholders date of filing on june   we granted the trust leave to appeal  nyd   we now affirm ii accrual our statutes of limitation serve the same objectives of finality certainty and predictability that new yorks contract law endorses statutes of limitation not only save litigants from defending stale claims but also express a societal interest or public policy of giving repose to human affairs john j kassner  co v city of new york  nyd    internal citations and quotation marks omitted and we have repeatedly rejected accrual dates which cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty in favor of a bright line approach mri broadway rental v united states min prods co  nyd    accordingly new york does not apply the discovery rule to statutes of limitations in contract actions elycruikshank co v bank of montreal  nyd    rather the statutory period of limitations begins to run from the time when liability for wrong has arisen even though the injured party may be ignorant of the existence of the wrong or injury id citations omitted this is so even though the result may at times be harsh and manifestly unfair and creates an obvious injustice because a contrary rule would be entirely dependent on the subjective equitable variations of different judges and courts instead of the objective reliable predictable and relatively definitive rules that have long governed this aspect of commercial repose id indeed to extend the highly exceptional discovery notion to general breach of contract actions would effectively eviscerate the statute of limitations in this commercial dispute arena id we applied the same brightline rule just three years ago in the insurance context with respect to retrospective premiums holding that breach of contract counterclaims began to run when insurers possessed the legal right to demand payment from the insured not years later when they actually made the demand hahn automotive warehouse inc v american zurich ins co  nyd    the trust does not dispute this precedent but rather seeks to persuade us that its claim did not arise until dbsp refused to cure or repurchase at which point the trust either through the trustee or the certificateholders had six years to bring suit thus the trust views the repurchase obligation as a distinct and continuing obligation that dbsp breached each time it refused to cure or repurchase a nonconforming loan stated another way the trust considers the cure or repurchase obligation to be a separate promise of future performance that continued for the life of the investment ie the mortgage loans although parties may contractually agree to undertake a separate obligation the breach of which does not arise until some future date the repurchase obligation undertaken by dbsp does not fit this description to support its contrary position the trust relies on our decision in bulova watch co v celotex corp  nyd   where we considered whether the separate repair clause in a contract for the sale of a roof constituted a future promise of performance the breach of which created a cause of action the separate clause the seller included in that contract was a year guaranty bond which expressly guaranteed that the seller would at its own expense make any repairs    that may become necessary to maintain said roof id at  we held that the guarantee embodied an agreement distinct from the contract to supply roofing materials the breach of which triggered the statute of limitations anew id at  this was so because the defendant in bulova watch did not merely guarantee the condition or performance of the goods but agreed to perform a service id at  that service was the separate and distinct promise to repair a defective roof  a critical component of the parties bargain and a special separate and additional incentive to purchase the defendants product id at  accordingly the agreements contemplating services were subject to a sixyear statute  running separately for the damages occasioned each time a breach of the obligation to repair the bonded roof occurred id the remedial clause in bulova watch expressly guaranteed future performance of the roof and undertook a promise to repair the roof if it did not satisfy the sellers guarantee dbsp by contrast never guaranteed the future performance of the mortgage loans it represented and warranted certain facts about the loans characteristics as of march   when the mlpa and psa were executed and expressly stated that those representations and warranties did not survive the closing date dbsps cure or repurchase obligation was the trusts remedy for a breach of those representations and warranties not a promise of the loans future performance in fact nothing in the contract specified that the cure or repurchase obligation would continue for the life of the loans unlike the separate guarantee in bulova watch dbsps cure or repurchase obligation could not reasonably be viewed as a distinct promise of future performance it was dependent on and indeed derivative of dbsps representations and warranties which did not survive the closing and were breached if at all on that datefn and it makes sense that dbsp as sponsor and seller would not guarantee future performance of the mortgage loans a sponsor does not guarantee payment for the life of the transaction because loans may default  or  years after they have been issued for reasons entirely unrelated to the sponsors representations and warranties the sponsor merely warrants certain characteristics of the loans and promises that if those warranties and representations are materially false it will cure or repurchase the nonconforming loans within the same statutory period in which remedies for breach of contract ie rescission and expectation damages could have been soughtfn if the cure or repurchase obligation did not exist the trusts only recourse would have been to bring an action against dbsp for breach of the representations and warranties that action could only have been brought within six years of the date of contract execution the cure or repurchase obligation is an alternative remedy or recourse for the trust but the underlying act the trust complains of is the same the quality of the loans and their conformity with the representations and warranties the trust argues in effect that the cure or repurchase obligation transformed a standard breach of contract remedy ie damages into one that lasted for the life of the investment  decades past the statutory period but nothing in the parties agreement evidences such an intent historically we have been extremely reluctant to interpret an agreement as impliedly stating something which the parties have neglected to specifically include    courts may not by construction add or excise terms nor distort the meanings of those used and thereby make a new contract for the parties under the guise of interpreting the writing vermont teddy bear co v  madison realty co  nyd    internal quotation marks and citations omitted condition precedent the trusts strongest argument is that the cure or repurchase obligation was a substantive condition precedent to suit that delayed accrual of the cause of action in that vein the trust claims it had no right at law to sue dbsp until dbsp refused to cure or repurchase the loans within the requisite time period only then did the psa permit the trust to bring suit to enforce that distinct contractual obligation while this argument is persuasivesounding we are unconvinced the trust ignores the difference between a demand that is a condition to a partys performance and a demand that seeks a remedy for a preexisting wrong we observed the distinction over  years ago in dickinson v mayor of city of ny  ny    there we held that a day statutory period during which the city of new york was free from litigation while it investigated claims did not affect accrual of the cause of action against the city in such a case where a legal wrong occurred and the only impediment to recovery is the defendants discovery of the wrong and notice to the defendant the claim accrues immediately we contrasted that situation however to one in which a demand    was a part of the cause of action and necessary to be alleged and proven and without this no cause of action existed id at  distinguishing fisher v mayor of city of ny  ny   the trust suffered a legal wrong at the moment dbsp allegedly breached the representations and warranties this is like the situation in dickinson and unlike the situation in fisher where no cause of action existed until the demand was made here a cause of action existed for breach of a representation and warranty the trust was just limited in its remedies for that breach hence the condition was a procedural prerequisite to suit if dbsps repurchase obligation were truly the separate undertaking the trust alleges dbsp would not have breached the agreement until after the trust had demanded cure and repurchase but dbsp breached the representations and warranties in the parties agreement if at all the moment the mlpa was executed see eg abb indus sys v prime tech inc  f d   d cir  under cplr   a warranty of compliance with environmental laws was breached if at all on the day the contract was executed and therefore the district court correctly concluded that the statute began to run on that day west th owners corp v schlechter  add   st dept  the representation    was false when made thus the breach occurred at the time of the execution of the contract the trust simply failed to pursue its contractual remedy within six years of the alleged breach the only cases the trust relies on to support its position are inapposite the court in resolution trust corp v key financial serv inc  fd   st cir  specifically stated that it was not deciding the question of whether or not the defendant committed an independent breach by failing to repurchase id it affirmed the lower court on other grounds the other cases the trust cites either mistakenly rely on resolution trust as deciding something it expressly refrained from resolving see lasalle bank natl assn v lehman bros holdings  f supp d   d md  citing only resolution trust for the proposition that a loan sellers failure to repurchase nonconforming loans upon demand as required by contract is an independent breach of the contract entitling plaintiff to pursue general contract remedies for breach of contract lehman bros holdings inc v natl bank of arkansas  f supp d   ed ark  same or rely on supreme courts decision in this case which the appellate division subsequently reversed see fhfa v wmc mtge llc  wl   sd ny dec   iii in sum dbsps cure or repurchase obligation was not a separate and continuing promise of future performance rather it was the trusts sole remedy in the event of dpsps breach of representations and warranties viewed in this light the cure or repurchase obligation was not an independently enforceable right nor did it continue for the life of the investment accordingly the trusts claim subject to the sixyear statute of limitations for breachofcontract actions accrued on march   when the mlpa was executed moreover dbsps failure to cure or repurchase was not a substantive condition precedent that deferred accrual of the trusts claim instead it was a procedural prerequisite to suit finally because the trust admittedly failed to fulfill the condition precedent we need not and do not address the issues of standing and relation back disputed by the parties accordingly the order of the appellate division should be affirmed with costs                  order affirmed with costs opinion by judge read chief judge lippman and judges pigott rivera stein and fahey concur judge abdussalaam took no part decided june   footnotes footnote as servicer ocwen collected the mortgage payments from borrowers and contributed them to the trusts accounts and wells fargo the master servicer and securities administrator oversaw ocwen and was responsible for aggregating and distributing monthly payments and performance reports to certificateholders footnote tolling agreements are hardly unheardof in connection with rmbs loan repurchase or putback litigation for example jpmorgan chase executed one in november  with the trustees of several rmbs trusts as part of a massive settlement negotiation available at jpmorgans rmbs settlement website httpwwwrmbstrusteesettlementcom footnote the brief of amici curiae new york law professors helpfully analogizes the guarantees in this case and in bulova watch to ucc warranties under the new york ucc claims based on breaches of warranty are covered by a fouryear statute of limitations running from the date of delivery claims based on express guarantees of future performance by contrast are treated as arising on the future date when those express and separate guarantees are breached ny ucc law §§   the promise in bulova watch was an express guarantee of future performance whereas the cure or repurchase obligations in this case were directly tied to dbsps warranties and thus did not arise on a future date footnote even without reference to the appellate divisions decision in this case the overwhelming majority of courts agree that cure or repurchase provisions in similar mlpas do not give rise to a separate and independent cause of action that accrues on the date when the sponsor refuses to cure or repurchase individual loans see eg lehman bros holdings v universal am mtge co llc  wl   d colo aug   no civ wells fargo bank na v jpmorgan chase bank na  wl   sd ny mar   no cv ace
