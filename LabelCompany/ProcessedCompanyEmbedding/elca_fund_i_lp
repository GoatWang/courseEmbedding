not walls racial justice ministries social issues volunteer opportunities homefaithfaitha living daring confidence in god’s grace when lutherans talk about faith we are talking about the relationship god’s holy spirit creates with us it’s a relationship where god’s promise of steadfast love and mercy in jesus opens us to a life of bold trust in god and joyful generous service to everyone we know and meet in daily life martin luther was exuberant when he described the freedom of “a living daring confidence in god’s grace so sure and certain that believers would stake their lives on it a thousand times” he once wrote “oh it is a living busy active mighty thing this faith it is impossible for it not to be doing good things unceasingly” faith convictions expressed as statements of belief flow from this confident trust in god elca lutherans share in the faith expressed in the apostles’ nicene and athanasian creeds in the lutheran confessional writings collected as the book of concord and in the elca confession of faith at the same time faith does not close our minds to the world and our hearts to others we continue to listen to the scriptures of the old and new testaments we listen to the witness of others and we watch for the ways god is active in the world around us faith opens a place for engaging others in conversation for seeking the truth for asking questions and
