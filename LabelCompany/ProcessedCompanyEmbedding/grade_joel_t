houstonbased sysco corp as a staff auditor in  joel grade has not only held a variety of finance positions but has also worked as president of sysco canada and as a regional senior vice president of foodservice operations those experiences he says have shaped his rollupyoursleeves view of finance and informed him on how finance can help drive the company’s growth in this conversation with tom bendert principal with deloitte consulting llp mr grade discusses why he thinks sysco is wellpositioned to build on its year legacy as it continues to work toward improving the customer experience enhancing associate engagement and achieving financial objectives tom bendert joel what are the top priorities for sysco joel grade at sysco’s investor day in september  we laid out a threeyear strategic plan intended to achieve a gain in operating income of at least  million halfway through we are actually outperforming our goals so the new target is  million to  million our strategy is based on several pillars that we refer to as the “ p’s”— partnership productivity products people and portfolio within each of these we have specific objectives to drive the customer experience and be more productive in everything we do for example we have invested in a shared services center that while still in its early stages is allowing us to provide more consistent service to our customers while taking transactional work out of the field similarly we are finding ways to better utilize technology to make our sales force more productive such as eliminating manual order taking and other administrative tasks so that salespeople can spend more time selling improving productivity across the organization is something we approach very holistically because it is so closely tied to growth by understanding what we do where we do it and how we do it we can gain leverage out of our cost structure and reinvest the savings we achieve into the business to drive growth our ultimate aim is to invest in people technology and process to enhance our customer experience and make our business more competitive and differentiated tom bendert what support do you as cfo and your finance team provide in these efforts joel grade part of my responsibility in conjunction with other team members is to help increase productivity by determining where we can invest to both grow our business and drive costs out of our system one way we do that is by having finance very much integrated into the business we have people who support the sales function merchandising marketing business technology supply chain and other areas in order to achieve that in addition we have our locations in the field in which there is a regional structure with a finance leader to support the teams in those local markets i find people—whether in the supply chain marketing sales or some other function—have many great ideas but to effectively monetize them finance needs to be closely involved in order to say “that makes sense but have you considered x” or “what can we also do here” that’s the expectation i have for my people to work as part of the solution and to help make sure that we get the most out of the investments we make whether it’s a marketing campaign a new customer contract or venturing into a new market segment our finance team is also focused on capital allocation issues—how we might reinvest in the business return value to shareholders in the form of dividends pursue ma pay down debt and so on tom bendert how does ma fit into sysco’s growth strategy and what role does finance play joel grade ma is a key capital allocation priority and we think of it in three buckets one is around our core north american business which has been our primary market our approach to ma here is mostly for smaller foldinandtuckin deals either to broaden our geographies or to broaden our capabilities and product lines our product line is diverse from mop handles to lobster tails so we look for companies that have products—and importantly expertise—in say produce or meat or seafood i’d call those corebusiness acquisitions the second bucket is around adjacencies products or services that complement our business such as hotel amenities and the third bucket is around international as geographic expansion is an important part of our overall strategy historically our approach has been to do a couple of larger transformative deals and then build around them last year we acquired the brakes group in europe and we continue to expand in latin america and in the caribbean finance is closely involved across the entire ma process from analyzing prospective deals to financing the transaction to supporting the integration work including integrating the acquired company’s finance processes we also work closely with our investor relations team to represent the transaction to the marketplace and put it in the context of our overall growth story tom bendert given the expanding scope of what sysco sells and to whom how do you keep pace with customers’ expectations joel grade sysco has always been a customercentric organization—­it’s ingrained in our dna and we are always evolving our capabilities we realize that every market we operate in has unique needs whether it’s miami florida or lyon france we’ve made technology investments that enable us to serve our customers much more consistently and efficiently we also have a team of finance people who support our merchandising organization specifically around category management for example they provide analytics and related support to help determine the opportunities and pitfalls in different product categories although the finance team doesn’t make decisions on specific products they partner with merchandising colleagues to identify opportunities and risks they also assess opportunities and trends where finance can provide insight tom bendert how does your international expansion impact the composition of your investor base joel grade sysco has always had a very international shareholder base­—it’s about  now which is well above average for what we regard as our peer group our key shareholder base is longterm strategic investors there are some us shareholders who fit that description and that profile is also represented strongly in the european investor base and also in asia which is relatively small for us now during and after our acquisition of brakes we spent time in europe developing our story and getting our name out in places that have longterm highquality investors so as sysco’s world has expanded we have changed and evolved our investor outreach to include relatively frequent interaction with international investors when i think about communicating with investors regardless of market i think it’s all about being clear and consistent transparent and balanced and giving people the color behind the business so that they understand the full context i believe in talking about the “good the bad and the ugly” focusing on the “why” of what you’re doing and holding yourselves accountable tom bendert how does your goal to embed finance into the business influence your talent development strategy joel grade we don’t have an ivorytower culture in finance rather we have people who combine financial skills with a desire to really participate in the business and so we need sharp innovative analytical people who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty for people who want to move around and gain diverse experiences we provide opportunities to do that and providing opportunities is at the core of how i think about talent development for example somebody can come here and get experience working handinhand with sales with merchandising with supply chain and also gain experience in our field organization among other areas we don’t have a formal rotation program but we do create detailed individual development plans we also emphasize coaching and try to help people to maximize their performance and meet their career goals tom bendert you have a strong operations background and a long tenure at sysco how has that shaped your approach to the cfo role joel grade both of those factors are fundamental to how i operate a number of the people who serve as “market presidents” have worked for me at some point that has helped me build up credibility which can be helpful when reaching out into the field organization and influencing a decision they know that i understand our markets and how our customers think when you’ve been out in the warehouses talking to night and day staff when you’ve spent time with the drivers and local suppliers and customers you gain a broader perspective it’s part of what helps finance be an active participant in helping drive our business my philosophy is we are all in sales we are all in operations and we all ultimately own this organization so don’t be a bystander editor’s note this article is part of an ongoing
