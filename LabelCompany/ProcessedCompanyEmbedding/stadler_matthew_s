information the huge glass boxes downtown could easily be kicked over like models pumped up with growth hormones huge and brittle air walking down the hill from where i live to downtown is like

densely inhabited inbetween landscape has a deep history in north america predating the arrival of european explorers which can be usefully articulated if we study indigenous history in the americas as urban history and  that new literature which springs from this history can help us occupy the inbetween landscapes fully and well these three arguments — advocacy for the relevance of sievertss analysis an insistence that indigenous history is urban history and a faith in the power of literature to shape an urban future — form the core of stadlers work on urbanism and sprawl publishing and public spaceedit at a  lecture in vitoria spain stadler described publication as the creation of a public  there is no preexisting public he went on the public is created through deliberate willful acts the circulation of texts discussions and gatherings in physical space and the maintenance of a related digital commons these construct a common space of conversation a public space which beckons a public into being this publication in its fullest sense  stadler maintains that the public we think of when we speak of public opinion or mainstream is the manufactured product of special interests that use the publication to conjure a public that can justify their own selfinterests he cites the example of the public will conjured by the us government and news media to support that countrys  invasion of iraq publication is always a political act stadler argues it is imperative that we publish not only as a means to counter the influence of a hegemonic public but also to reclaim the space

collectivities and draw hope from them a year before stadlers first novel was released he began to run a writing class at his kitchen table in seattle he met there several writers artists and

times the new york times magazine spin magazine the village voice and many others but frustration with the narrow interests at this publication led stadler to focus on small startup journals and zines

 this condition of a densely inhabited inbetween landscape has a deep history in north america predating the arrival of european explorers which can be usefully articulated if we study indigenous history in the americas as urban history and  that new literature which springs from this history can help us occupy the inbetween landscapes fully and well these three arguments — advocacy for the relevance of sievertss analysis an insistence that indigenous history is urban history and a faith in the power of literature to shape an urban future — form the core of stadlers work on urbanism and sprawl publishing and public spaceedit at a  lecture in vitoria spain stadler described publication as the creation of a public  there is no preexisting public he went on the public is created through

of special interests that use the publication to conjure a public that can justify their own selfinterests he cites the example of the public will conjured by the us government and news media to support that countrys  invasion of iraq publication is always a political act stadler argues it is imperative that we publish not only as a means to counter the influence of a hegemonic public but also to reclaim the space in which we imagine ourselves and our collectivity we feel lonely and powerless when we accept the myth of the mainstream public when we accept that fiction we relinquish our ability to form our own collectivities and draw hope from them a year before stadlers first novel was released he began to run a writing class at his kitchen table in seattle he met there several

the city by edmund whitefeb   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story allan steinby matthew stadler pp new yorkgrove press writers today explore the boundary between fact and fiction in many ways some acknowledged and shared with the reader from the beginning others sprung on the reader unexpectedly theres nothing hidden or underhanded about matthew stadlers mix of fact and fiction in allan stein a firstperson narrator named matthew goes to paris pursuing information about allan stein gertrude steins unexceptional nephew who died long before in particular matthew hopes to find picassos missing  drawings of the boy which probably never existed the novel ends with a bibliography real not fictitious that lists  titles quoted in the text including seven earlythcentury travel books letters of members of the stein family memoirs of people who knew the steins and two of gertrude steins published works so much for the fact side of the equation although even in this domain the research is desultory and nonprofessional and the narrator finds in it what he wants toon the fiction side there is the story of an assumed identity as matthew takes on the name and occupation of a friend a museum curator named herbert widener and there is a love story between this false herbert and a yearold parisian named stephane a pursuit that roughly parallels matthews detective work into the life of allan stein this parallel is loosely encompassed by the haunting epigraph from gertrude stein what is the use of being a boy if you grow up to become a man what is the useto complicate the story further the narrator is constantly recalling his own past as a teenager he remembers a day by the sea when he was already erotically fascinated by a man his mother had just encountered on the beach the adult narrator halflusts after his own yearold self we might call this strategy the pedophilia of autobiography he also recalls his first trip to paris as an adolescent although he and his mother agreed to go their separate ways by day young matthew actually followed his mother everywhere now in the present of the novel  years later matthew tails stephane as the boy cycles rapidly through paris in both cases this secret shadowing takes on a sexual excitement for him as does his pursuit of allan stein through timealthough this book is organized around two obsessions for stephane and allan it manages despite its brevity to take in great swaths of experience  among other topics the international art scene stephanes bohemian frenchdutch family the natural splendor of the american pacific northwest but the obsessions form the thread that pulls us through the labyrinth of the city for allan stein belongs to a very old literary tradition the genre includes august strindbergs inferno knut hamsuns hunger andre bretons nadja and thomas mcguanes ninetytwo in the shade in each of them someone obsessed with love or in strindbergs case his own paranoid delusions discovers a city or town in an aleatory way advertisement continue reading the main story what makes allan stein unusual is the lyric suppleness and restraint of the writing a kind of mandarin american casualness that is peculiar to such west coast writers as dennis cooper dodie bellamy kevin killian and robert gluck a school of refined but deceptively offhand stylists matthew stadler is its newest star in allan stein we encounter the trademark passages of stark beauty alternating with throwaway references to pop culture when matthew sees stephane playing basketball he realizes the kid has picked up the mannerisms of africanamerican athletes an innercity slouch transmitted via music television like some kind of dybbuk bled from gray tin air into this thin french boys body and splitsecond channelchange style i found myself standing beside a jaded gangbanger sweetfaced just guessing really scopin for his homies newsletter sign

dissolution of nicholas dee pursues its subtle postmodernist course through the aftermath of gay fiction we might call what stadler  along with michael cunningham and dale peck  writes postgay fiction since these writers no longer seal off gay characters in a ghetto where the main goal is selfdefinition or public acceptance these novelists though quick to acknowledge their own homosexuality set their characters spinning through the great world sometimes the gay character is a minor one as in the hours by michael cunninghamin allan stein the narrator perhaps because he loves adolescents faintly despises adult homosexuals and heterosexuals i dont know why conservative drunk exhusbands in tract houses watching tv news exposes are so easily convinced the gay demimonde is sexsaturated and glamorous in fact it is just as tacky and crass as the worst gi shenanigans bar in the most sexless highway strip mall of the most forlorn suburban development    and if the terrific gains of gay liberation continue apace well soon be joining these straight potbellied swingles on the margins of those lane highways that seem to go on forever and ever into a false dusk of sodiumvapor lights love among adults and the inferno of the american mall are invoked only to contrast them with the paradise of paris and stephane on his bicycle i watched his strong legs his slim back and shoulders and saw everything i could ever love contained within the encyclopedic completeness of this solemn angel leading me into the evening traffic continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story that this novel has an aspect of lolita may trouble some readers though it is a lot less sexobsessed than lolita i was slightly put off by the gambit of the narrator posing as someone else it would have been so easy to eliminate this overly familiar complication but stadler has always gone in for postmodernist high jinks in the dissolution of nicholas dee the main character is writing a history of insurance that bizarrely evolves into the chronicle of the creation of an opera house in the thcentury netherlands allan stein may still bear the faint marks of such fussy experimentalism but it is powered by passion with it stadler demonstrates that he is among the handful of firstrate young american novelists one with a wide reach and a quirky elegant pen the writing and the composition of this evocation of the paris cityscape and its seductive denizens are remarkable continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think
