its investment objective an investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged you can lose money investing in this trust this trust terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any issuer’s dividend may vary from time to time investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the united states this may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries us or foreign tax treatment and the potential lack of liquidity government supervision and regulation stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information a portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors this trust is concentrated in the consumer products sectors some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings economic recession currency fluctuations changing consumer tastes extensive competition product liability litigation and increased government regulation no one can predict whether oil and natural gas prices will rise or fall in the future this may have an adverse impact on the value of certain securities in the trust and on the value of your units oil and natural gas prices are strongly affected by oil and gas supply and demand government regulations and policies oil and gas production and conservation efforts and technological change the oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs equipment supplies or qualified personnel or due to significant demand such as services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international charges opec policies changes in relationships among opec members and between opec and oil importing nations the

your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment therefore before investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when you invest in this trust because of these and other risks the trust should only represent a portion of your overall portfolio and you should consider an investment in the trust to be a part of a longer term investment strategy that will provide the best results when followed over a number of years there is no guarantee that the trust will achieve its investment objective market risk the risk that the market value of a bond or the trust may change rapidly and unpredictably causing the bond or the trust to be worth less than its original price volatility in the market price of the bonds in the trust changes the value of the units of the trust market value may be affected by a variety of factors including among others changes in the perceptions about the issuers changes in interest rates or inflation changes in the ratings of the issuers or changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the bonds because the trust is not managed bonds in the trust will generally not be sold in response to market fluctuations although bonds may be sold in certain limited circumstances accordingly an investor in the trust may be exposed to more market risk than an investor in certain managed investment vehicles inflation risk the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the value of the trusts assets can decline as can the value of the trusts distributions interest rate risk the risk that bonds will decline in value because of a rise in interest rates generally bonds will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise typically bonds with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk the risk that an issuer of a bond or an insurer is unable to meet its obligation to make interest and principal payments call risk the risk that bonds can be prepaid or called by the issuer before their stated maturity if bonds are called your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield also an early call at par of a premium bond will reduce your return bonds in the trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline this would result in early returns of principal to you and may result in early termination of the trust the dates and prices upon which the bonds are first subject to optional calls are provided in schedule of investments the bonds may also be subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and mandatory put features that may cause the bonds to be removed from the trust prior to maturity liquidity risk the risk that the value of the bonds may be reduced if trading in the bonds is limited or absent because the bonds will generally trade in the overthecounter market there can be no assurance that a liquid trading market will exist bond quality risk the risk that a reduction in a bonds rating may decrease its value and the value of your investment in the trust reduced diversification risk the risk that the diversification of your investment is reduced as bonds in the trust are called sold or mature this reduction in diversification may increase the risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses litigation and legislation risks the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of the trust in particular future tax legislation could affect the value of the trust by reducing tax rates imposing a flat or other form of tax exempting investment income from tax or changing the tax status of the bonds  year  risk like other investment companies financial and business organizations and individuals around the world the trust could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the sponsor or trustee or other service providers to the trust do not properly process and calculate daterelated information and data from and after january   this is commonly known as the year  problem the sponsor and trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address the year  problem with respect to computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the trusts other service providers at this time however there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the trust the year  problem is expected to impact corporations and other parties which may include issuers of the bonds contained in the trust to varying degrees based upon various factors including but not limited to their industry sector and degree of technological sophistication the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the year  problem will have on issuers or insurers of the bonds contained in the trust concentration risk the risk that the trust is less diversified and therefore subject to greater risk of loss because the trust is concentrated in a certain type of bond typically when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of the portfolio the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of health care facility revenue issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including increased governmental regulation fluctuating occupancy levels and increased competition in addition the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of education revenue issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including declines in college age individuals and the possible inability to raise tuition and fees the trust is concentrated in the bonds of issuers located in the state of arizona such concentration may expose unitholders to additional risks the financial condition of the state of arizona is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of the units additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations historically the state has experienced significant revenue shortfalls the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the economy of the state continues to be dependent on services tourism and manufacturing these sectors tend to be cyclical in  the value of arizona real estate began a steady decline reflecting a market which had been overbuilt in the previous decade with a resulting surplus of completed inventory this decline adversely affected both the construction industry and those arizona financial institutions which had aggressively pursued many facets of real estate lending in the near future arizonas financial institutions are likely to continue to experience problems until the excess inventories of commercial and residential properties are resolved the state is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning the various types of bonds contained in the trust is available in summary of portfolios in part b of the prospectus an additional discussion of potential risks may be obtained upon written or telephonic request to the trustee as described in other informationsupplemental information appearing in part b of this prospectus tax status for a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on trust units see what is the tax status of unitholders in part b of this prospectus the assets of the trust will consist of interestbearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the state of arizona the state its political subdivisions and authorities the arizona bonds and certain bonds issued by puerto rico authorities the possession bonds collectively the arizona bonds and possession bonds shall be referred to herein as the bonds provided the interest on such bonds received by the trust is exempt from state income taxes neither the sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held in the trust however although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters it is assumed that i the bonds were validly issued ii the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder would be exempt from the arizona income tax the arizona income tax we have assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to the arizona bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the bonds is exempt from the arizona income tax neither the sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith  in the opinion of chapman and cutler counsel to the sponsor under existing law for arizona income tax purposes each unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the trust and the income of the trust therefore will be treated as the income of the unitholder under state law for arizona income tax purposes interest on the arizona bonds which is excludable from federal gross income and which is exempt from arizona income taxes when received by the trust and which would be excludable from federal gross income and exempt from arizona income taxes if received directly by a unitholder will retain its status as taxexempt interest when received by the trust and distributed to the unitholders to the extent that interest derived from the trust by a unitholder with respect to the arizona bonds is excludable from federal gross income such interest will not be subject to arizona income taxes interest on the possession bonds which is excludible from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the trust will be exempt from arizona income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of the unitholders for income tax purposes when distributed by the trust and received by the unitholders each unitholder will receive taxable gain or loss for arizona income tax purposes when bonds held in the trust are sold exchanged redeemed or paid at maturity or when the unitholder redeems or sells units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for amortization of bond discount or premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the trust if later amounts paid by the insurer under an insurance policy or policies issued to the trust if any with respect to the bonds in the trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be exempt from state income taxes if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds arizona law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units in the trust the interest on which is exempt from arizona income taxes special rules apply to financial institutions and such institutions should consult their own tax advisors with respect to deductions of interest neither the bonds nor the units will be subject to arizona property taxes sales tax or use tax chapman and cutler has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provision of arizona law ownership of the units may result in collateral arizona tax consequences to certain taxpayers prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences volume incentives the sponsor has made substantial enhancements to

involves risk including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment therefore before investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when you invest in this trust because of these and other risks the trust should only represent a portion of your overall portfolio and you should consider an investment in the trust to be a part of a longer term investment strategy that will provide the best results when followed over a number of years there is no guarantee that the trust will achieve its investment objective market risk the risk that the market value of a bond or the trust may change rapidly and unpredictably causing the bond or the trust to be worth less than its original price volatility in the market price of the bonds in the trust changes the value of the units of the trust market value may be affected by a variety of factors including among others changes in the perceptions about the issuers changes in interest rates or inflation changes in the ratings of the issuers or changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the bonds because the trust is not managed bonds in the trust will generally not be sold in response to market fluctuations although bonds may be sold in certain limited circumstances accordingly an investor in the trust may be exposed to more market risk than an investor in certain managed investment vehicles inflation risk the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the value of the trusts assets can decline as can the value of the trusts distributions interest rate risk the risk that bonds will decline in value because of a rise in interest rates generally bonds will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise typically bonds with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk the risk that an issuer of a bond or an insurer is unable to meet its obligation to make interest and principal payments call risk the risk that bonds can be prepaid or called by the issuer before their stated maturity if bonds are called your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield also an early call at par of a premium bond will reduce your return bonds in the trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline this would result in early returns of principal to you and may result in early termination of the trust the dates and prices upon which the bonds are first subject to optional calls are provided in schedule of investments the bonds may also be subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and mandatory put features that may cause the bonds to be removed from the trust prior to maturity liquidity risk the risk that the value of the bonds may be reduced if trading in the bonds is limited or absent because the bonds will generally trade in the overthecounter market there can be no assurance that a liquid trading market will exist bond quality risk the risk that a reduction in a bonds rating may decrease its value and the value of your investment in the trust reduced diversification risk the risk that the diversification of your investment is reduced as bonds in the trust are called sold or mature this reduction in diversification may increase the risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses  litigation and legislation risks the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of the trust in particular future tax legislation could affect the value of the trust by reducing tax rates imposing a flat or other form of tax exempting investment income from tax or changing the tax status of the bonds year  risk like other investment companies financial and business organizations and individuals around the world the trust could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the sponsor or trustee or other service providers to the trust do not properly process and calculate daterelated information and data from and after january   this is commonly known as the year  problem the sponsor and trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address the year  problem with respect to computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the trusts other service providers at this time however there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the trust the year  problem is expected to impact corporations and other parties which may include issuers of the bonds contained in the trust to varying degrees based upon various factors including but not limited to their industry sector and degree of technological sophistication the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the year  problem will have on issuers or insurers of the bonds contained in the trust concentration risk the risk that the trust is less diversified and therefore subject to greater risk of loss because the trust is concentrated in a certain type of bond typically when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of the portfolio the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of education revenue issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including declines in college age individuals and the possible inability to raise tuition and fees the trust is concentrated in the bonds of issuers located in the state of colorado such concentration may expose unitholders to additional risks the financial condition of the state of colorado is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of the units additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations historically the state has experienced significant revenue shortfalls a recently passed but somewhat ambiguous constitutional amendment requires voter approval prior to tax increases creation of debt or until levy or valuation for assessment ratio increases the amendment also limits increases in government spending and property tax revenues to specified percentages the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the economy of the state continues to be dependent on tourism and its position as a transportation hub these sectors tend to be cyclical the state is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations further information concerning the various types of bonds contained in the trust is available in summary of portfolios in part b of the prospectus an additional discussion of potential risks may be obtained upon written or telephonic request to the trustee as described in other informationsupplemental information appearing in part b of this prospectus tax status for a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on trust units see what is the tax status of unitholders in part b of this prospectus in the opinion of sherman  howard llc special colorado counsel to the trust under existing law a trust will consist of obligations which were issued by the state of colorado or its political subdivisions or by the united states or possessions of the united states including puerto rico the virgin islands and guam colorado bonds because colorado income tax law is based upon the federal law and in light of the opinion of chapman and cutler the trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for purposes of colorado income taxation with respect to colorado unitholders in view of the relationship between federal and colorado tax computations described above and the opinion of chapman and cutler referred to above each colorado unitholder will be treated as owning a share of each asset of the trust for colorado income tax purposes in the proportion that the number of units of such trust held by him bears to the total number of outstanding units of the trust and the income of the trust will therefore be treated as the income of each colorado unitholder under colorado law in the proportion described  interest on colorado bonds that would not be subject to colorado income tax or colorado alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a colorado unitholder will not be subject to colorado income tax or alternative minimum tax when received by the trust and attributed to such colorado unitholder and when distributed to such colorado unitholder any proceeds paid under an insurance policy issued to the issuer of the colorado bonds involved to the depositor prior to deposit of the colorado bonds in the trust or to the trust which proceeds represent maturing interest on defaulted colorado bonds and which proceeds would not be subject to colorado income tax or alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a colorado unitholder will not be subject to colorado income and alternative minimum tax when received by the trust and attributed to such colorado unitholder and when distributed to such colorado unitholder generally each colorado unitholder will realize gain or loss taxable in colorado when the trust disposes of a colorado bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or when the colorado unitholder redeems or sells units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for amortization of bond discount or premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a colorado unitholders share of interest if any accruing on colorado bonds during the interval between the colorado unitholders settlement date and the date such colorado bonds are delivered to the trust if later however beginning in  a colorado unitholder who is an individual a trust or an estate may be able to exclude from colorado taxable income up to  per year  for a married couple filing jointly of gains from the trusts diposition of bonds or from the redemption or sale of the colorado unitholders units under legislation enacted by colorado in  interest income dividend income and net capital gains as defined in section  of the code otherwise includable in taxable income qualify for the exclusion the exclusion will be available only in years during which state revenues exceed by  million indexed annually to reflect the rate of growth in colorado personal income state spending limits mandated by the colorado constitution as such revenue and spending limits are described in the appendix to the information supplement entitled colorado disclosure under the caption economic factorscoloradorestrictions on appropriations and revenues tax cost reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in colorado unitholders realizing gain taxable in colorado when their units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost such gain may qualify for the exclusion from colorado taxable income described in the preceding paragraph during years in which the exclusion becomes available if interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a colorado unitholder to purchase units in the trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes it will not be deductible for colorado income tax purposes volume incentives the sponsor has made substantial enhancements to the volume incentive program for dealer firms currently described in part b of this prospectus the

distributions risk factors risk is inherent in all investing investing in a unit trust involves risk including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment therefore before investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when you invest in this trust because of these and other risks the trust should only represent a portion of your overall portfolio and you should consider an investment in the trust to be a part of a longer term investment strategy that will provide the best results when followed over a number of years there is no guarantee that the trust will achieve its investment objective market risk the risk that the market value of a bond or the trust may change rapidly and unpredictably causing the bond or the trust to be worth less than its original price volatility in the market price of the bonds in the trust changes the value of the units of the trust market value may be affected by a variety of factors including among others changes in the perceptions about the issuers changes in interest rates or inflation changes in the ratings of the issuers or changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the bonds because the trust is not managed bonds in the trust will generally not be sold in response to market fluctuations although bonds may be sold in certain limited circumstances accordingly an investor in the trust may be exposed to more market risk than an investor in certain managed investment vehicles inflation risk the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the value of the trusts assets can decline as can the value of the trusts distributions interest rate risk the risk that bonds will decline in value because of a rise in interest rates generally bonds will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise typically bonds with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk the risk that an issuer of a bond or an insurer is unable to meet its obligation to make interest and principal payments call risk the risk that bonds can be prepaid or called by the issuer before their stated maturity if bonds are called your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield also an early call at par of a premium bond will reduce your return bonds in the trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline this would result in early returns of principal to you and may result in early termination of the trust the dates and prices upon which the bonds are first subject to optional calls are provided in schedule of investments the bonds may also be subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and mandatory put features that may cause the bonds to be removed from the trust prior to maturity liquidity risk the risk that the value of the bonds may be reduced if trading in the bonds is limited or absent because the bonds will generally trade in the overthecounter market there can be no assurance that a liquid trading market will exist bond quality risk the risk that a reduction in a bonds rating may decrease its value and the value of your investment in the trust  reduced diversification risk the risk that the diversification of your investment is reduced as bonds in the trust are called sold or mature this reduction in diversification may increase the risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses litigation and legislation risks the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of the trust in particular future tax legislation could affect the value of the trust by reducing tax rates imposing a flat or other form of tax exempting investment income from tax or changing the tax status of the bonds year  risk like other investment companies financial and business organizations and individuals around the world the trust could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the sponsor or trustee or other service providers to the trust do not properly process and calculate daterelated information and data from and after january   this is commonly known as the year  problem the sponsor and trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address the year  problem with respect to computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the trusts other service providers at this time however there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the trust the year  problem is expected to impact corporations and other parties which may include issuers of the bonds contained in the trust to varying degrees based upon various factors including but not limited to their industry sector and degree of technological sophistication the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the year  problem will have on issuers or insurers of the bonds contained in the trust concentration risk the risk that the trust is less diversified and therefore subject to greater risk of loss because the trust is concentrated in a certain type of bond typically when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of the portfolio the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of water andor sewer revenue issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including problems obtaining timely and adequate rate increases and population decline resulting in decreased user fees the trust is concentrated in the bonds of issuers located in the state of florida such concentration may expose unitholders to additional risks the financial condition of the state of florida is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of the units additionally constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the state constitution and statutes mandate that the state budget as a whole and each separate fund within the state budget be kept in balance from currently available revenues each fiscal year additionally the state constitution prohibits issuance of state obligations to fund state operations the economic vitality of the state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors the state continues to be dependent on the construction and construction related manufacturing industries these industries tend to be highly cyclical and there is no assurance that floridas rapid population growth which drove these industries in the past will continue tourism is also one of the states most important industries because many international travelers visit florida an increase in the value of the us dollar adversely affects this industry moreover florida could be impacted by problems in the agricultural sector including crop failures severe weather conditions or other agriculturalrelated problems particularly with regard to the citrus and sugar industries the state is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations the state maintains a bond rating of aa aa and aa from moodys standard  poors and fitch respectively on the majority of its general obligation bonds although the rating of a particular series of revenue bonds relates primarily to the project facility or other revenue resource from which such series derives funds for repayment further information concerning the various types of bonds contained in the trust is available in

cutler pa special counsel for the trust for florida tax matters under existing law for florida state income tax purposes the trust will not be subject to the florida income tax imposed by the florida

such trust in the ratio set forth in essential information in part a of this prospectus units may only be sold in states in which they are registered to the extent that any units of any trust are redeemed by the trustee the aggregate value of the trusts assets will decrease by the amount paid to the redeeming unitholder but the fractional undivided interest of each unredeemed unit in such trust will increase proportionately the sponsor will initially and from time to time thereafter hold units in connection with their offering what are the objectives of the trusts the objectives of the trusts are income exempt from federal income tax and in the case of state trusts where applicable state income and intangibles taxes and conservation of capital through an investment in obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united states and authorities and political subdivisions thereof the interest on which is in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the

residents of that state in which bonds are issued insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in each insured trust has been obtained by the sponsor

consists of municipal bonds as set forth in risk factors in part a of this prospectus the trusts may contain or be concentrated in one or more of the types of bonds discussed below the following paragraphs briefly discuss certain circumstances which may adversely affect the ability of issuers of bonds held in the portfolio of a trust to make payments of principal and interest or the ratings of such bonds for economic risks specific to the individual trusts see risk factors in part a of this prospectus and the appendices to the information supplement of this prospectus escrow secured obligations are typically secured by direct obligations of the us government or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the us government placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent trustee until maturity or a predetermined redemption date these obligations are generally noncallable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date in a few isolated instances however bonds which were thought to be escrowed to maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity health care facility obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from services provided by hospitals or other health care facilities including nursing homes the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels of the facility demand for services wages of employees overhead expenses competition from other similar providers government regulation the cost of malpractice insurance and the degree of governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid housing obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for low to moderate income families housing obligations are generally prepayable at any time and therefore their average life will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels rental income mortgage default rates taxes operating expenses governmental regulations and the appropriation of subsidies industrial revenue obligations are industrial revenue bonds irbs including pollution control revenue bonds which are taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects debt service payment on irbs is dependent upon various factors including the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project expenses associated with the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions utility obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of several types of energy including electric and natural gas the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including the rates for electricity and natural gas the demand for electricity and natural gas the degree of competition governmental regulation overhead expenses and variable costs such as fuel transportation facility revenue obligations are obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of airports public transit systems and ports the ability of issuers to make debt service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations under these use agreements bonds that are secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the state or local level or of other governmental financial assistance the revenue of issuers of transit system obligations will be affected by variations in utilization which in turn may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the facilities which may fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms of transportation such as air rail and trucks the revenues of issuers which derive their payments from bridge road or tunnel toll revenues could be adversely affected by increases in fuel costs competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation water andor sewerage obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are payable from user fees from the sale of water andor sewerage services the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain rate increases population declines the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulties obtaining new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and nogrowth zoning ordinances university and college revenue obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems faced by such issuers include declines in the number of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers dedicatedtax supported obligations are obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a designated source which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds the various types of bonds described  below differ in structure and with respect to the rights of the bondholders to the underlying property each type of dedicatedtax supported bond has distinct risks only some of which are set forth below one type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by the incremental tax received on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical area such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or revenues another type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the project such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying property for unpaid taxes a third type of dedicatedtax supported bond may be secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture sale or consumption of commodities or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges within a taxing jurisdiction as to any of these types of bonds the ability of the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy the financial success of the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes the value of any property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely fashion each of these factors will have a different affect on each distinct type of dedicatedtax supported bonds municipal lease obligations are obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity and are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing governmental entity a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby original issue discount obligations and stripped obligations are bonds which were issued with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their face or par values in a stable interest rate environment the market value of an original issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity certain of the original issue discount obligations in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount of the bond at its maturity zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest currently original issue discount obligations including zero coupon bonds may be subject to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption the accreted value plus if applicable some premium pursuant to such call provisions an original issue discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its face value see the schedule of investments appearing in part a of this prospectus for more information about the call provisions of portfolio bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be stripped obligations which represent evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a payment of interest on a taxexempt obligation stripped obligations each stripped obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable at maturity a stripped obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds as described above unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations under applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes interest on original issue discount obligations or stripped obligations may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no corresponding cash payment composition of trusts each trust initially consists of delivery statements relating to contracts to purchase bonds or of such bonds as are listed under schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus and thereafter of such bonds as may continue to be held from time to time including certain securities deposited in the trust in substitution for bonds not delivered to a trust or in exchange or substitution for bonds upon certain refundings together with accrued and undistributed interest thereon and undistributed cash realized from the disposition of bonds whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the contracts to purchase bonds delivered to the trustee represent an obligation by issuers or dealers to deliver bonds to the sponsor for deposit in the trusts certain of the contracts relate to bonds which have not been issued as of the date of deposit and which are commonly referred to as when issued or when as and if issued bonds although the sponsor believes it unlikely if such bonds or replacement bonds described below are not acquired by a trust or if their delivery is delayed the estimated current returns and estimated long term returns shown in part a of this prospectus may be reduced certain of the contracts for the purchase of bonds provide for delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit interest on such when issued and delayed delivery bonds accrues to the benefit of unitholders commencing with the first settlement  date for the units however in the opinion of counsel unitholders who purchase their units prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee must reduce the tax basis of their units for interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of units and the delivery of the bonds because such amounts constitute a return of principal as a result of such adjustment the estimated current returns set forth in part a of this prospectus which are based on the public offering price as of the business day prior to the date of deposit may be slightly lower than that which unitholders will receive after the first year assuming the portfolio does not change and estimated annual expense does not vary from that set forth under essential information in part a of this prospectus those bonds in each trust purchased with delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit are so noted in the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus limited replacement of certain bonds neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any bond in the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for a trust under a contract including those bonds purchased on a when as and if issued basis failed bonds the sponsor is authorized under the indenture to direct the trustee to acquire other specified bonds replacement bonds to make up the original corpus of the trust within  days after delivery of notice of the failed contract and the cost to the trust exclusive of accrued interest may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed bonds the replacement bonds must satisfy the criteria previously described for the trusts and shall be substantially identical to the failed bonds they replace in terms of i the exemption from federal and state taxation ii maturity and iii cost to the trust in addition replacement bonds shall not be when as and if issued bonds whenever a replacement bond has been acquired for a trust the trustee shall within five days after the delivery thereof mail or deliver a notice of such acquisition to all unitholders of the trust involved once the original corpus of the trust is acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investment of the trust to the extent replacement bonds are not acquired the sponsor shall refund to all unitholders of the trust involved the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds not replaced and the principal and accrued interest attributable to such bonds shall be distributed not more than  days after the determination of such failure or at such earlier time as the trustee in its sole discretion deems to be in the interest of the unitholders any such accrued interest paid to unitholders will be paid by the sponsor and accordingly will not be treated as taxexempt income in the event failed bonds in a trust could not be replaced the net annual interest income per unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return thereon might be lowered sale maturity and redemption of bonds certain of the bonds may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms the proceeds from such events will be used to pay for units redeemed or distributed to unitholders and not reinvested accordingly no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition all of the bonds in each trust are subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions described in the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus and in most cases pursuant to a sinking fund or special or extraordinary redemption provisions see the discussion of the various types of bond issues above for information on the call provisions of such bonds particularly single family mortgage revenue bonds certain bonds may carry a mandatory put also referred to as a mandatory tender or mandatory repurchase feature pursuant to which the holder of such bonds will receive payment of the full principal amount thereof on a stated date prior to the maturity date unless such holder affirmatively acts to retain the bond the trustee does not have the authority to act to retain bonds with such features accordingly it will receive payment of the full principal amount of any such bonds on the stated put date and such date is therefore treated as the maturity date of such bonds in selecting bonds for the respective trusts and for purposes of calculating the average maturity of the bonds in any trust the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the trust involved the exercise of redemption or call provisions is more likely to occur in situations where the bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par as opposed to a discount from par in the case of original issue discount bonds such redemption is generally to be made at the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to the date of redemption such price is referred to herein as accreted value because bonds may have been valued at prices above or below par value or the then current accreted value at the time units were purchased unitholders may realize gain or loss upon the redemption of portfolio bonds see what is the tax status of unitholders and when are distributions made to unitholders in part b and the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus certain tax matters litigation certain of the bonds in a trusts portfolio may be subject to continuing requirements regarding the actual use of bond proceeds the manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds or the rebate of excess earnings on bond proceeds any of which may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal  income taxation although at the time of issuance of each of the bonds in each trust an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations from federal income taxation and the issuers covenanted to comply with all requirements necessary to retain the taxexempt status of the bonds there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements established upon issuance of the bonds a failure to comply with such requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to federal income taxation perhaps even retroactively from the date of issuance of such bonds thereby reducing the value of the bonds and subjecting unitholders to unanticipated tax liabilities to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any of the trusts it is possible that after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated with respect to bonds in any trust any such litigation may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxexempt nature of the interest thereon but while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted the opinions of bond counsel to the issuer of each bond on the date of issuance state that such bonds were validly issued and that the interest thereon is to the extent indicated exempt from federal income tax why and how are the bonds insured insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in each insured trust has been obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds from the mbia insurance corporation the insurer certain of the bonds in an insured trust may

such unitholders letter of intent further through the establishment of the letter of intent such unitholder agrees that units representing  of the total amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the trustee pending completion of these purchases all distributions on units held in escrow will be credited to such unitholders account if total purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a unitholders letter of intent the units held in escrow will be transferred to such unitholders account a unitholder who purchases units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of units specified in a unitholders letter of intent the amount of which would cause the unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge reduction will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the purchase of units which caused the unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of units during the letter of intent period if the total purchases are less than the amount specified the unitholder involved must pay the sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied the unitholder will however be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level if such unitholder does not pay the additional amount within  days after written request by the sponsor or the unitholders securities representative the sponsor will instruct the trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed units to meet the required payment by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder irrevocably appoints the sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of such unitholders escrowed units with full power of substitution in the premises a unitholder or his securities representative must notify the sponsor whenever such unitholder makes a purchase of units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended amount sales charges during the primary offering period are as follows national and state

charge included in the public offering price of any particular trust will depend on the maturities of the bonds in the portfolio of such trust pursuant to the terms of the indenture the trustee may terminate a trust if the net asset value of such trust as shown by any evaluation is less than  of the original principal amount of the trust at all times while units are being offered for sale the sponsor will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying bonds in each trust as of  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the new york stock exchange the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time and will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such appraisal such public offering price will be effective for all orders received by a dealer or the sponsor at or prior to  pm eastern time on each such day or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time orders received after that time or on a day when the exchange is closed for a scheduled holiday or weekend will be held until the next determination of price accrued interest from the preceding record date to but not including the settlement date of the transaction three business days after purchase will be added to the public offering price to determine the purchase price of units see what is accrued interest the graduated sales charges set forth above will apply on all applicable purchases of nuveen investment company securities on any one day by the same purchaser in the amounts stated and for this purpose purchases of this series will be aggregated with concurrent purchases of any other series or of shares of any openend management investment company of which the sponsor is principal underwriter and with respect to the purchase of which a sales charge is imposed purchases by or for the account of individuals and their spouses parents

collectively the discounted purchases in addition such investors may purchase units in the secondary market at the  public offering price for nonbreakpoint purchases minus the concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers for nonbreakpoint purchases notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this prospectus investors who purchase units as described in this paragraph will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases the initial or primary public offering price of the units in each trust is based upon a pro rata share of the offering prices per unit of the bonds in such trust plus the applicable sales charge the secondary market public offering price of each trust is based upon a pro rata share of the bid prices per unit of the bonds in such trust plus the applicable sales charge the offering prices of bonds in a trust may be expected to average between  to  more than the bid prices of such bonds the difference between the bid side evaluation and the offering side evaluation of the bonds in each trust on the business day prior to the date of deposit is shown in the discussion of each trust portfolio whether or not units are being offered for sale the sponsor will determine the aggregate value of each trust as of  pm eastern time i on each june  or december  or if such date is not a business day the last business day prior thereto ii on any day on which a unit is tendered for redemption or the next succeeding business day if the date of tender is a nonbusiness day and iii at such other times as may be necessary for this purpose a business day shall be any day on which the exchange is normally open see unit value and evaluation market for units during the initial public offering period the sponsor intends to offer to purchase units of each trust at a price equivalent to the pro rata share per unit of the offering prices of the bonds in such trust plus accrued interest afterward although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for units of each trust at its own expense and continuously to offer to purchase units of each trust at prices subject to change at any time which are based upon the bid prices of bonds in the respective portfolios of the trusts unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of the trustee or their broker as to the current redemption price see how units may be redeemed without charge in connection with its secondary marketmaking activities the sponsor may from time to time enter into secondary market joint account agreements with other brokers and dealers pursuant to such an agreement the sponsor will purchase units from the broker or dealer at the bid price and will place the units into a joint account managed by the sponsor sales from the account will be made in accordance with the then current prospectus and the sponsor and the broker or dealer will share profits and losses in the joint account in accordance with the terms of their joint account agreement certificates if any for units are delivered to the purchaser as promptly after the date of settlement three business days after purchase as the trustee can complete the mechanics of registration normally within  hours after registration instructions are received purchasers of units to whom certificates are issued will be unable to exercise any right of redemption until they have received their certificates properly endorsed for transfer see how units may be redeemed without charge what is accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds in each trust is accounted for daily on an accrual basis for this reason the purchase price of units of a trust will include not only the public offering price but also the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement accrued interest does not include accrual of original issue discount on zero coupon bonds stripped obligations or other original issue discount bonds interest accrues to the benefit of unitholders commencing with the settlement date of their purchase transaction in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest that investors would have to pay in addition to the public offering price the trustee has agreed to advance to each trust the amount of accrued interest due on the bonds as of the date of deposit which has been designated the first record date for all plans of distribution this accrued interest will be paid to the sponsor as the holder of record of all units on the date of deposit consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the date of deposit to but not including the date of settlement of the investors purchase three business days after purchase less any distributions from the related interest account the trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other cost to the trusts from interest received on the bonds deposited in each trust the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trusts since municipal bond interest is accrued daily but paid only semiannually during the initial months of the trusts the interest accounts consisting of accrued but uncollected interest and collected interest cash will be predominantly the uncollected accrued interest that is not available for distribution however due to advances by the trustee the trustee will provide a first distribution between approximately  and  days after the date of deposit assuming each trust retains its original size and composition and expenses and fees remain the same annual interest collected and distributed will approximate the estimated net annual interest income stated herein however the amount of accrued interest at any point in time  will be greater than the amount that the trustee will have actually received and distributed to the unitholders therefore there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is included in the purchase price and the redemption price of the units interest is accounted for daily and a proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest computed from the preceding record date is added to the daily valuation of each unit of each trust see part a of this prospectus and when are distributions made to unitholders as bonds mature or are redeemed or sold the accrued interest applicable to such bonds is collected and subsequently distributed to unitholders unitholders who sell or redeem all or a portion of their units will be paid their proportionate share of the remaining accrued interest to but not including the third business day following the date of sale or tender what are estimated long term return and estimated current return the estimated long term return for each trust is a measure of the return to the investor expected to be earned over the estimated life of the trust the estimated long term return represents an average of the yields to maturity or call of the bonds in the trusts portfolio calculated in accordance with accepted bond practice and adjusted to reflect expenses and sales charges under accepted bond practice taxexempt bonds are customarily offered to investors on a yield price basis which involves computation of yield to maturity or to an earlier call date whichever produces the lower yield and which takes into account not only the interest payable on the bonds but also the amortization or accretion of any premium over or discount from the par maturity value inherent in the bonds purchase price in the calculation of estimated long term return the average yield for a trusts portfolio is derived by weighting each bonds yield by the market value of the bond and by the amount of time remaining to the date to which the bond is priced this weighted average yield is then adjusted to reflect estimated expenses is compounded and is reduced by a factor which represents the amortization of the sales charge over the expected average life of a trust the estimated long term return calculation does not take into account the effect of a first distribution which may be less than a regular distribution or may be paid at some point after  days or a second distribution which may be less than a normal distribution for unitholders who choose quarterly or semiannual plans of distribution and it also does not take into account the difference in timing of payments to unitholders who choose quarterly or semiannual plans of distribution each of which will reduce the return estimated current return is computed by dividing the net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price in contrast to estimated long term return estimated current return does not reflect the amortization of premium or accretion of discount if any on the bonds in a trusts portfolio net annual interest income per unit is calculated by dividing the annual interest income to a trust less estimated expenses by the number of units outstanding net annual interest income per unit used to calculate estimated current return will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trustee and the evaluator and with the redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds a unitholders actual return may vary significantly from the estimated longterm return based on their holding period market interest rate changes other factors affecting the prices of individual bonds in the portfolio and differences between the expected remaining life of portfolio bonds and the actual length of time that they remain in a trust such actual holding periods may be reduced by termination of a trust as described in other information since both the estimated current return and the estimated long term return quoted herein are based on the market value of the underlying bonds on the business day prior to the date of deposit subsequent calculations of these performance measures will reflect the then current market value of the underlying bonds and may be higher or lower the sponsor will provide estimated cash flow information relating to a trust without charge to each potential investor in a trust who receives this prospectus and makes an oral or written request to the sponsor for such information a portion of the monies received by a trust may be treated in the first year only as a return of principal due to the inclusion in the trust portfolio of whenissued or other bonds having delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit a consequence of this treatment is that in the computation of estimated current return for the first year such monies are excluded from net annual interest income and treated as an adjustment to the public offering price see essential information appearing in part a of this prospectus composition of trusts and what is the tax status of unitholders a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on a trust and returns over specified periods on other similar nuveen trusts with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust us government bonds for example are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and bank cds and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government money market accounts and money  market funds provide stability of principal but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the shortterm debt market the investment characteristics of the trusts are described more fully elsewhere in the prospectus how was the price of the bonds determined at the date of deposit the prices at which the bonds deposited in the trusts would have been offered to the public on the business day prior to the date of deposit were determined by the trustee on the basis of an evaluation of such bonds prepared by kenny sp evaluation services a division of j j kenny co inc kenny sp a firm regularly engaged in the business of evaluating quoting or appraising comparable bonds with respect to bonds in insured trusts and insured bonds in traditional trusts kenny sp evaluated the bonds as so insured see why and how are the bonds insured the amount by which the trustees determination of the offering prices of the bonds deposited in the trusts was greater or less than the cost of such bonds to the sponsor was profit or loss to the sponsor exclusive of any underwriting profit see part a of this prospectus the sponsor also may realize further profit or sustain further loss as a result of fluctuations in the public offering price of the units cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the settlement date for a purchase of units or prior to the acquisition of all portfolio securities by a trust may be available for use in the sponsors business and may be of benefit to the sponsor what is the tax status of unitholders at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to state trusts where applicable bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest on such bonds when held by residents of the state in which the issuers of such bonds are located from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes for a discussion of the tax status of state trusts see part a of this prospectus neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler has made any review of the trusts proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date of which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unitholder is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trusts is debt the interest on which is excluded for federal income tax purposes in the opinion of chapman and cutler counsel to the sponsor under existing law as of the date of this prospectus  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which is excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code will retain its status for federal income tax purposes when received by the trusts and when distributed to the unitholders however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax an additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental tax the superfund tax see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unitholders below  each unitholder of a trust is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of such trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when such trust disposes of a bond or when the unitholder redeems or sells units if the unitholder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all the assets of the trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the bonds represented by the unit the taxpayer relief act of  includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain eg short sales offsetting notional principal contracts futures or forward contracts or similar transactions as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not loss and for purposes of determining the holding period unitholders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sales rules unitholders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds delivered after the date the unitholders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unitholders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment at maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unitholder  subject to various nonrecognition provisions of the code the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unitholders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unitholders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unitholder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unitholder realizing a taxable gain when his or her units are sold or redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost unitholders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the calculation of basis and  any amounts paid on defaulted bonds held by the trustee under policies of insurance issued with respect to such bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bonds on the date a unitholder acquires his units and the price the unitholder pays for his units unitholders should consult with their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application the revenue reconciliation act of  the  tax act subjects taxexempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to a statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price the trust pays for the bonds or the price a unitholder pays for his or her units under the  tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while the trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unitholders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unitholder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding these rules and their application certain tax matters applicable to corporate unitholders in the case of certain corporations the alternative minimum tax and the superfund tax for taxable years beginning after december   depend upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments one of the adjustment items used in computing amti of a corporation other than an s corporation regulated investment company real estate investment trust remic or fasit is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all taxexempt interest including interest on all bonds in the trust under current code provisions the superfund tax does not apply to tax years beginning on or after january   legislative proposals have been introduced that would reinstate the superfund tax for taxable years after december   and before january   under the provisions of section  of the code a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust unitholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them including the corporate alternative minimum tax the superfund tax and the branch profits tax imposed by section  of the code counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units  however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units would generally not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of such units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain other corporations including securities dealers and other financial intermediaries investors with questions regarding this issue should consult with their tax advisers in the case of certain of the bonds in the trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes that he or she may be a substantial user or a related person as so defined should contact his or her tax adviser all statements in the prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income for federal state or other tax purposes are the opinion of counsel and are to be so construed at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler has made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for such opinions the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of  the  tax act provides that for taxpayers other than corporations net capital gain which is defined as net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year realized from property with certain exclusions is subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate of   in the case of certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less the date on which a unit is acquired ie the trade date is excluded for purposes for determining the holding period of the unit the legislation is generally effective retroactively for amounts properly taken into account on or after january   capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income in addition please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are considered conversion transactions effective for transactions entered into after april   unitholders and prospective investors should consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this provision on their investment in units for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations and the superfund tax for corporations interest on certain private activity bonds which includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds issued on or after august   is included as an item of tax preference however the assets of the trust do not include any such private activity bonds issued on or after that date in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds a base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includible in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the  tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from the trusts will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any taxexempt interest a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income after inclusion of taxexempt interest does not exceed the base amount need not include any social security benefits in gross income ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain taxpayers including without limitation corporations subject to either the environmental tax or the branch profits tax financial institutions certain  insurance companies certain s corporations individual recipients of social security or railroad retirement benefits and taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry taxexempt obligations prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences except as noted above and in part a of this prospectus the exemption of interest on state and local obligations for federal income tax purposes discussed above does not necessarily result in exemption under the income or other tax laws of any state or city the laws of the several states vary with respect to the taxation of such obligations in the opinion of carter ledyard  milburn counsel to the trustee and in the absence of a new york trust from the series special counsel for the series for new york tax matters under existing law under the income tax laws of the state and city of new york each trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and the income of each trust will be treated as the income of the unitholders for a summary of each opinion of special counsel to the respective state trusts for state tax matters see part a of this prospectus what are normal trust operating expenses no annual advisory fee is charged to the trusts by the sponsor the sponsor does however receive a fee as set forth in essential information in part a of this prospectus for regularly evaluating the bonds and for maintaining surveillance over the portfolio the sponsors evaluation fee the trustee receives for ordinary recurring services an annual fee for each plan of distribution for each trust as set forth in essential information appearing in part a of this prospectus each annual fee is per  principal amount of the underlying bonds in a trust for that portion of the trust that represents a particular plan of distribution provided however that for services performed prior to the record date for the second distribution from the interest account indicated under interest distributions in part a of the prospectus the trustees compensation shall be computed in respect of all units outstanding at the rate specified for the monthly plan of distribution the trustees compensation with respect to each trust is computed on the basis of the largest principal amount of bonds in the trust at any time during the period with respect to which such compensation is being computed the trustees fee may be periodically adjusted in response to fluctuations in shortterm interest rates reflecting the cost to the trustee of advancing funds to a trust to meet scheduled distributions in addition the sponsors evaluation fee and the trustees fee may be adjusted in accordance with the cumulative percentage increase of the united states department of labors consumer price index entitled all services less rent of shelter since the establishment of the trusts or if such index no longer exists a comparable index the trustee has the use of funds if any being held in the interest and principal accounts of each trust for future distributions payment of expenses and redemptions these accounts are noninterest bearing to unitholders pursuant to normal banking procedures the trustee benefits from the use of funds held therein part of the trustees compensation for its services to the trusts is expected to result from such use of these funds premiums for the policies of insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the bond issuers with respect to the bonds in the insured trusts and with respect to insured bonds in traditional trusts have been paid in full prior to the deposit of the bonds in the trusts and the value of such insurance has been included in the evaluation of the bonds in each trust and accordingly in the public offering price of units of each trust there are no annual continuing premiums for such insurance the trusts and therefore unitholders will bear all or a portion of their offering costs including costs of registering units with the securities and

amounts if funds are not otherwise available in the applicable interest and principal accounts  the indenture requires each trust to be audited on an annual basis at the expense of the trust by independent public accountants selected by the sponsor the trustee shall not be required however to cause such an audit to be performed if its cost to a trust shall exceed  per unit on an annual basis unitholders of a trust covered by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements upon request when are distributions made to unitholders interest received by the trustee on the bonds

first day of each month record dates for quarterly distributions will be the first day of february may august and november and record dates for semiannual distributions will be the first day of may and november see part a of this prospectus for details of distributions per unit of each trust under the various plans based upon estimated net annual interest income at the date of deposit the amount of the regular distributions will generally change when bonds are redeemed mature or are sold or when fees and expenses increase or decrease for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in the distributions from the interest account of a trust the trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide for interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee shall be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the interest account of such trust the trustees fee takes into account the costs attributable to the outlay of capital needed to make such advances the plan of distribution selected by a unitholder will remain in effect until changed unitholders purchasing units in the secondary market will initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner unitholders desiring to change their plan of distribution may do so by sending a written notice requesting the change together with any certificates to the trustee the notice and any certificates must be received by the trustee not later than the semiannual record date to be effective as of the semiannual distribution following the

as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of such trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate account in addition the trustee shall withdraw from the interest account and the principal account of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units of such trust by the trustee funds which are available for future distributions redemptions and payment of expenses are held in accounts which are noninterest bearing to unitholders and are available for use by the trustee pursuant to normal banking procedures  accumulation plan the sponsor is also the principal underwriter of several openend mutual funds the accumulation funds into which unitholders may choose to reinvest trust distributions unitholders may elect to reinvest principal distributions or interest and principal distributions automatically without any sales charge each accumulation fund has investment objectives which differ in certain respects from those of the trusts and may invest in securities which would not be eligible for deposit in the trusts further information concerning the accumulation plan and a list of accumulation funds is set forth in the information supplement of this prospectus which may be obtained by contacting the trustee at the phone number listed on the back cover of this prospectus participants may at any time by so notifying the trustee in writing elect to change the accumulation fund into which their distributions are being reinvested to change from principal only reinvestment to reinvestment of both principal and interest or vice versa or to terminate their participation in the accumulation plan altogether and receive future distributions on their units in cash there will be no charge or other penalty for such change of election or termination the character of trust distributions for income tax purposes will remain unchanged even if they are reinvested in an accumulation fund how detailed are reports to unitholders the trustee shall furnish unitholders of a trust in connection with each distribution a statement of the amount of interest if any and the amount of other receipts received since the preceding distribution being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit of a trust outstanding and a year to date summary of all distributions paid on said units within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a registered unitholder of a trust a statement with respect to such trust i as to the interest account interest received including amounts representing interest received upon any disposition of bonds and except for any state trust the percentage of such interest by states in which the issuers of the bonds are located deductions for fees and expenses of such trust redemption of units and the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year ii as to the principal account the dates of disposition of any bonds and the net proceeds received therefrom excluding any portion representing accrued interest the amount paid for purchase of replacement bonds the amount paid upon redemption of units deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and expenses of the trustee and the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed both as a total dollar amount and

business day of such calendar year iv the unit value based upon the last computation thereof made during such calendar year and v amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from the interest account and from the principal account separately stated expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding each annual statement will reflect pertinent information in respect of all plans of distribution so that unitholders may be informed regarding the results of other plans of distribution unit value and evaluation the value of each trust is determined by the sponsor on the basis of  the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being collected  the value of the bonds in the trust based on the bid prices of the bonds and  interest accrued thereon not subject to collection less  amounts representing taxes or governmental charges payable out of the trust and  the accrued expenses of the trust the result of such computation is divided by the number of units of such trust outstanding as of the date thereof to determine the per unit value unit value of such trust the sponsor may determine the value of the bonds in each trust  on the basis of current bid prices of the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by a trust  if bid prices are not available for any of the bonds on the basis of bid prices for comparable bonds  by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluating quoting or appraising comparable bonds or  by any combination of the above although the unit value of each trust is based on the bid prices of the bonds the units are sold initially to the public at the public offering price based on the offering prices of the bonds because the insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers of bonds with respect to the bonds in the insured trusts and with respect to insured bonds in traditional trusts is effective so long as such bonds are outstanding such insurance will be taken into account in determining the bid and offering prices of such bonds and therefore some value attributable to such insurance will be included in the value of units of trusts that include such bonds  how units of the trusts are distributed to the public nuveen in addition to being the sponsor is the sole underwriter of the units it is the intention of the sponsor to qualify units of national long intermediate intermediate short intermediate and short term trusts for sale under the laws of substantially all of the states of the united states of america and units of state trusts only in the state for which the trust is named and selected other states promptly following the deposit of bonds in exchange for units of the trusts it is the practice of the sponsor to place all of the units as collateral for a letter or letters of credit from one or more commercial banks under an agreement to release such units from time to time as needed for distribution under such an arrangement the sponsor pays such banks compensation based on the then current interest rate this is a normal warehousing arrangement during the period of distribution of the units to public investors to facilitate the handling of transactions sales of units shall be limited to transactions involving a minimum of either  or  units whichever is less the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units the sponsor plans to allow a discount to brokers and dealers in connection with the primary distribution of units and also in secondary market transactions the primary market discounts are as follows discount per unit  national long inter short inter

units of each trust see market for units the amount of the dealer concession on secondary market purchases of trust units through the sponsor will be computed based upon the value of the bonds in the trust portfolio including the sales charge computed as described in how is the public offering price determined and adjusted to reflect the cash position of the trust principal account and will vary

be earned as a marketing allowance by dealer firms who reach cumulative firm sales or sales arrangement levels of a specified number of units of an individual trust during the primary offering period as set forth in the table below for firms that meet the necessary volume level for a trust volume incentives may be given on all trades involving that trust originated from or by that firm during the primary offering period  primary market volume incentives per trust sales level average maturity during the primary volume incentive of trust offering period per unit    less than  years at least

secondary market sales of at least  million of nuveen unit trust units per calendar quarter only sales through the sponsor qualify for volume incentives and for meeting minimum requirements the sponsor reserves the right to modify or change the volume incentive schedule at any time and make the determination as to which firms qualify for the marketing allowance and the amount paid registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge is imposed and bank trust departments investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment authority and that are held in a fiduciary agency custodial or similar capacity are not entitled to receive any dealer concession for any sales made to investors which qualified as discounted purchases during the primary or secondary market see how is the public offering price determined certain commercial banks are making units of the trusts available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted to the banks in the amounts shown in the above table the glasssteagall act prohibits banks from underwriting trust units the act does however permit certain agency transactions and banking regulators have not indicated that these particular agency transactions are not permitted under the act in texas and in certain other states any bank making units available must be registered as a broker dealer under state law ownership and transfer of units the ownership of units is evidenced in certificated form unless the unitholder expressly requests that the purchased units be evidenced by book entry positions recorded on the books and records of the trustee the trustee is authorized to treat as the owner of units that person who at the time is registered as such on the books of the trustee any unitholder who holds a certificate may change to book entry ownership by submitting to the trustee the certificate along with a written request that the units represented by such certificate be held in book entry form likewise a unitholder who holds units in book entry form may obtain a certificate for such units by written request to the trustee units may be held in denominations of one unit or any multiple or fraction thereof fractions of units are computed to three decimal places any certificates issued will be numbered serially for identification and are issued in fully registered form transferable only on the books of the trustee book entry unitholders will receive a book entry position confirmation reflecting their ownership for trusts allowing optional plans of distribution certificates for units will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating which plan of distribution has been selected when a change is made the existing certificates must be surrendered to the trustee and new certificates issued to reflect the currently effective plan of distribution there will be no charge for this service holders of book entry units can change their plan of distribution by making a written request to the trustee which will issue a new book entry position confirmation to reflect such change units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and in the case of units evidenced by certificates by presenting and surrendering such certificates to the trustee at its address listed on the back cover of this part b of the prospectus properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer the certificates should be sent registered or certified mail for the protection of the unitholder each unitholder must sign such written request and such certificates or transfer instrument exactly as his name appears on a the face of the certificates representing the units to be transferred or b the book entry position confirmations relating to the units to be transferred such signatures must be guaranteed by a guarantor acceptable to the trustee in certain instances the trustee may require additional documents such as but not limited to trust instruments certificates of death appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of corporate authority mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the trustee in order for a replacement certificate to be issued although at the date hereof no charge is made and none is contemplated a unitholder may be required to pay  to the trustee for each certificate reissued or transfer of units requested and to pay any governmental charge which may be imposed in connection therewith  replacement of lost stolen or destroyed certificates to obtain a new certificate replacing one that has been lost stolen or destroyed the unitholder must furnish the trustee with sufficient indemnification and pay such expenses as the trustee may incur this indemnification must be in the form of an open penalty bond of indemnification the premium for such an indemnity bond may vary but currently amounts to  of the market value of the units represented by the certificate in the case however of a trust as to which notice of termination has been given the premium currently amounts to  of the market value of the units represented by such certificate how units may be redeemed without charge unitholders may redeem all or a portion of their units by  making a written request for such redemption book entry unitholders may use the redemption form on the reverse side of their book entry position confirmation to the trustee at its address listed on the back cover of this part b of the prospectus redemptions of  units or more will require a signature guarantee  in the case of units evidenced by a certificate by also tendering such certificate to the trustee duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signatures guaranteed as explained above or provide satisfactory indemnity required in connection with lost stolen or destroyed certificates and  payment of applicable governmental charges if any certificates should be sent only by registered or certified mail to minimize the possibility of their being lost or stolen see ownership and transfer of units no redemption fee will be charged a unitholder may authorize the trustee to honor telephone instructions for the redemption of units held in book entry form units represented by certificates may not be redeemed by telephone the proceeds of units redeemed by telephone will be sent by check either to the unitholder at the address specified on his account or to a financial institution specified by the unitholder for credit to the account of the unitholder a unitholder wishing to use this method of redemption must complete a telephone redemption authorization form and furnish the form to the trustee telephone redemption authorization forms can be obtained from a unitholders registered representative or by calling the trustee once the completed form is on file the trustee will honor telephone redemption requests by any authorized person the time a telephone redemption request is received determines the date of tender as discussed below the redemption proceeds will be mailed within three business days following the telephone redemption request only units held in the name of individuals may be redeemed by telephone accounts registered in broker name or accounts of corporations or fiduciaries including among others trustees guardians executors and administrators may not use the telephone redemption privilege on the third business day following the date of tender the unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash for each unit tendered an amount equal to the unit value of such trust determined by the trustee as of  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time on the date of tender as defined hereafter plus accrued interest to but not including the third business day after the date of tender redemption price the price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the bonds on the date of tender unitholders should check with the trustee or their broker to determine the redemption price before tendering units the date of tender is deemed to be the date on which the request for redemption of units is received in proper form by the trustee except that as regards a redemption request received after  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time or on any day on which the exchange is normally closed the date of tender is the next day on which such exchange is normally open for trading and such request will be deemed to have been made on such day and the redemption will be effected at the redemption price computed on that day accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account of the appropriate trust or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account of such trust all other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the principal account the trustee is empowered to sell underlying bonds of a trust in order to make funds available for redemption see how bonds may be removed from the trusts units so redeemed shall be cancelled to the extent that bonds are sold from a trust the size and diversity of such trust will be reduced such sales may be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the redemption price is determined on the basis of the bid prices of the bonds in each trust while the initial public offering price of units will be determined on the basis of the offering prices of the bonds as of  pm eastern time on any day on which the exchange is normally open for trading or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time and such determination is made as of any given time the difference between the bid and offering prices of such bonds may be expected to average  to  of principal amount in the case of actively traded bonds the difference may be as little as  to  of  and in the case of inactively traded bonds such difference usually will not exceed   the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period during which the securities and exchange commission determines that trading in the municipal bond market is restricted or an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable or for such other periods as the securities and exchange commission may by order permit under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee will be required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing his or her tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker at the time the certificate or book entry return confirmation is issued and this number is printed on the certificate or book entry return confirmation and on distribution statements if a unitholders tax identification number does not appear as described above or if it is incorrect the unitholder should contact the trustee before redeeming units to determine what action if any is required to avoid this backup withholding how units may be purchased by the sponsor the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price it may purchase such units by notifying the trustee before the close of business on the second succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the unitholder not later than the day on which payment would otherwise have been made by the trustee see how units may be redeemed without charge the sponsors current practice is to bid at the redemption price in the secondary market units held by the sponsor may be tendered to the trustee for redemption as any other units how bonds may be removed from the trusts bonds will be removed from a trust as they mature or are redeemed by the issuers thereof see risk factors in part a of this prospectus and summary of portfolios

expenses for which income may not be available under the indenture the sponsor is obligated to provide the trustee with a current list of bonds in each trust to be sold in such circumstances in

of the sale of various bonds  the effect on principal amount of underlying bonds per unit of the sale of various bonds  the financial condition of the issuers and  the effect of the sale of various bonds on the investment character of the trust such sales if required could result in the sale of bonds by the trustee at prices less than original cost to the trust to the extent bonds are sold the size and diversity of such trust will be reduced in addition the sponsor is empowered to direct the trustee to liquidate bonds upon the happening of certain other events such as default in the payment of principal andor interest an action of the issuer that will adversely affect its ability to continue payment of the principal of and interest on its bonds or an adverse change in market revenue or credit factors affecting the investment character of the bonds if a default in the payment of the principal of andor interest on any of the bonds occurs and if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee whether to sell or continue to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the indenture provides that the trustee shall liquidate said bonds forthwith and shall not be liable for any loss so incurred the sponsor may also direct the trustee to liquidate bonds in a trust if the bonds in the trust are the subject of an advanced refunding

changes in interest rates generally early call provisions and the potential for changes in the tax status of the bonds as set forth in the portfolio summaries in part a of this prospectus the trusts may contain or be concentrated in one or more of the types of bonds discussed below the following paragraphs discuss certain circumstances which may adversely affect the ability of issuers of bonds held in the portfolio of a trust to make payment of principal and interest thereon or which may adversely affect the ratings of such bonds with respect to insured trusts however because of the insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers of the bonds such changes should not adversely affect an insured trusts receipt of principal and interest the standard  poors aaa or moodys aaa ratings of the bonds in the insured trust portfolio or the standard  poors aaa rating of the units of each such insured trust for economic risks specific to the individual trusts see risk factors for each trust health care facility revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from services provided by hospitals or other health care facilities including nursing homes ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are sometimes based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required an increasing shortage of qualified nurses or a dramatic rise in nursing salaries physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities economic developments in the service area competition from other similar providers efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a prospective basis and are not based on a providers actual costs such method of reimbursement may adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for services provided under the medicare program and thereby may have an adverse effect on the ability of such institutions to satisfy debt service requirements in the event of a default upon a bond secured by hospital facilities the limited alternative uses for such facilities may result in the recovery upon such collateral not providing sufficient funds to fully repay the bonds certain hospital bonds provide for redemption at par upon the damage destruction or condemnation of the hospital facilities or in other special circumstances single family and multifamily housing revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans to housing projects for the elderly or for low to moderate income families such issues are generally characterized by mandatory redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value in the event of economic defaults and in the event of a failure of the operator of a project to comply with certain covenants as to the operation of the project the failure of such operator to comply with certain covenants related to the taxexempt status of interest on the bonds such as provisions requiring that a specified percentage of units be rented or available for rental to low or moderate income families potentially could cause interest on such bonds to be subject to federal income taxation from the date of issuance of the bonds the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects including among other things the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and adequate rental income employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets increases in taxes utility costs and other operating expenses the managerial ability of project managers changes in laws and governmental regulations the appropriation of subsidies and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the projects are located occupancy of such housing projects may be adversely affected by high rent levels and income limitations imposed under federal and state programs single family mortgage revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be single family mortgage revenue bonds which are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period the redemption price of such issues may be more or less than the offering price of such bonds additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue  bonds single family mortgage revenue bonds issued after december   were issued under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended or section  of the internal revenue code of  which sections contain certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that such continuing requirements will be satisfied the failure to meet such requirements could cause interest on the bonds to be subject to federal income taxation possibly from the date of issuance of the bonds congregate care revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from loans to finance the construction andor acquisition of congregate care facilities including retirement facilities and nursing care units a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required management capabilities an increasing shortage of qualified nurses or a dramatic rise in nursing salaries economic developments in the service area competition from other similar providers efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance federally enhanced obligations some of the mortgages which secure the various health care or housing projects which underlie the previously discussed health care facility revenue single family and multifamily housing revenue single family mortgage revenue obligations and congregate care revenue bonds the obligations in a trust may be insured by the federal housing administration fha under fha regulations the maximum insurable mortgage amount cannot exceed  of the fhas estimated value of the project the fha mortgage insurance does not constitute a guarantee of timely payment of the principal of and interest on the obligations payment of mortgage insurance benefits may be  less than the principal amount of obligations outstanding or  delayed if disputes arise as to the amount of the payment or if certain notices are not given to the fha within the prescribed time periods in addition some of the previously discussed obligations may be secured by mortgagebacked certificates guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma a wholly owned corporate instrumentality of the united states andor the federal national mortgage association fannie mae a federally chartered and stockholderowed corporation gnma and fannie mae guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgagebacked certificates even where the underlying mortgage payments are not made while such mortgagebacked certificates are often pledged to secure payment of principal and interest on the obligations timely payment of interest and principal on the obligations is not insured or guaranteed by the united states gnma fannie mae or any other governmental agency or instrumentality the gnma mortgagebacked certificates constitute a general obligation of the united states backed by its full faith and credit the obligations of fannie mae including its obligations under the fannie mae mortgagebacked securities are obligations solely of fannie mae and are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the united states public housing authority revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from loans to finance public housing projects these bonds are guaranteed by the federal department of housing and urban development such issues are generally characterized by mandatory redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value in the event of economic defaults the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects including among other things the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets increases in taxes utility costs and other operating expenses changes in laws and governmental regulations and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the projects are located in addition the federal department of housing and urban development may impose regulations andor limitations which may have an adverse impact on the bonds in a trust industrial revenue obligations certain of the bonds in a trust may be industrial revenue bonds irbs which are taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities issuers are obligated only to pay amounts due on the irbs to the extent that funds are available from the unexpended proceeds of the irbs or receipts or revenues of the issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate operator of a project the arrangement may be in the form of a lease installment sale agreement conditional sale agreement or loan agreement but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may  result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may have an impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected the irbs in a trust may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may provide for redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of irbs in a trust prior to the stated maturity of such bonds power revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from pollution control bonds as well as the sale of electric energy and oil and gas some of these obligations are backed by the credit of an investor owned utility iou the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the applicable public utility commissions the difficulty of financing large construction programs increased competition reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a trust to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds utility obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of natural gas or the combined net revenue of two or more municipal utility systems operating as a single entity the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the applicable public utility commissions the difficulty of financing large construction programs increased competition reductions in estimates of future demands for natural gas in certain areas of the country the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a trust to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds transportation bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of airports public transit systems and ports the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for airport use occupancy of certain terminal space service fees and leases airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements the air transport industry is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines are experiencing severe financial difficulties in particular facilities with use agreements involving airlines experiencing financial difficulty may experience a reduction in revenue due to the possible inability of these airlines to meet their use agreement obligations because of such financial difficulties and possible bankruptcy the sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport facility bonds that are secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the state or local level or of other governmental financial assistance transit system net revenues will be affected by variations in utilization which in turn may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization demographic and population shifts and competition from other forms of transportation and by increased costs including costs resulting from previous deferrals of maintenance port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the facilities the rate of utilization of such facilities may fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms of transportation such as air rail and trucks water andor sewerage revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees  resource recovery revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of sewerage or solid waste disposal services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees education revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems of such issuers include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees bridge and tollroad revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which derive their payments from bridge road or tunnel toll revenues the revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected by competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation such revenues could also be adversely affected by a reduction in the availability of fuel to motorists or significant increases in the costs thereof specifically governmental regulations restricting the use of vehicles in the new york city metropolitan area may adversely affect revenues of the triborough bridge and tunnel authority dedicatedtax supported revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a designated source which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds the various types of bonds described below differ in structure and with respect to the rights of the bondholders to the underlying property each type of dedicatedtax supported bond has distinct risks only some of which are set forth below one type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by the incremental tax received on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical area such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or revenues another type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the project such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying property for unpaid taxes a third type of dedicatedtax supported bond may be secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture sale or consumption of commodities or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges within a taxing jurisdiction as to any of these types of bonds the ability of the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy the financial success of the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes the value of any property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely fashion each of these factors will have a different affect on each distinct type of dedicatedtax supported bonds municipal lease revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity such payments are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing governmental entity a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby special obligation to crossover some of the bonds in a trust may be issued with the intention of crossover refunding an outstanding issue at a future date these bonds are secured to the crossover date by us government securities purchased with the proceeds of the refunding bonds the revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected by problems associated with the outstanding issue economic social and environmental policies and conditions that are not within the control of the issuer and governmental policies and regulations affecting the issuer civic organization obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the pledge of civic organizations including their assets the problems faced by such issuers include the ability to collect pledges made the unpredictable nature of an organizations composition and participation the quality and skill of management increased costs and delays attributable to organizations expenses and legislation regarding certain organizational purposes original issue discount bonds and stripped obligations certain of the bonds in a trust may be original issue discount bonds these bonds were issued with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their face or par values this original issue discount the difference between the initial purchase price and face value is deemed under current law to accrue on a  daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxexempt interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption gain if any realized in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain see what is the tax status of unitholders the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its face amount at maturity in a stable interest rate environment the market value of an original issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity certain of the original issue discount bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount of the bond at its maturity the effect of owning a zero coupon bond is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of the obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield but at the same time also eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest currently original issue discount bonds including zero coupon bonds may be subject to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption the accreted value plus if applicable some premium pursuant to such call provisions an original issue discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its face value see the schedules of investments for more information about the call provisions of portfolio bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be stripped obligations which represent evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a payment of interest on a taxexempt obligation an obligation is stripped by depositing it with a custodian which then effects a separation in ownership between the bond and any interest payment which has not yet become payable and issues evidences of ownership with respect to such constituent parts a stripped obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds as described above each stripped obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable at maturity with respect to each unitholder the internal revenue code treats as original issue discount that portion of the discount which produces a yield to maturity as of the date of purchase of the unitholders units equal to the lower of the coupon rate of interest on the underlying obligation or the yield to maturity on the basis of the purchase price of the unitholders units which is allocable to each stripped obligation original issue discount which accrues with respect to a stripped obligation will be exempt from federal income taxation to the same extent as interest on the underlying obligations see what is the tax status of unitholders in part b of this prospectus unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations under applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes interest on original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no corresponding cash payment why and how are the bonds insured insurance on bonds insured truststhe insurers policy unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and complete payment required to be made by or on behalf of the issuer to the paying agent or its successor of an amount equal to i the principal of either at the stated maturity or by an advancement of maturity pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund payment and interest on the bonds as such payments shall become due but shall not be so paid except that in the event of any acceleration of the due date of such principal by reason of mandatory or optional redemption or acceleration resulting from default or otherwise other than any advancement of maturity pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund payment the payments guaranteed by the insurers policy shall be made in such amounts and at such times as such payments of principal would have been due had there not been any such acceleration and ii the reimbursement of any such payment which is subsequently recovered from any owner of the bonds pursuant to a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such payment constitutes an avoidable preference to such owner within the meaning of any applicable bankruptcy law a preference the insurers policy does not insure against loss of any prepayment premium which may at any time be payable with respect to any bond the insurers policy does not under any circumstance insure against loss relating to i optional or mandatory redemptions other than mandatory sinking fund redemptions ii any payments to be made on an accelerated basis iii payments of the purchase price of bonds upon tender by an owner thereof or iv any preference relating to i through iii above the insurers policy also does not insure against nonpayment of principal of or interest on the bonds resulting from the insolvency negligence or any other act or omission of the paying agent or any other paying agent for the bonds  upon receipt of telephonic or telegraphic notice such notice subsequently confirmed in writing by registered or certified mail or upon receipt of written notice by registered or certified mail by the insurer from the paying agent or any owner of a bond the payment of an insured amount for which is then due that such required payment has not been made the insurer on the due date of such payment or within one business day after receipt of notice of such nonpayment whichever is later will make a deposit of funds in an account with state street bank and trust company na in new york new york or its successor sufficient for the payment of any such insured amounts which are then due upon presentment and surrender of

with respect to a specific debt obligation this assessment may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other circumstances the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of defaultcapacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aabonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate

capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in the higher rated categories plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings the letter p indicates that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion accordingly the investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk note ratings a standard  poors note rating reflects the liquidity concerns and

rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an

position of such issues their safety is so absolute that as published by the rating companies  with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances characteristically their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities their market value is virtually immune to all but money market influences with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future the market value of arated bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained period of depressed business conditions but during periods of normalcy arated bonds frequently move in parallel with aaa and aa obligations with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances moodys bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic rating classification the modifier

category baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well the market value of baarated bonds is more sensitive to changes in economic circumstances and aside from occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class baa market valuations move in parallel with aaa aa and a obligations during periods of economic normalcy except in instances of oversupply con bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operation

assurances with respect to whether the market value or marketability of any of the arizona obligations issued by an entity other than the state of arizona will be affected by financial or other conditions of the state or of any entity located within the state in addition it should be noted that the state of arizona as well as counties municipalities political subdivisions and other public authorities of the state are subject to limitations imposed by arizonas constitution with respect to ad valorem taxation bonded indebtedness and other matters for example the state legislature cannot appropriate revenues in excess of  of the total personal income of the state in any fiscal year these limitations may affect the ability of the issuers to generate revenues to satisfy their debt obligations although most of the bonds in an arizona trust are revenue obligations of local governments or authorities in the state there can be no assurance that the fiscal and economic conditions referred to above will not affect the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective obligors to pay principal of and interest on the bonds when due arizona taxable

the state constitution requires that expenditures for any fiscal year not exceed revenues for such fiscal year by statute the amount of general fund revenues available for appropriation is based upon revenue estimates which together with other available resources must exceed annual appropriations by the amount of the unappropriated reserve the unappropriated reserve the unappropriated reserve requirement for fiscal years   and  was set at  of total appropriations from the general fund for fiscal years  and thereafter the unappropriated reserve requirement is  of total appropriations from the general fund in addition to the unappropriated reserve a constitutional amendment approved by colorado voters in  requires the state and each local government to reserve a certain percentage of its fiscal year spending excluding bonded debt service for emergency use the emergency reserve the minimum emergency reserve was set at  for  and  for  and is set at  for  and later years the balance held in the state controlled maintenance trust fund is now used to satisfy the emergency reserve requirement for fiscal year  and thereafter general fund appropriations are also limited by statute to an amount equal to the cost of performing certain required reappraisals of taxable property plus an amount equal to the lesser of i five percent of colorado personal income or ii  of the total general fund appropriations for the previous fiscal year this restriction does not apply to any general fund appropriations which are required as a result of a new federal law a final state or federal court order or moneys derived from the increase in the rate or amount of any tax or fee approved by a majority of the registered electors of the state voting at any general election in addition the statutory limit on the level of general fund appropriations may be exceeded for a given fiscal year upon the declaration of a state fiscal emergency by the state general assembly according to the colorado economic perspective state revenue and economic projections through fy  dated june   the  economic report which is published by the office of state planning and budgeting the fiscal year  ending general fund reserve will be  million which is  million over the unappropriated reserve requirement the  fiscal year ending general fund reserve was  million or  million over the required unappropriated reserve based on the  economic report estimates the fiscal year  ending general fund reserve is forecast to be approximately  million or  million over the required unappropriated reserve on november   voters in colorado approved a constitutional amendment the amendment which in general became effective december   and restricts the ability of the state and local governments to increase revenues and impose taxes the amendment applies to the state and all local governments including home rule entities districts enterprises defined as governmentowned businesses authorized to issue revenue bonds and receiving under  of annual revenue in grants from all colorado state and local governments combined are excluded from the provisions of the amendment the provisions of the amendment are unclear and have required judicial interpretation among other provisions beginning november   the amendment requires voter approval prior to tax increases the imposition of a new tax creation of debt or mill levy or valuation for assessment ratio increases or a change of tax policy resulting in a net revenue gain the amendment also limits increases in government spending and property tax revenues to specified percentages the amendment requires that district property tax revenues yield no more than the prior years revenues adjusted for inflation voter approved changes and except with regard to school districts local growth in property values according to a formula set forth in the amendment school districts are allowed to adjust tax levies for changes in student enrollment pursuant to the amendment local government spending is to be limited by the same formula as the limitation for property tax revenues the amendment limits increases in expenditures from the state general fund and program revenues cash funds to the growth in inflation plus the percentage change in state population in the prior calendar year the bases for initial spending and revenue limits were fiscal year  spending and  property taxes collected in  the base for spending and revenue limits for each subsequent fiscal year is the prior fiscal years spending and property taxes collected in the prior calendar year debt service changes reductions and voterapproved revenue changes are excluded from the calculation bases the amendment also prohibits new or increased real property transfer taxes new state real property taxes and local district income taxes litigation concerning several issues relating to the amendment has been brought in the colorado courts the litigation deals with three principal issues i whether districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on general obligation bonds without obtaining voter approval ii whether a multiyear leasepurchase agreement subject to annual appropriation is an obligation which requires voter approval prior to execution of the agreement and iii what constitutes an enterprise which is excluded from the provisions of the amendment in september  the colorado supreme court held that districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on voter approved general obligation bonds issued after the effective date of the amendment in june  the colorado supreme court validated mill levy increases b to pay general obligation bonds issued prior to the amendment provided that such bonds or bonds issued to refund such bonds were voter approved in late  the colorado court of appeals held that multiyear leasepurchase agreements subject to annual appropriation do not require voter approval the time to file an appeal in that case has expired recently the colorado supreme court ruled that notes to be issued by the state the repayment of which was subject to legislative appropriation must be approved by the voters under the amendment the court distinguished these notes from leasepurchase agreements finally in may  the colorado supreme court ruled that entities with the power to levy taxes may not themselves be enterprises for purposes of the amendment however the court did not address the issue of how valid enterprises may be created many colorado local governments interpret this decision to mean that a government with taxing power cannot be an enterprise but that a business activity such as a utility owned by such a government can be an enterprise additional litigation in the enterprise arena may be filed in the future to clarify these issues the colorado supreme court also has decided that voters can authorize a government to keep and spend all revenues received in excess of the spending limits other aspects of the spending limit are being litigated in district court actions according to the  economic report for fiscal year  general fund revenues adjusted for cash funds that are exempt from the amendment were  million and program revenues cash funds were  million for revenues totaling  million during year  population and inflation grew at rates of  and  respectively for a combined total limit of  accordingly under the amendment state expenditures during the  fiscal year could not exceed  million and the actual  fiscal year general fund and program revenues of  million were over the limit in november  colorado voters defeated a proposition to permit the state to keep and spend a portion of the surplus and the excess of  million is required to be refunded to colorado taxpayers the estimated limitation for fiscal year  is  over the revenue limit for the  fiscal year accordingly  fiscal year revenues cannot exceed an estimated  million fiscal year  revenues are estimated to be  million over the projected limitation which means that there will likely be additional refunds unless voters allow some or all of those revenues to be retained because of the significant anticipated surpluses many permanent tax reductions were passed by the general assembly in  and signed into law by the governor in total taxes were reduced by an estimated  million in fiscal year  the first full year of the majority of the tax cuts the largest tax cut was a reduction in the income tax rate to  effective january   from the previous  rate there is also a statutory restriction on the amount of annual increases in taxes that the various taxing jurisdictions in colorado can levy without electoral approval this restriction does not apply to taxes levied to pay general obligation debt state finances according to state of colorado audited financial reports under generally accepted accounting principles the state had unrestricted general fund ending balances at june  of approximately  million in fiscal year   million for fiscal year   million for fiscal year  and  million for fiscal year  the ending balances starting with fiscal year  are required give effect to hb  which specifies that the refunds required by the amendment are to be booked in the year of the refund rather than in the year incurred for fiscal year  the following tax categories generated the following percentages of the states  million total revenues accrual basis individual income taxes represented  of gross fiscal year  receipts sales use and other excise taxes represented  of gross fiscal year  receipts and corporate income taxes represented  of gross fiscal year  receipts for fiscal year  general fund revenues of approximately  million and appropriations of approximately  million are projected the percentages of general fund revenue generated by type of tax for fiscal year  and  are not expected to be significantly different from fiscal year  percentages state debt under its constitution the state of colorado is not permitted to issue general obligation bonds secured by the full faith and credit of the state however certain agencies and instrumentalities of the state are authorized to issue bonds secured by revenues from specific projects and activities the state enters into certain lease transactions which are subject to annual renewal at the option of the state in addition the state is authorized to issue shortterm revenue anticipation notes local government units in the state are also authorized to incur indebtedness the major source of financing for such local government indebtedness is an ad valorem property tax in addition in order to finance public projects local governments in the state can issue revenue bonds payable from the revenues of a utility or enterprise or from the proceeds of an excise tax or assessment bonds payable from special assessments colorado local governments can also finance public projects through leases which are subject to annual appropriation at the option of the local government local governments in colorado also issue tax anticipation notes the amendment requires prior voter approval for the creation of any multiple fiscal year debt or other financial obligation whatsoever except for refundings at a lower rate or obligations of an enterprise the state has submitted to the voters of the state at the november   election a question of issuing  of revenue anticipation notes the proceeds of which would be used for highway purposes b state economy based on estimates published by the state of colorado office of state planning and budgeting as presented in the  economic report  of nonagricultural employment in colorado in  was concentrated in the retail and

population in  florida was the seventh most populous state in the us florida has grown dramatically since then and as of april   ranks fourth with an estimated population of  million  in  about  more new residents moved into florida than moved out  the us average population increase since  is about  annually while floridas average increase is about  annually  florida continues to be one of the fastest growing of the largest states floridas strong population growth is one reason floridas economy is performing better than the us as a whole in addition to attracting senior citizens to florida as a place for retirement florida is also recognized as attracting a significant number of individuals of working age   in recent years floridas prime working age population  has grown at an average annual rate of more than   more than  of floridas total population is at the working age  this share is not expected to change appreciably into the twentyfirst century income according to the us department of commerce and the florida consensus economic estimating conference personal income in florida has been growing strongly the last several years and has generally performed better than the us as a whole and the southeast us in particular this is due to the fact that floridas population has been growing at a very strong pace and since the early s its economy has diversified providing a broader economic base  floridas real income per person has tracked closely with the us average and has tracked above the southeast florida has a proportionately greater retirement age population than other states as a result property income dividends interest and rent and transfer payments social security and pension benefits among other sources of income are relatively more important sources of income to persons residing in florida transfer payments social security and pension benefits among other sources of income are typically less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy than wages and salaries and other employment income transfer payments social security and pension benefits and other sources of income therefore act as a stabilizing force in weak economic periods the personal income of residents of the various states in the us is frequently used to make comparisons among the various states however using personal income to compare florida to other states can be misleading floridas personal income is systematically underestimated contributions by employers to employees pension profit sharing and other retirement plans are included in personal income of that employee while the employee is working and earning wages and salary when those same employees retire to avoid double accounting retirement payments to them from those retirement plans are excluded in computing personal income florida retirees are more likely to be collecting retirement benefits that they earned in a state other than florida as a result florida personal income is underestimated  floridas personal income per person in  was   the us average personal income per person was slightly higher at   personal income per person in the southeast united states was significantly lower at   total florida real personal income is forecasted to increase  in the fiscal year ended june   and  in the fiscal year ending june    florida real personal income per person is projected to increase  in the fiscal year ended june   and  in the fiscal year ending june    the florida economy appears to be growing in line with but stronger than the us economy however the florida economy is expected to grow more slowly in the fiscal year ending june   than in the fiscal year ended june   employment  since  floridas population has increased an estimated  while the number of employed persons in florida increased  c  in that same period floridas total nonfarm employment has grown approximately  while us nonfarm jobs increased   florida is gradually becoming less dependent on employment related to construction agriculture or manufacturing and more dependent on employment related to trade and services this has also contributed to floridas strong economic performance presently services constitute  and trade  of floridas total nonfarm jobs the us however has a greater percentage of manufacturing jobs than florida manufacturing jobs tend to pay higher wages but service jobs can also pay well and tend to be less sensitive to swings in the business cycle florida has a concentration of manufacturing jobs in hightech and high valueadded sectors such as electrical and electronic equipment as well as printing and publishing these types of manufacturing jobs tend to be less cyclical  floridas unemployment rate throughout the s was consistently lower than that for the us  in the early s floridas unemployment rate was higher than that of the us  in current years floridas unemployment rate has again generally fallen below that of the us  floridas unemployment rate was  during   the us unemployment rate was  during   it is estimated that floridas unemployment rate will be  in the fiscal year ended june   and  in the fiscal year ending june   floridas economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate along with the us but is expected to outperform the us as a whole  total nonfarm employment in florida is expected to increase  for the fiscal year ended june   and  for the fiscal year ending june   trade and services the two largest employment sectors account for more than half of the total nonfarm employment in florida  employment in the service sectors should experience an increase of  for the fiscal year ended june   while growing  for the fiscal year ending june   trade is expected to expand  for the fiscal year ended june   and  for the fiscal year ending june    the service sector is now floridas largest employment category construction in the past floridas economy has been highly dependent on the construction industry and construction related manufacturing this dependency has declined in recent years and continues to decline as a result of continued diversification of floridas economy for example in  total contract construction employment as a share of total nonfarm employment was about  in the late s the share had edged downward to  and in  the share was only  this trend is expected to continue as floridas economy continues to diversify florida nevertheless has a dynamic construction industry with the percentage of housing starts increasing in  by  and construction jobs overall increasing by  due to low interest rates and favorable economic conditions a driving force behind floridas construction industry has been floridas rapid rate of population growth although florida currently is the fourth most populous state its annual population growth is now projected to slow somewhat as the number of people moving into florida is expected to remain over  a year during the next decade this population trend should provide fuel for business and home builders to keep construction activity lively in florida in the next few years moreover recent federal tax reforms reducing capital gains realized on the sale of homes may increase the purchases of second preretirement homes in florida  single and multifamily housing starts in florida for the fiscal year ended june   are projected to reach a combined level of  decreasing slightly to  for the fiscal year ending june    total construction expenditures in florida are forecasted to increase  for the fiscal year ended june   and increase  for the fiscal year ending june    single and

of full faith and credit bonds floridas constitution and statutes require that florida not run a deficit in its budget as a whole or in any separate fund within its budget rather its budget and funds must be kept in balance from currently available revenues each fiscal year if the governor or comptroller believes a deficit will occur in any fund by statute he must certify his opinion to the administrative commission which then is authorized to reduce all florida agency budgets and releases by a sufficient amount to prevent a deficit in any fund additionally the florida constitution prohibits florida from borrowing by issuing bonds to fund its operations litigation currently under litigation are several issues relating to florida actions or florida taxes that put at risk a portion of general revenue fund monies there is no assurance that any of such matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse affect on floridas financial position a brief summary of these matters follows c nathan m hameroff md et al v agency for healthcare administration et al the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of floridas public medical assistance trust fund annual assessment on net operating revenue of free standing outpatient facilities offering sophisticated radiology services the trial has not been scheduled if florida is unsuccessful in its action the potential cost to florida could be  million barnett bank v florida department of revenue this case involves the issue of whether under floridas refund statute for dealer repossessions the florida department of revenue dor is authorized to grant a refund to a financial institution which is the assignee of security agreements governing the sale of automobiles and other property sold through dealers the th judicial circuit found that the statute not only provides a refund or credit to the dealer who sold the tangible personal property and collected and remitted the tax but that the statute also allows the right to the refund to be assigned several banks have already applied for refunds based on this holding and the potential amount in refunds to financial institutions could exceed  million annually dor plans to appeal this decision tower environmental v florida department of environmental protection the plaintiff has alleged that the state of florida and the department of environmental protection dep breached contracts with it by freezing the processing of reimbursement applications and by terminating the petroleum reimbursement process the plaintiff argues alternatively that these actions are torts or impairment of contractual obligations the plaintiff further alleges that the termination of reimbursement claims constitute a breach of contract the plaintiff seeks damages attorneys fees and costs the total of which could reach  million barnett banks inc v florida department of revenue the taxpayer in this case challenged the imposition of interest on additional amounts of corporate income tax due as a result of adjustments under a federal income tax audit that were reported to florida dors historical position is that interest is due from the due date of the return until payment of the additional amount of tax is made the taxpayer contends that interest should begin to accrue only from the date the federal audit adjustments were due to be reported to florida a final order was issued adopting dors position but the taxpayer has appealed the potential lost revenue and refund exposure is in the range of  to  million annually

liabilities include claims pertaining to state employee workers compensation federal civil rights and general and automotive liability the special disability trust fund has a deficit fund balance of

to recognize the year  which means that instead of treating the double zeros at the end of  as indicating the year  the technology treats the double zeros as indicating the year  despite considerable efforts made by the state to bring all of its computer hardware software and embedded technology into compliance so as to recognize the year  there can be no guarantee that year  compliance will be achieved in a timely manner and no assurance made that entities that deal with florida will have achieved year  compliance florida maintains a bond rating of aa aa and aa from moodys investors service

use of our name and to the reference to our firm in said registration statement and in the related prospectus respectfully submitted chapman and cutler exhibit  on chapman and cutler letterhead october   john nuveen  co incorporated  w wacker drive chicago illinois  re nuveen taxfree unit trust series  gentlemen we have served as counsel for you as depositor of nuveen taxfree unit trust series  the fund in connection with the issuance under the trust indenture and agreement dated the date hereof between john nuveen  co incorporated as depositor and the chase manhattan bank as trustee of units of fractional undivided interest the units as evidenced by a book entry position or certificate if requested by the purchaser of units in the one or more trusts of said fund we have also served as counsel for you in connection with all previous series of the nuveen taxfree unit trust and as such have previously examined such pertinent records and documents and matters of law as we have deemed necessary including but not limited to the trust indenture and agreements with respect to those series we have also examined such pertinent records and documents and matters of law as we have deemed necessary including but not limited to the trust indenture and agreement relating to nuveen taxfree unit trust series  we have concluded that the trust indenture and agreement for the fund and its counterpart in each of the prior issues of nuveen taxfree unit trust are in all material respects substantially identical for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes based upon the foregoing and upon such matters of law as we consider to be applicable we are of the opinion that under existing federal income law i each of the trusts will not be an association taxable as a corporation but will be governed by the provisions of subchapter j relating to trusts of chapter  internal revenue code of  the code ii each unitholder will be considered as owning a pro rata share of each asset of the respective trust of the fund in the proportion that the number of units of such trust held by him bears to the total number of outstanding units of such trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code income of each trust will be treated as income of each unitholder of the trust in the proportion described and an item of trust income will have the same character in the hands of a unitholder as it would have in the hands of the trustee accordingly to the extent that the income of a trust consists of interest and original issue discount excludable from gross income under section  of the code such income will be excludable from federal gross income of the unitholders except in the case of a unitholder who is a substantial user or a person related to such user of a facility financed through issuance of any industrial development bonds or certain private activity bonds held by the trust in the case of such unitholder who is a substantial user interest received with respect to his units attributable to such industrial development bonds or such private activity bonds is includable in his gross income moreover in the case of certain corporations interest on all of the bonds is included in computing the alternative minimum tax pursuant to sections c of the code and the branch profits tax imposed by section  of the code with respect to us branches of foreign corporations iii gain or loss will be recognized to a unitholder upon redemption or sale of his units such gain or loss is measured by comparing the proceeds of such redemption or sale with the adjusted basis of the units if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year accordingly unitholders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the trust if any on bonds delivered after the unitholders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unitholders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units such gain or loss is measured by comparing the proceeds of such redemption or sale with the adjusted basis of such units in addition such basis will be increased by both the unitholders aliquot share of the accrued original issue discount and market discount if the unitholder elects to include market discount in income as it accrues with respect to each bond held by the trust with respect to which there was original issue discount at the time the bond was issued or which was purchased with market discount and reduced by the annual amortization of bond premium if any on bonds held by the trust iv if the trustee disposes of a trust asset whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unitholder and the amount thereof is measured by comparing the unitholders aliquot share of the total proceeds from the transaction with his basis for his fractional interest in the asset disposed of such basis is ascertained by apportioning the tax basis for his units among each of the trust assets as of the date on which his units were acquired ratably according to their values as of the valuation date nearest the date on which he purchased such units a unitholders basis in his units and of his fractional interest in each trust asset must be reduced by the amount of his aliquot share of accrued interest received by the trust if any on bonds delivered after the unitholders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on the bonds before the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller must be reduced by the annual amortization of bond premium if any on bonds held by the trust and must be increased by the unitholders share of accrued original issue discount and market discount if the unitholder elects to include market discount in income as it accrues with respect to each bond which at the time the bond was issued had original issue discount or which was purchased with market discount v in the case of any bond held by the trust where the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds the issue price such excess shall be original issue discount with respect to each unitholder upon the purchase of his units subsequent to the original issuance of bonds held by the trust section a of the code provides for a reduction in the accrued daily portion of such original issue discount upon the purchase of a bond subsequent to the bonds original issue under certain circumstances in the case of any bond held by the trust the interest on which is excludable from gross income under section  of the code any original issue discount which accrues with respect thereto will be treated as interest which is excludable from gross income under section  of the code vi in the case of trusts for which mbia insurance corporation mbia insurance with respect to each of the bonds deposited therein has been obtained by the depositor or the issuer or underwriter of the bonds we have examined the form of mbias policy or several policies of insurance the policies which have been delivered to the trustee assuming issuance of policies in such form in our opinion any amounts paid under said policies representing maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in normal course of business by the respective issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds paragraph ii of this opinion is accordingly applicable to policy proceeds representing maturing interest vii certain bonds in the portfolio of the trust have been insured by the issuers underwriters the sponsor or others against default in the prompt payment of principal and interest the insured bonds such insured bonds are so designated on the portfolio pages in the prospectus for each trust insurance on insured bonds is effective so long as such bonds remain outstanding for each of these insured bonds we have been advised that the aggregate principal amount of such bonds listed on the portfolio page was acquired by the trust and are part of the series of such insured bonds in the listed aggregate principal amount based upon the assumption that the insured bonds of the trust are part of a series covered by an insurance policy it is our opinion that any amounts received by the trust representing maturing interest on such insured bonds will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in normal course by the issuer provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the insured bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds paragraph ii of this opinion is accordingly applicable to such payment representing maturing interest because the trusts do not include any private activity bonds within the meaning of section a of the code issued on or after august   none of the trusts interest income shall be treated as an item of tax preference when computing the alternative minimum tax in the case of corporations for taxable years beginning after december   the alternative minimum tax and the superfund tax depend upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments pursuant to section c of the code one of the adjustment items used in computing amti of a corporation other than an s corporation regulated investment company real estate investment trust remic or fasit for tax years beginning in  is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all taxexempt interest including interest on all bonds in the trust and taxexempt original issue discount sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unitholder acquires his units and the price the unitholder pays for his units effective for tax returns filed after december   all taxpayers are required to disclose to the internal revenue service the amount of taxexempt interest earned during the year section  of the code provides for a reduction in each taxable year of  of the otherwise deductible interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by financial institutions to which either section  or section  of the code applies to purchase or carry obligations acquired after august   with certain exceptions the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxes for such taxable year under rules prescribed by section  the amount of interest otherwise deductible by such financial institutions in any taxable year which is deemed to be attributable to taxexempt obligations acquired after august   will generally be the amount that bears the same ratio to the interest deduction otherwise allowable determined without regard to section  to the taxpayer for the taxable year as the taxpayers average adjusted basis within the meaning of section  of taxexempt obligations acquired after august   bears to such average adjusted basis for all assets of the taxpayer we also call attention to the fact that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units is not deductible for federal income tax purposes under rules used by the internal revenue service for determining when borrowed funds are considered used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying particular assets the purchase of units may be considered to have been made with borrowed funds even though the borrowed funds are not directly traceable to the purchase of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred for expenditures of a personal nature such as a mortgage incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects taxexempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to a statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unitholder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unitholders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unitholder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues chapman and cutler has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of federal law ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain taxpayers prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences we have not examined any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and therefore express no opinion as to the exemption from state income taxes of interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder we hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the registration statement file no  relating to the units referred to above and to the use of our name and to the reference to our firm in said registration statement and in the related prospectus respectfully submitted chapman and

taxfree unit trust series   new york plaza  third floor new york ny  re arizona insured trust  gentlemen we have acted as counsel to nuveen taxfree unit trust series  with respect to certain matters preliminary to the issuance and sale of units of interest therein the units pursuant to a trust indenture and agreement dated as of the date hereof the indenture between john nuveen  co incorporated as depositor the depositor and the chase manhattan bank as trustee the trustee the units represent fractional undivided interests in the principal of and net income on obligations deposited in one of several separate trusts including the abovecaptioned trust the trust will be evidenced by a certificate the certificate and will be sold to various investors the unitholders each separate trust will be administered as a distinct entity with separate certificates investments expenses books and records the assets of the trust will consist of interestbearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the state of arizona the state its political subdivisions and authorities the arizona bonds and certain bonds issued by puerto rico authorities the possession bonds collectively the arizona bonds and possession bonds shall be referred to herein as the bonds provided the interest on such bonds received by the trust is exempt from state income taxes distributions of interest on the bonds received by the trust will be made semiannually unless a unitholder elects to receive them monthly or quarterly neither the sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the bonds to be deposited in and held in the trust however although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters it is assumed that i the bonds were validly issued ii the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and iii interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder would be exempt from the arizona income tax the arizona income tax we have assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to the arizona bonds bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the bonds is exempt from the arizona income tax neither the sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith based on the foregoing and review and consideration of existing state laws it is our opinion and we herewith advise you as follows for state income tax purposes each unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the trust and the income of the trust will therefore be treated as the income of the unitholder under state law for state income tax purposes interest on the arizona bonds which is excludable from federal gross income and which is exempt from state income taxes when received by the trust and which would be excluable from federal gross income and exempt from state income taxes if recieved directly by a unitholder will retain its status as taxexempt interest when received by the trust and distributed to the unitholders to the extent that interest derived from the trust by a unitholder with respect to the the arizona bonds is excludable from federal gross income such interest will not be subject to state income taxes interest on the possession bonds which is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the trust will be exempt from arizona income taxation and therefore will not be includable in the income of the unitholders for income tax purposes when distributed by the trust and received by the unitholders each unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss for state income tax purposes when bonds held in the trust are sold exchanged redeemed prior to maturity or paid at maturity or when the unitholder redeems or sells his units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the trust if later state law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units in the trust the interest on which is exempt from state income taxes special rules apply to financial institutions neither the bonds nor the units will be subject to state property taxes sales taxes or use taxes in the case of trusts for which an insurance policy or policies with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the arizona bonds and possession bonds has been obtained by the depositor any proceeds paid under such policy or policies issued to the trust if any with respect to the bonds in the trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be exempt from state income taxes if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds we have not examined any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with respect thereto and therefore express no opinion as to the exemption from state income taxes of interest on the bonds if received directly by a unitholder we hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the registration statement no  filed pursuant to the securities act of  as amended the act with respect to the registration of the sale of the units by nuveen taxfree unit trust series  and to the references to our firm in such registration statement and the preliminary prospectus included therein in giving such consent we do not thereby admit that we are persons whose consent is required by section  of the act or the rules and regulations thereunder very truly yours chapman  cutler exhibit  on sherman  howard llc letterhead october   nuveen taxfree unit trust series  co chase manhattan bank nuveen administration department  new york plazard floor new york new york  re colorado insured trust  ladies and gentlemen we have acted as special counsel to the nuveen taxfree unit trust series  the fund with respect to certain applications of the income tax law of the state of colorado to the above captioned trusts created as part of the fund the colorado trusts and to the holders of certificates or registered holders of book entry positions evidencing ownership of fractional undivided interest units in the colorado trusts who are residents of the state of colorado colorado unitholders in this connection we have examined the form of an opinion of chapman and cutler counsel for john nuveen  co incorporated the depositor to be dated today as to the federal tax status of the several constituent trusts of the fund and the holders of units including the colorado trusts and the colorado unitholders chapman and cutler has advised us that its opinion as executed and delivered will be in all material respects identical to such form we have also examined such pertinent materials and matters of law as we deemed necessary in order to enable us to express the opinions hereinafter set forth it is our understanding that a colorado trust will consist of obligations which were issued by the state of colorado or its political subdivisions or by the united states or possessions of the united states including puerto rico the virgin islands and guam bonds the following opinion assumes that the colorado trusts will have no income other than i interest income on the bonds ii insurance proceeds if any referred to in paragraph  below and iii gain on the disposition of such bonds based on the foregoing and with your permission in reliance upon the opinion of chapman and cutler referred to above it is our opinion that application of existing colorado income tax law would be as follows the chapman and cutler opinion concludes that each trust including the colorado trusts will be governed by the provisions of subchapter j of chapter  internal revenue code of  the code although there are no colorado income tax statutes similar to subchapter j of chapter  of the code the colorado statutory provisions generally operate to reach the same result that is reached under the federal system the income deduction and credit items directly reportable by the owner of a trust under the federal rules are also directly reportable by that same person under colorado rules conversely items of income deduction and credit not reportable for federal purposes typically are not reported for colorado purposes for resident individuals estates and trusts colorado law imposes a tax on federal taxable income as defined in the code with specific modifications for corporations a tax is imposed on net income derived from sources within colorado a corporations net income is defined as federal taxable income again with certain modifications there are two modifications relevent to this opinion first interest income less amortization of premium on obligations of any state or any politcal subdivision thereof must be added to federal taxable income however interest income on obligations of the state of colorado or a political subdivision thereof which are issued on or after may   is specifically excluded from this modification interest income on obligations of the state of colorado or a political subdivision thereof which were issued before may   is also excluded from this modification to the extent that such interest is specifically exempt from income taxation under the laws of the state of colorado authorizing the issuance of such obligations the second relevent modification is that interest income on obligations of the united states and its possessions is subtracted from federal taxable income to the extent it was included in federal taxable income colorado also imposes on individuals estates and trusts an alternative minimum tax based on the federal alternative minimum taxable income determined pursuant to section  of the code as with the modifications to federal taxable income pertaining to interest income on colorado exempt obligations interest income on obligations of the state of colorado and political sudivisions thereof which are issued on or after may   or which were issued prior to may   but have interest specifically exempt from income taxation under the colorado laws authorizing the issuance of such obligations is not included in the modification that otherwise requires that interest income from obligations of states or political subdivisions thereof be added to federal alternative minimum taxable income furthermore interest income on obligations of the united states and its possessions is subtracted from federal alternative minimum taxable income because colorado income tax law is based upon the federal law and in light of the opinion of chapman and cutler the colorado trusts will not be associations taxable as corporations for purposes of colorado income taxation with respect to colorado unitholders in view of the relationship between federal and colorado tax computations described above and the opinion of chapman and cutler referred to above each colorado unitholder will be treated as owning a share of each asset of the colorado unitholders respective colorado trust for colorado income tax purposes in the proportion that the number of units of such colorado trust held by the unitholder bears to the total number of outstanding units of the colorado trust and the income of the colorado trust will therefore be treated as the income of each colorado unitholder under colorado law in the proportion described interest on bonds that would not be included in the base subject to colorado income tax or colorado alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a colorado unitholder will not be included in the base subject to colorado income tax or alternative minimum tax when received by a colorado trust and attributed to such colorado unitholder and when distributed to such colorado unitholder proceeds paid under an insurance policy if any issued to the issuer of the bonds involved to the depositor prior to deposit of the bonds in a colorado trust or to a colorado trust which proceeds represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds and which proceeds would not be included in the base subject to colorado income tax or colorado alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a colorado unitholder will not be included in the base subject to colorado income and alternative minimum tax when received by a colorado trust and attributed to such colorado unitholder and when distributed to such colorado unitholder generally each colorado unitholder will realize gain or loss taxable in colorado when the colorado unitholders respective colorado trust disposes of a bond whether by sale exchange redemption or payment at maturity or when the colorado unitholder redeems or sells units at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for amortization of bond discount or premium and other basis adjustments including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a colorado unitholders share of interest if any accruing on bonds during the interval between the colorado unitholders settlement date and the date such bonds are delivered to the colorado trust if later however beginning in  a colorado unitholder who is an individual a trust or an estate may be able to exclude from colorado taxable income up to  per year  for a married couple filing jointly of gains from the trusts disposition of bonds or from the redemption or sale of the colorado unitholders units under legislation enacted by colorado in  interest income dividend income and net capital gains as defined in section  of the code otherwise includable in taxable income qualify for the exclusion the exclusion will be available only in years during which state revenues exceed by  million indexed annually to relfect the rate of growth in colorado personal income state spending limits mandated by the colorado constitution as such revenue and spending limits are described in the appendix to the information supplement entitled colorado disclosure under the caption economic factorscoloradorestrictions on appropriations and revenues tax cost reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in colorado unitholders realizing gain taxable in colorado when their units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original cost such gain may qualify for the exclusion from colorado taxable income described in paragraph  above during years in which the exclusion becomes available and if interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a colorado unitholder to purchase units in the colorado trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes it will not be deductible for colorado income tax purposes we have not examined any of the bonds to be deposited in the colorado trustss and express no opinion as to whether the interest or if applicable insurance proceeds representing interest on any such bonds would in fact be included in the base subject to colorado income tax or colorado alternative minimum tax if directly received by a colorado unitholder we hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the registration statement file no  relating to the units referred to above and to the use of our name and the reference to our firm in such registration statement and in the related prospectus under the tax status heading for each

among all of the trusts assets ratably according to their values as of the valuation date nearest the date on which he purchased the units a unitholders basis in his units and the basis for his
