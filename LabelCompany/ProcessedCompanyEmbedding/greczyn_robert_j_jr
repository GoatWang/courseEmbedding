clinics north carolina foundation united way bob greczyn brad wilson enlarge bob greczyn blue cross and blue shield of north carolina ceo emeritus email greczbgmailcom enlarge bob greczyn a book that influenced me “reminiscences” by general douglas macarthur i read it when i was growing up and it planted the seeds of leadership bob has lived in the triangle since  he has become one of the most recognized business and community leaders in the region first by leading healthsource north carolina to becoming one of the state’s largest hmos then successfully leading blue cross and blue shield of north carolina for a decade the basics in bob’s resume alone would merit consideration for this award as ceo of the state’s largest health insurer since  leading the resurgence of bcbsnc as a customerfocused company dedicated to improving health more than doubling annual revenue increasing the company’s work force to  when he was promoted to ceo bcbsnc was struggling to win new customers and had posted total operating losses of almost  million in the previous five years in just a few years time bob was recognized as the author of a great turnaround story throughout the decade the company continued to expand by offering competitive products and by starting health programs designed to improve health during bob’s tenure bcbsnc membership has nearly doubled from  million at the end of  to  million today but there’s a lot more to consider beyond these business accomplishments one measure of his success is how laserfocused he has been on improving the health of north carolinians for many decades blue cross was a transactionbased company providing insurance plans and paying claims bob sharpened the company’s focus on improving the health of its customers for example becoming the first health insurer in the nation to provide coverage for obesity and enabling customers to afford needed medications by waiving copayments on generic drugs recognizing that bcbsnc directly touches only about a third of the state’s residents its customers bob found ways to extend that health focus statewide early in his tenure bob was instrumental in creating the blue cross and blue shield of north carolina foundation which has become one of the state’s most significant healthoriented nonprofits bob serves as chairman of the foundation which has invested more than  million in improving the health and wellbeing of north carolinians one example of the foundations success is its commitment to the nc association of free clinics foundation funds have enabled a  percent expansion of the number and reach of free clinics that provide medical care to underserved populations bob has spent as much effort in making the triangle and north carolina a better place to live as he has in strengthening blue cross he has championed the company’s support of the united way serving for many years on the board of the united way of the greater triangle including a term as chairman bob himself has contributed quite generously to meeting needs in the triangle through united way in addition to spearheading many successful drives among bcbsnc employees  million in company and employee contributions over the last  years this is one of many examples of the culture of volunteerism that bob has fostered at blue cross employees log more than  hours each year to help improve the lives of others in their communities bob has announced that he will retire from blue cross in january  he’s certainly leaving the company in good shape having established a strong management team ready to carry forward even in a time of great challenges in health care – from nomination by brad wilson blue cross and blue shield of north carolina qa with  bob greczyn what drove you to pursue your goals i was someone who had a solid work ethic when something excited me health care and ultimately health insurance and the ability to impact millions of lives was a driving force what accomplishment are you most proud of there are many accomplishments i am proud of but being a good husband and father is really important to me and creating opportunities for many people to succeed is also something i am proud of the creation of the bcbsnc foundation also stands out as a child what did you want to be i guess i wanted to be lots of different things with no real focus i always knew i could be anything i wanted to be if i worked hard enough since that was what i was always told what nonprofit and community causes are you most passionate about i am passionate and involved with many organizations part of being successful is an obligation to give back the united way of the greater triangle the new schools project focused on changing the nature of high school education and eliminating dropouts and economic development that keeps north carolina moving forward research triangle regional partnership are key organizations for me what do you see as the biggest challenge facing triangle leaders in the decade ahead triangle and statewide leaders need to not rest on the successes of the past we need to remain aggressive invest in the future innovate and start taking the education of our children a whole lot more seriously or other states and countries will run us over what qualities are going to define tomorrow’s leaders tomorrow’s leaders will be much more diverse and will bring new ways of thinking they will still need passion a focus on quality and they will still have to remember that leadership is a team sport what’s one thing few people know about you no
