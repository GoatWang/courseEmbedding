smalldevelopment gated communities renovations require a special team of goal oriented contractors to ease the processbusiness gov  businesses have special needs and schedules that require professionals with expertise and resources faq will bonness inc accept a credit card yes you may pay for your purchase with mastercard or visa will i need a permit to build a new driveway probably each city and county has its own requirements you will probably at least need a rightofway permit and in some cities you may also be required to have a building permit check with your local authority what should i know before choosing a paving contractor unfortunately the construction industry is plagued with scam artists and driveway paving scams are especially common in our area you can avoid being another victim by following some practical guidelines  be weary of someone selling doortodoor a sure sign of a scam is when a socalled contractor comes to your door claiming to have leftover asphalt after paving another driveway they will offer you a supposed great deal that is only good today a reputable contractor will know with great accuracy how much paving material is needed to complete a project rarely will they have leftover material moreover if the great deal you are offered today is not available tomorrow or next week it is probably a scam  never hire someone on the spot ask for references and check them get a copy of the contractor’s license and certificate of insurance before allowing them on your property  watch out for unmarked trucks or outofarea phone numbers a little research will reveal that they have no permanent address and the phone number is often an answering machine reputable contractors are proud to display their name on their vehicles  insist on a written contract and avoid cash deals a reputable contractor will accept checks or credit cards and will not require cashonly terms  avoid a deal that seems too good to be true if the quoted price seems very low chances are the quality of work will also be quite low if you have any doubts get a second opinion from a locally advertised paving contractor what is asphalt made of and what are its characteristics before you employ a paving contractor to install your asphalt driveway or parking lot it is important that you know what you can expect from the product  asphalt is a mixture of various grades of sand and rock aggregate and a tarlike substance asphalt cement which are heated and blended in an asphalt plant according to a scientifically engineered mix design asphalt is not poured as concrete is but rather laid with an asphalt paver and compacted with rollers the result is a continuous smooth riding surface with no expansion joints it is important that you know that in the process of laying asphalt some raking must be done to assure a uniform thickness this raking is usually performed at joints or seams and in areas where the paver cannot access easily this raking causes some of the larger aggregate to come to the surface you can always expect that there will be some variations of texture in your completed pavement the curing process is also quite different than concrete  asphalt cures over a period of months and even years depending on sun exposure and other factors in the environment  asphalt pavement will remain soft during this time and is susceptible to wheelrashing and other scarring of the surface once the asphalt cures this surface scarring becomes unnoticeable  asphalt pavement typically lasts between  and  years and after its useful life it can be overlaid with a fresh layer of asphalt for more information click here to go to the asphalt contractors association of florida where you will find useful articles links and other

resources faq will bonness inc accept a credit card yes you may pay for your purchase with mastercard or visa will i need a permit to build a new driveway probably each city and county has its own requirements you will probably at least need a rightofway permit and in some cities you may also be required to have a building permit check with your local authority what should i know before choosing a paving contractor unfortunately the construction industry is plagued with scam artists and driveway paving scams are especially common in our area you can avoid being another victim by following some practical guidelines  be weary of someone selling doortodoor a sure sign of a scam is when a socalled contractor comes to your door claiming to have leftover asphalt after paving another driveway they will offer you a supposed great deal that is only good today a reputable contractor will know with great accuracy how much paving material is needed to complete a project rarely will they have leftover material moreover if the great deal you are offered today is not available tomorrow or next week it is probably a scam  never hire someone on the spot ask for references and check them get a copy of the contractor’s license and certificate of insurance before allowing them on your property  watch out for unmarked trucks or outofarea phone numbers a little research will reveal that they have no permanent address and the phone number is often an answering machine reputable contractors are proud to display their name on their vehicles  insist on a written contract and avoid cash deals a reputable contractor will accept checks or credit cards and will not require cashonly terms  avoid a deal that seems too good to be true if the quoted price seems very low chances are the quality of work will also be quite low if you have any doubts get a second opinion from a locally advertised paving contractor what is asphalt made of and what are its characteristics before you employ a paving contractor to install your asphalt driveway or parking lot it is important that you know what you can expect from the product  asphalt is a mixture of various grades of sand and rock aggregate and a tarlike substance asphalt cement which are heated and blended in an asphalt plant according to a scientifically engineered mix design asphalt is not poured as concrete is but rather laid with an asphalt paver and compacted with rollers the result is a continuous smooth riding surface with no expansion joints it is important that you know that in the process of laying asphalt some raking must be done to assure a uniform thickness this raking is usually performed at joints or seams and in areas where the paver cannot access easily this raking causes some of the larger aggregate to come to the surface you can always expect that there will be some variations of texture in your completed pavement the curing process is also quite different than concrete  asphalt cures over a period of months and even years depending on sun exposure and other factors in the environment  asphalt pavement will remain soft during this time and is susceptible to wheelrashing and other scarring of the surface once the asphalt cures this surface scarring becomes unnoticeable  asphalt pavement typically lasts between  and  years and after its useful life it can be overlaid with a fresh layer of asphalt for more information click here to go to the asphalt contractors association of florida where you will find useful articles links and other resources about us bonness inc is a
