future solar thermal power plants are becoming costeffective renewable power technologies and are expected to have increased emphasis as this technology develops solar energy can be converted to electricity in two ways solar thermal power plants generate electricity when heat from solar thermal collectors is used to heat a fluid which produces steam that is used to produce electric power photovoltaic pv devices or “solar cells” – change sunlight directly into electricity pv systems can be residential or large scale generating stations and may be used in remote locations not connected to an electric grid thermon has a full range of heat trace technologies and engineering expertise to provide the heating requirements for any solar related application solar thermal power solar thermal power concentrates heat from the sun the concentrated solar power heats oil which is used to produce steam oil is heated to °c °f in the piping before being heated by the gathered solar energy to produce steam recommended heat trace system thermon miq mineral insulated heating cable molten salt needs to be maintained at °c °f to keep it from solidifying recommended heat trace system thermon miq mineral insulated heating cable freeze protection is required on all steam and cooling water piping recommended heat trace system thermon bsx selfregulating heating cable for the cooling water and thermon miq for the steam and condensate lines photovoltaic photovoltaic cells directly convert sunlight into electricity electrons in the cells become excited when they are struck by sunlight generating dc power which is converted into ac power for distribution photovoltaic cells are produced from raw material called polysilicon polysilicon production plants use water for cooling along
