born john anthony golenor gavin is of mexican and irish descent and is fluent in spanish his father herald ray golenor was of irish origin and his ancestors were early landowners in california when it was still under spanish rule gavins mother delia diana pablos hailed from the historically influential pablos family of sonora mexico after attending st johns military academy los angeles and villanova prep ojai california both catholic schools he earned a ba from stanford university where he did senior honors work in latin american economic history and was a member of stanfords naval rotc unit he graduated with a degree in economics and latin american affairs i never did any acting in school never had any curiosity about college plays he later said my entire thought moved in quite another direction military serviceedit during the korean war gavin was commissioned in the us navy serving aboard the uss princeton offshore korea where he served as an air intelligence officer from  until the end of the war in  due to gavins fluency in both spanish and portuguese he was assigned as flag lieutenant to admiral milton e miles until he completed his fouryear tour of duty in  he received an award due to his work in the honduras floods of  gavin later said in a  interview some people have inferred from what i said in the past im a rich boy which im not and that im doing this for a lark apparently youre either born in abject poverty and rise above it or else youre enormously wealthy the fact that i went to a nice prep school and stanford university has something to do with it i went on a scholarship i have been on my own ever since i got commissioned in the navy i never came into an estate or anything like that entry into actingedit following his naval service gavin offered himself as a technical adviser to family friend bryan foy who was making a movie about the princeton instead foy arranged a screen test with universal gavin originally turned down the offer – he had never acted in college – but his father urged him to try it the test was successful and gavin signed with the studio they offered me so much money i couldnt resist he said later universal studiosedit universal pictures groomed gavin as a virile strapping handsome leading man in the mold of rock hudson they gave him roles in the films behind the high wall four girls in town and quantez he was meant to star in the female animal but was too busy on other projects and was replaced by george nader gavin later remembered when i started out in front of the cameras i was green – raw scared and just plain awful stardom a time to love and a time to dieedit gavins first big break was being given the lead in a time to love and a time to die  from the novel by erich maria remarque this drew comparisons with the casting of the similarlyinexperienced lew ayres in universals film version of all quiet on the western front  i felt that after extensive tests that he could be just right because of his lack of experience said director douglas sirk he was fresh young good looking not pretty though earnest – and had this little dilettante quality i figured would be quite the thing for the lead in this picture i think we have a good man said remarque of gavins casting universal executive al daff called gavin the greatest prospect ive seen in years it changed my entire life said gavin who then went on to add if i should have the good fortune to become a star i certainly dont intend to become a star twentyfour hours a day universal was so excited about gavin they sent a copy of his screen test to critics in advance of the movies release hedda hopper saw a preview and predicted that gavin will take the public by storm and so will the picture he was dubbed universals new white hope publicity consistently drew comparisons with lew ayres the film was not a big success when it was released although gavin was praised by jeanluc godard in an article in cahiers du cinéma for a comparative newcomer he does remarkably well wrote the chicago daily tribune the new york times called him a goodlooking dull young man whose speech attitude and dull delivery betray the tyro firsttime actor from hollywood the los angeles times said he gave a sensible likeable performance never once is one convinced that gavin is anything other than a nice looking american lad just out of college wrote the washington post one can hardly call gavins a performance a series of classic filmsedit before a time to love and a time to die had been released gavin had already been cast by douglas sirk in another important role – supporting lana turner in imitation of life  unlike a time to love and a time to die this was a spectacular success at the box office and gavin was voted most promising male newcomer for his performance in the film by the motion picture exhibitor universal then used him in the epic spartacus  directed by stanley kubrick in a key supporting role as julius caesar he was then cast in the classic thriller psycho  for director alfred hitchcock gavin later claimed he was terribly disturbed by the sex and violence in psycho and felt i think hitch really got frosted with me both movies were spectacularly successful critically and commercially in the words of one writer the success of imitation of life meant gavin was invariably cast as a staunch fellow of good will who looked handsome but was permitted little action opposite his leading ladies he costarred against doris day in the  thriller midnight lace sophia loren in the comedic a breath of scandal which gavin later called a turkey susan hayward in the melodrama back street and with sandra dee in romanoff and juliet and tammy tell me true most of these film were produced by ross hunter gavin also appeared periodically on tv during this time in various anthology series he was directed by a young william friedkin in an episode of the alfred hitchcock hour gavin later claimed that he lacked training support from universal during his early days there when i walked through the gate universal quit building actors all of a sudden i was doing leading roles i knew i was a tyro but they told me to shut up and act some of those early roles were unactable even laurence olivier couldnt have done anything with them the dialog ran to cardboard passages such as i love you you can rely on me darling ill wait it was all i could do to keep from adding with egg on my face so i psyched myself negative there was no studio system to let me work my way up through small roles when i got up on my hind legs no one would believe it he admitted in a  interview that at one stage he even considered quitting acting to take up law i decided to stay after i became aware of what i was doing i dont want to be mediocre and im conceited enough to think i can be good in this business but i really hope its nothing as silly as conceit that makes me say that he added that he wished people would stop comparing him to rock hudson because i cant but help come off second best freelanceedit gavin left universal in  to freelance he signed to make several movies in europe including the assassins the challenge and night call however he pulled out of the assassins which became assassins of rome  night call was never made and the challenge kept getting pushed back and was eventually never made in early  gavin starred in the tv series destry he was quoted during filming when i came to universal they were making  pictures a year i walked through the gate was given a contract and immediately the number of pictures films dropped to eight or nine a year im not complaining because i was given good roles roles with scope and breadth but i wish i could have been put in  or  roles before making my first picture do you know what i mean doing a series now is like putting the cart before the horse im glad to be doing destry now though because of the experience my gosh ive shot more film in the last five weeks than i have in my entire life the series was not a ratings success and was soon cancelled return to universaledit in september  gavin signed a new contract with universal which gave him the option to take work outside the studio he tried another tv series convoy which only had a short run before being cancelled gavin then appeared in a mexican film pedro páramo based on a famous novel i had to do something i was proud of said gavin of the latter movie pedro broke the mould he added i had to break it all the trash ive done i just couldnt do it anymore while filming in mexico gavin heard universal was making an expensive sera julie andrews musical thoroughly modern millie  for george roy hill again for producer ross hunter he lobbied for the role of mary tyler moores stuffy boyfriend to hunter and universal production head ed muhl this is a square square guy so i told them it would be such type casting that they just couldnt get anyone else but me said gavin gavin read for director george roy hill and was cast i told ross im playing a parody of every part ive had in a ross hunter picture said gavin he thought millie had been a breakthrough comedy role for him now im beginning to feel like a journeyman actor and i want a little more dimension in movie roles he said ive developed into a pretty good sunday actor claimed gavin in  although he admitted to making mistakes in his career i have to be beat over the head im intelligent but not smart in june  gavin signed a new nonexclusive contract with universal for five years at one film per year gavin never regained his former prominence but he did get cast in the lead in oss   double agent then called no roses for robert replacing frederick stafford who was filming alfred hitchcocks topaz he also had good supporting roles in the madwoman of chaillot and pussycat pussycat i love you in the latter sending up his own image james bondedit gavin was signed for the role of james bond in the  film diamonds are forever after prior bond george lazenby left the role time was getting awfully short said producer albert broccoli we had to have someone in the bullpen head of united artists david

michele lee beating out tab hunter who also auditioned the producers said gavin got the role because he sings and dances better than hunter and looks great on stage with michele gavin later claimed he

seven months then stayed in it when the show toured the country with lucie arnaz both the broadway and touring production were directed by michael bennett the los angeles times said he gives a solid

university of the americas and villanova preparatory school critical appraisaledit in  hedda hopper claimed she suggested gavin play the lead in back street over william holden or gregory peck as he was a better actor than either of them in  gavin himself reflected for a long time i wondered if i shouldnt have gone into something worthwhile such as being a doctor to the bitter end spencer tracy was also tortured with the same agony ive only recently realized theres the actor in every human being – and to let it out let it happen is a very wonderful very giving thing but i would have been so much happier in the past if i realized that sooner you see i would have relaxed sam stagg author of a book on the making of the imitation of life was critical of gavins performance in that film and a time to love and a time to die in both films gavin is a foreign body he slows them down like a virus that must run its course what he did in this picture he did in all the others – rather its what he didnt do he didnt act with his face his eyes his voice his body he resembles a chiseled monolith and his facial muscles move as rarely as nicole kidmans from the outset critics have called gavin wooden but that critical cliche tells only half if heartthrobs like rock hudson were dreamboats then gavin is a glass bottom boat – in dry dock his depthless transparency exposes his shortcomings

father herald ray golenor was of irish origin and his ancestors were early landowners in california when it was still under spanish rule gavins mother delia diana pablos hailed from the historically influential pablos family of sonora mexico after attending st johns military academy los angeles and villanova prep ojai california both catholic schools he earned a ba from stanford university where he did senior honors work in latin american economic history and was a member of stanfords naval rotc unit he graduated with a degree in economics and latin american affairs i never did any acting in school never had any curiosity about college plays he later said my entire thought moved in quite another direction military serviceedit during the korean war gavin was commissioned in the us navy serving aboard the uss princeton offshore korea where he served as an air intelligence officer from  until the end of the war in  due to gavins fluency in both spanish and portuguese he was assigned as flag lieutenant to admiral milton e miles until he completed his fouryear tour of duty in  he received an award due to his work in the honduras floods of  gavin later said in a  interview some people have inferred from what i said in the past im a rich boy which im not and that im doing this for a lark apparently youre either born in abject poverty and rise above it or else youre enormously wealthy the fact that i went to a nice prep school and stanford university has something to do with it i went on a scholarship i have been on my own ever since i got commissioned in the navy i never came into an estate or anything like that entry into actingedit following his naval service gavin offered himself as a technical adviser to family friend bryan foy who was making a movie about the princeton instead foy arranged a screen test with universal gavin originally turned down the offer – he had never acted in college – but his father urged him to try it the test was successful and gavin signed with the studio they offered me so much money i couldnt resist he said later universal studiosedit universal pictures groomed gavin as a virile strapping handsome leading man in the mold of rock hudson they gave him roles in the films behind the high wall four girls in town and quantez he was meant to star in the female animal but was too busy on other projects and was replaced by george nader gavin later remembered when i started out in front of the cameras i was green – raw scared and just plain awful stardom a time to love and a time to dieedit gavins first big break was being given the lead in a time to love and a time to die  from the novel by erich maria remarque this drew comparisons with the casting of the similarlyinexperienced lew ayres in universals film version of all quiet on the western front  i felt that after extensive tests that he could be just right because of his lack of experience said director douglas sirk he was fresh young good looking not pretty though earnest – and had this little dilettante quality i figured would be quite the thing for the lead in this picture i think we have a good man said remarque of gavins casting universal executive al daff called gavin the greatest prospect ive seen in years it changed my entire life said gavin who then went on to add if i should have the good fortune to become a star i certainly dont intend to become a star twentyfour hours a day universal was so excited about gavin they sent a copy of his screen test to critics in advance of the movies release hedda hopper saw a preview and predicted that gavin will take the public by storm and so will the picture he was dubbed universals new white hope publicity consistently drew comparisons with lew ayres the film was not a big success when it was released although gavin was praised by jeanluc godard in an article in cahiers du cinéma for a comparative newcomer he does remarkably well wrote the chicago daily tribune the new york times called him a goodlooking dull young man whose speech attitude and dull delivery betray the tyro firsttime actor from hollywood the los angeles times said he gave a sensible likeable performance never once is one convinced that gavin is anything other than a nice looking american lad just out of college wrote the washington post one can hardly call gavins a performance a series of classic filmsedit before a time to love and a time to die had been released gavin had already been cast by douglas sirk in another important role – supporting lana turner in imitation of life  unlike a time to love and a time to die this was a spectacular success at the box office and gavin was voted most promising male newcomer for his performance in the film by the motion picture exhibitor universal then used him in the epic spartacus  directed by stanley kubrick in a key supporting role as julius caesar he was then cast in the classic thriller psycho  for director alfred hitchcock gavin later claimed he was terribly disturbed by the sex and violence in psycho and felt i think hitch really got frosted with me both movies were spectacularly successful critically and commercially in the words of one writer the success of imitation of life meant gavin was invariably cast as a staunch fellow of good will who looked handsome but was permitted little action opposite his leading ladies he costarred against doris day in the  thriller midnight lace sophia loren in the comedic a breath of scandal which gavin later called a turkey susan hayward in the melodrama back street and with sandra dee in romanoff and juliet and tammy tell me true most of these film were produced by ross hunter gavin also appeared periodically on tv during this time in various anthology series he was directed by a young william friedkin in an episode of the alfred hitchcock hour gavin later claimed that he lacked training support from universal during his early days there when i walked through the gate universal quit building actors all of a sudden i was doing leading roles i knew i was a tyro but they told me to shut up and act some of those early roles were unactable even laurence olivier couldnt have done anything with them the dialog ran to cardboard passages such as i love you you can rely on me darling ill wait it was all i could do to keep from adding with egg on my face so i psyched myself negative there was no studio system to let me work my way up through small roles when i got up on my hind legs no one would believe it he admitted in a  interview that at one stage he even considered quitting acting to take up law i decided to stay after i became aware of what i was doing i dont want to be mediocre and im conceited enough to think i can be good in this business but i really hope its nothing as silly as conceit that makes me say that he added that he wished people would stop comparing him to rock hudson because i cant but help come off second best freelanceedit gavin left universal in  to freelance he signed to make several movies in europe including the assassins the challenge and night call however he pulled out of the assassins which became assassins of rome  night call was never made and the challenge kept getting pushed back and was eventually never made in early  gavin starred in the tv series destry he was quoted during filming when i came to universal they were making  pictures a year i walked through the gate was given a contract and immediately the number of pictures films dropped to eight or nine a year im not complaining because i was given good roles roles with scope and breadth but i wish i could have been put in  or  roles before making my first picture do you know what i mean doing a series now is like putting the cart before the horse im glad to be doing destry now though because of the experience my gosh ive shot more film in the last five weeks than i have in my entire life the series was not a ratings success and was soon cancelled return to universaledit in september  gavin signed a new contract with universal which gave him the option to take work outside the studio he tried another tv series convoy which only had a short run before being cancelled gavin then appeared in a mexican film pedro páramo based on a famous novel i had to do something i was proud of said gavin of the latter movie pedro broke the mould he added i had to break it all the trash ive done i just couldnt do it anymore while filming in mexico gavin heard universal was making an expensive sera julie andrews musical thoroughly modern millie  for george roy hill again for producer ross hunter he lobbied for the role of mary tyler moores stuffy boyfriend to hunter and universal production head ed muhl this is a square square guy so i told them it would be such type casting that they just couldnt get anyone else but me said gavin gavin read for director george roy hill and was cast i told ross im playing a parody of every part ive had in a ross hunter picture said gavin he thought millie had been a breakthrough comedy role for him now im beginning to feel like a journeyman actor and i want a little more dimension in movie roles he said ive developed into a pretty good sunday actor claimed gavin in  although he admitted to making mistakes in his career i have to be beat over the head im intelligent but not smart in june

production of the fantasticks in  gavin replaced ken howard in the broadway musical seesaw  opposite michele lee beating out tab hunter who also auditioned the producers said gavin got the role

claimed she suggested gavin play the lead in back street over william holden or gregory peck as he was a better actor than either of them in  gavin himself reflected for a long time i wondered if i shouldnt have gone into something worthwhile such as being a doctor to the bitter end spencer tracy was also tortured with the same agony ive only recently realized theres the actor in every human being – and to let it out let it happen is a very wonderful very giving thing but i would have been so much happier in the past if i realized that sooner you see i would have relaxed sam stagg author of a book on the making of the imitation of life was critical of gavins performance in that film and a time to love and a time to die in both films gavin is a foreign body he slows them down like a virus that must run its course what he did in this picture he did in all the others – rather its what he didnt do he didnt act with his face his eyes his voice his body he resembles a chiseled monolith and his facial muscles move as rarely as nicole kidmans from the outset critics have called gavin wooden but that critical cliche tells only half if heartthrobs like rock hudson were dreamboats then gavin is a glass bottom boat – in dry dock his depthless transparency exposes his shortcomings gavin was eye candy lowcalorie but filling and incapable of stealing a scene

biographyedit early lifeedit born john anthony golenor gavin is of mexican and irish descent and is fluent in spanish his father herald ray golenor was of irish origin and his ancestors were early landowners in california when it was still under spanish rule gavins mother delia diana pablos hailed from the historically influential pablos family of sonora mexico after attending st johns military academy los angeles and villanova prep ojai california both catholic schools he earned a ba from stanford university where he did senior honors work in latin american economic history and was a member of stanfords naval rotc unit he graduated with a degree in economics and latin american affairs i never did any acting in school never had any curiosity about college plays he later said my entire thought moved in quite another direction military serviceedit during the korean war gavin was commissioned in the us navy serving aboard the uss princeton offshore korea where he served as an air intelligence officer from  until the end of the war in  due to gavins fluency in both spanish and portuguese he was assigned as flag lieutenant to admiral milton e miles until he completed his fouryear tour of duty in  he received an award due to his work in the honduras floods of  gavin later said in a  interview some people have inferred from what i said in the past im a rich boy which im not and that im doing this for a lark apparently youre either born in abject poverty and rise above it or else youre enormously wealthy the fact that i went to a nice prep school and stanford university has something to do with it i went on a scholarship i have been on my own ever since i got commissioned in the navy i never came into an estate or anything like that entry into actingedit following his naval service gavin offered himself as a technical adviser to family friend bryan foy who was making a movie about the princeton instead foy arranged a screen test with universal gavin originally turned down the offer – he had never acted in college – but his father urged him to try it the test was successful and gavin signed with the studio they offered me so much money i couldnt resist he said later universal studiosedit universal pictures groomed gavin as a virile strapping handsome leading man in the mold of rock hudson they gave him roles in the films behind the high wall four girls in town and quantez he was meant to star in the female animal but was too busy on other projects and was replaced by george nader gavin later remembered when i started out in front of the cameras i was green – raw scared and just plain awful stardom a time to love and a time to dieedit gavins first big break was being given the lead in a time to love and a time to die  from the novel by erich maria remarque this drew comparisons with the casting of the similarlyinexperienced lew ayres in universals film version of all quiet on the western front  i felt that after extensive tests that he could be just right because of his lack of experience said director douglas sirk he was fresh young good looking not pretty though earnest – and had this little dilettante quality i figured would be quite the thing for the lead in this picture i think we have a good man said remarque of gavins casting universal executive al daff called gavin the greatest prospect ive seen in years it changed my entire life said gavin who then went on to add if i should have the good fortune to become a star i certainly dont intend to become a star twentyfour hours a day universal was so excited about gavin they sent a copy of his screen test to critics in advance of the movies release hedda hopper saw a preview and predicted that gavin will take the public by storm and so will the picture he was dubbed universals new white hope publicity consistently drew comparisons with lew ayres the film was not a big success when it was released although gavin was praised by jeanluc godard in an article in cahiers du cinéma for a comparative newcomer he does remarkably well wrote the chicago daily tribune the new york times called him a goodlooking dull young man whose speech attitude and dull delivery betray the tyro firsttime actor from hollywood the los angeles times said he gave a sensible likeable performance never once is one convinced that gavin is anything other than a nice looking american lad just out of college wrote the washington post one can hardly call gavins a performance a series of classic filmsedit before a time to love and a time to die had been released gavin had already been cast by douglas sirk in another important role – supporting lana turner in imitation of life  unlike a time to love and a time to die this was a spectacular success at the box office and gavin was voted most promising male newcomer for his performance in the film by the motion picture exhibitor universal then used him in the epic spartacus  directed by stanley kubrick in a key supporting role as julius caesar he was then cast in the classic thriller psycho  for director alfred hitchcock gavin later claimed he was terribly disturbed by the sex and violence in psycho and felt i think hitch really got frosted with me both movies were spectacularly successful critically and commercially in the words of one writer the success of imitation of life meant gavin was invariably cast as a staunch fellow of good will who looked handsome but was permitted little action opposite his leading ladies he costarred against doris day in the  thriller midnight lace sophia loren in the comedic a breath of scandal which gavin later called a turkey susan hayward in the melodrama back street and with sandra dee in romanoff and juliet and tammy tell me true most of these film were produced by ross hunter gavin also appeared periodically on tv during this time in various anthology series he was directed by a young william friedkin in an episode of the alfred hitchcock hour gavin later claimed that he lacked training support from universal during his early days there when i walked through the gate universal quit building actors all of a sudden i was doing leading roles i knew i was a tyro but they told me to shut up and act some of those early roles were unactable even laurence olivier couldnt have done anything with them the dialog ran to cardboard passages such as i love you you can rely on me darling ill wait it was all i could do to keep from adding with egg on my face so i psyched myself negative there was no studio system to let me work my way up through small roles when i got up on my hind legs no one would believe it he admitted in a  interview that at one stage he even considered quitting acting to take up law i decided to stay after i became aware of what i was doing i dont want to be mediocre and im conceited enough to think i can be good in this business but i really hope its nothing as silly as conceit that makes me say that he added that he wished people would stop comparing him to rock hudson because i cant but help come off second best freelanceedit gavin left universal in  to freelance he signed to make several movies in europe including the assassins the challenge and night call however he pulled out of the assassins which became assassins of rome  night call was never made and the challenge kept getting pushed back and was eventually never made in early  gavin starred in the tv series destry he was quoted during filming when i came to universal they were making  pictures a year i walked through the gate was given a contract and immediately the number of pictures films dropped to eight or nine a year im not complaining because i was given good roles roles with scope and breadth but i wish i could have been put in  or  roles before making my first picture do you know what i mean doing a series now is like putting the cart before the horse im glad to be doing destry now though because of the experience my gosh ive shot more film in the last five weeks than i have in my entire life the series was not a ratings success and was soon cancelled return to universaledit in september  gavin signed a new contract with universal which gave him the option to take work outside the studio he tried another tv series convoy which only had a short run before being cancelled gavin then appeared in a mexican film pedro páramo based on a famous novel i had to do something i was proud of said gavin of the latter movie pedro broke the mould he added i had to break it all the trash ive done i just couldnt do it anymore while filming in mexico gavin heard universal was making an expensive sera julie andrews musical thoroughly modern millie  for george roy hill again for producer ross hunter he lobbied for the role of mary tyler moores stuffy boyfriend to hunter and universal production head ed muhl this is a square square guy so i told them it would be such type casting that they just couldnt get anyone else but me said gavin gavin read for director george roy hill and was cast i told ross im playing a parody of every part ive had in a ross hunter picture said gavin he thought millie had been a breakthrough comedy role for him now im beginning to feel like a journeyman actor and i want a little more dimension in movie roles he said ive developed into a pretty good sunday actor claimed gavin in  although he admitted to making mistakes in his career i have to be beat over the head im intelligent but not smart in june  gavin signed a new nonexclusive contract with universal for five years at one film per year gavin never regained his former prominence but he did get cast in the lead in oss   double agent then called no roses for robert replacing frederick

ken howard in the broadway musical seesaw  opposite michele lee beating out tab hunter who also auditioned the producers said gavin got the role because he sings and dances better than hunter and

university the national park foundation the southwest museum the university of the americas and villanova preparatory school critical appraisaledit in  hedda hopper claimed she suggested gavin play the lead in back street over william holden or gregory peck as he was a better actor than either of them in  gavin himself reflected for a long time i wondered if i shouldnt have gone into something worthwhile such as being a doctor to the bitter end spencer tracy was also tortured with the same agony ive only recently realized theres the actor in every human being – and to let it out let it happen is a very wonderful very giving thing but i would have been so much happier in the past if i realized that sooner you see i would have relaxed sam stagg author of a book on the making of the imitation of life was critical of gavins performance in that film and a time to love and a time to die in both films gavin is a foreign body he slows them down like a virus that must run its course what he did in this picture he did in all the others – rather its what he didnt do he didnt act with his face his eyes his voice his body he resembles a chiseled monolith and his facial muscles move as rarely as nicole kidmans from the outset critics have called gavin wooden but that critical cliche tells only half if heartthrobs like rock hudson were dreamboats then gavin is a glass bottom boat

born john anthony golenor gavin is of mexican and irish descent and is fluent in spanish his father herald ray golenor was of irish origin and his ancestors were early landowners in california when it was still under spanish rule gavins mother delia diana pablos hailed from the historically influential pablos family of sonora mexico after attending st johns military academy los angeles and villanova prep ojai california both catholic schools he earned a ba from stanford university where he did senior honors work in latin american economic history and was a member of stanfords naval rotc unit he graduated with a degree in economics and latin american affairs i never did any acting in school never had any curiosity about college plays he later said my entire thought moved in quite another direction military serviceedit during the korean war gavin was commissioned in the us navy serving aboard the uss princeton offshore korea where he served as an air intelligence officer from  until the end of the war in  due to gavins fluency in both spanish and portuguese he was assigned as flag lieutenant to admiral milton e miles until he completed his fouryear tour of duty in  he received an award due to his work in the honduras floods of  gavin later said in a  interview some people have inferred from what i said in the past im a rich boy which im not and that im doing this for a lark apparently youre either born in abject poverty and rise above it or else youre enormously wealthy the fact that i went to a nice prep school and stanford university has something to do with it i went on a scholarship i have been on my own ever since i got commissioned in the navy i never came into an estate or anything like that entry into actingedit following his naval service gavin offered himself as a technical adviser to family friend bryan foy who was making a movie about the princeton instead foy arranged a screen test with universal gavin originally turned down the offer – he had never acted in college – but his father urged him to try it the test was successful and gavin signed with the studio they offered me so much money i couldnt resist he said later universal studiosedit universal pictures groomed gavin as a virile strapping handsome leading man in the mold of rock hudson they gave him roles in the films behind the high wall four girls in town and quantez he was meant to star in the female animal but was too busy on other projects and was replaced by george nader gavin later remembered when i started out in front of the cameras i was green – raw scared and just plain awful stardom a time to love and a time to dieedit gavins first big break was being given the lead in a time to love and a time to die  from the novel by erich maria remarque this drew comparisons with the casting of the similarlyinexperienced lew ayres in universals film version of all quiet on the western front  i felt that after extensive tests that he could be just right because of his lack of experience said director douglas sirk he was fresh young good looking not pretty though earnest – and had this little dilettante quality i figured would be quite the thing for the lead in this picture i think we have a good man said remarque of gavins casting universal executive al daff called gavin the greatest prospect ive seen in years it changed my entire life said gavin who then went on to add if i should have the good fortune to become a star i certainly dont intend to become a star twentyfour hours a day universal was so excited about gavin they sent a copy of his screen test to critics in advance of the movies release hedda hopper saw a preview and predicted that gavin will take the public by storm and so will the picture he was dubbed universals new white hope publicity consistently drew comparisons with lew ayres the film was not a big success when it was released although gavin was praised by jeanluc godard in an article in cahiers du cinéma for a comparative newcomer he does remarkably well wrote the chicago daily tribune the new york times called him a goodlooking dull young man whose speech attitude and dull delivery betray the tyro firsttime actor from hollywood the los angeles times said he gave a sensible likeable performance never once is one convinced that gavin is anything other than a nice looking american lad just out of college wrote the washington post one can hardly call gavins a performance a series of classic filmsedit before a time to love and a time to die had been released gavin had already been cast by douglas sirk in another important role – supporting lana turner in imitation of life  unlike a time to love and a time to die this was a spectacular success at the box office and gavin was voted most promising male newcomer for his performance in the film by the motion picture exhibitor universal then used him in the epic spartacus  directed by stanley kubrick in a key supporting role as julius caesar he was then cast in the classic thriller psycho  for director alfred hitchcock gavin later claimed he was terribly disturbed by the sex and violence in psycho and felt i think hitch really got frosted with me both movies were spectacularly successful critically and commercially in the words of one writer the success of imitation of life meant gavin was invariably cast as a staunch fellow of good will who looked handsome but was permitted little action opposite his leading ladies he costarred against doris day in the  thriller midnight lace sophia loren in the comedic a breath of scandal which gavin later called a turkey susan hayward in the melodrama back street and with sandra dee in romanoff and juliet and tammy tell me true most of these film were produced by ross hunter gavin also appeared periodically on tv during this time in various anthology series he was directed by a young william friedkin in an episode of the alfred hitchcock hour gavin later claimed that he lacked training support from universal during his early days there when i walked through the gate universal quit building actors all of a sudden i was doing leading roles i knew i was a tyro but they told me to shut up and act some of those early roles were unactable even laurence olivier couldnt have done anything with them the dialog ran to cardboard passages such as i love you you can rely on me darling ill wait it was all i could do to keep from adding with egg on my face so i psyched myself negative there was no studio system to let me work my way up through small roles when i got up on my hind legs no one would believe it he admitted in a  interview that at one stage he even considered quitting acting to take up law i decided to stay after i became aware of what i was doing i dont want to be mediocre and im conceited enough to think i can be good in this business but i really hope its nothing as silly as conceit that makes me say that he added that he wished people would stop comparing him to rock hudson because i cant but help come off second best freelanceedit gavin left universal in  to freelance he signed to make several movies in europe including the assassins the challenge and night call however he pulled out of the assassins which became assassins of rome  night call was never made and the challenge kept getting pushed back and was eventually never made in early  gavin starred in the tv series destry he was quoted during filming when i came to universal they were making  pictures a year i walked through the gate was given a contract and immediately the number of pictures films dropped to eight or nine a year im not complaining because i was given good roles roles with scope and breadth but i wish i could have been put in  or  roles before making my first picture do you know what i mean doing a series now is like putting the cart before the horse im glad to be doing destry now though because of the experience my gosh ive shot more film in the

gavin heard universal was making an expensive sera julie andrews musical thoroughly modern millie  for george roy hill again for producer ross hunter he lobbied for the role of mary tyler moores stuffy boyfriend to hunter and universal production head ed muhl this is a square square guy so i told them it would be such type casting that they just couldnt get anyone else but me said gavin gavin read for director george roy hill and was cast i told ross im playing a parody of every part ive had in a ross hunter picture said gavin he thought millie had been a breakthrough comedy role for him

was a better actor than either of them in  gavin himself reflected for a long time i wondered if i shouldnt have gone into something worthwhile such as being a doctor to the bitter end spencer tracy was also tortured with the same agony ive only recently realized theres the actor in every human being – and to let it out let it happen is a very wonderful very giving thing but i would have been so much happier in the past if i realized that sooner you see i would have relaxed sam stagg author of a book on the making of the imitation of life was critical of gavins performance in that film and a time to love and a time to die in both films gavin is a foreign body he slows them down like a virus that must run its course what he did in this picture he did in all the others – rather its what he didnt do he didnt act with his face his eyes his voice his body he resembles a chiseled monolith and his facial muscles move as rarely as nicole kidmans from the outset critics have called gavin wooden but that critical cliche tells only half if heartthrobs like rock hudson were dreamboats then gavin is a glass bottom boat – in dry dock his depthless transparency exposes his shortcomings

times called him a goodlooking dull young man whose speech attitude and dull delivery betray the tyro firsttime actor from hollywood the los angeles times said he gave a sensible likeable performance never once is one convinced that gavin is anything other than a nice looking american lad just out of college wrote the washington post one can hardly call gavins a performance a series of classic filmsedit before a time to love and a time to die had been released gavin had already been cast by douglas sirk in another important role – supporting lana turner in imitation of life  unlike a time to love and a time to die this was a spectacular success at the box office and gavin was voted most promising male newcomer for his performance in the film by the motion picture exhibitor universal then used him in the epic spartacus  directed by stanley kubrick in a key supporting role as julius caesar he was then cast in the classic thriller psycho  for director alfred hitchcock gavin later claimed he was terribly disturbed by the sex and violence in psycho and felt i think hitch really got frosted with me both movies were spectacularly successful critically and commercially in the words of one writer the success of imitation of life meant gavin was invariably cast as a staunch fellow of good will who looked handsome but was permitted little action opposite his leading ladies he costarred against doris day in the  thriller midnight lace sophia loren in the comedic a breath of scandal which gavin later called a turkey susan hayward in the melodrama back street and with sandra dee in romanoff and juliet and tammy tell me true most of these film were produced by ross hunter gavin also appeared periodically on tv during this time in various anthology series he was directed by a young william friedkin in an episode of the alfred hitchcock hour gavin later claimed that he lacked training support from universal during his early days there when i walked through the gate universal quit building actors all of a sudden i was doing leading roles i knew i was a tyro but they told me to shut up and act some of those early roles were unactable even laurence olivier couldnt have done anything with them the dialog ran to cardboard passages such as i love you you can rely on me darling ill wait it was all i could do to keep from adding with egg on my face so i psyched myself negative there was no studio system to let me work my way up through small roles when i got up on my hind legs no one would believe it he admitted in a  interview that at one stage he even considered quitting acting to take up law i decided to stay after i became aware of what i was doing i dont want to be mediocre and im conceited enough to think i can be good in this business but i really hope its nothing as silly as conceit that makes me say that he added that he wished people would stop comparing him to rock hudson because i cant but help come off second best freelanceedit

millie  for george roy hill again for producer ross hunter he lobbied for the role of mary tyler moores stuffy boyfriend to hunter and universal production head ed muhl this is a square square guy so i told them it would be such type casting that they just couldnt get anyone else but me said gavin gavin read for director george roy hill and was cast i told ross im playing a parody of every part ive had in a ross hunter picture said gavin he thought millie had been a breakthrough comedy role for him now im beginning to feel like a journeyman actor and i want a little more dimension in movie

claimed she suggested gavin play the lead in back street over william holden or gregory peck as he was a better actor than either of them in  gavin himself reflected for a long time i wondered if i shouldnt have gone into something worthwhile such as being a doctor to the bitter end spencer tracy was also tortured with the same agony ive only recently realized theres the actor in every human being – and to let it out let it happen is a very wonderful very giving thing but i would have been so much happier in the past if i realized that sooner you see i would have relaxed sam stagg author of a book on the making of the imitation of life was critical of gavins performance in that film and a time to love and a time to die in both films gavin is a foreign body he slows them down like a virus that must run its course what he did in this picture he did in all the others – rather its what he didnt do he didnt act with his face his eyes his voice his body he resembles a chiseled monolith and his facial muscles move as rarely as nicole kidmans from the outset critics have called gavin wooden but that critical cliche tells only half if heartthrobs like rock hudson were

academy los angeles and villanova prep ojai california both catholic schools he earned a ba from stanford university where he did senior honors work in latin american economic history and was a member of stanfords naval rotc unit he graduated with a degree in economics and latin american affairs i never did any acting in school never had any curiosity about college plays he later said my entire thought moved in quite another direction military serviceedit during the korean war gavin was commissioned in the us navy serving aboard the uss princeton offshore korea where he served as an air intelligence officer from  until the end of the war in  due to gavins fluency in both spanish and portuguese he was assigned as flag lieutenant to admiral milton e miles until he completed his fouryear tour of duty in  he received an award due to his work in the honduras floods of  gavin later said in a  interview some people have inferred from what i said in the past im a rich boy which im not and that im doing this for a lark apparently youre either born in abject poverty and rise above it or else youre enormously wealthy the fact that i went to a nice prep school and stanford university has something to do with it i went on a scholarship i have been on my own ever since i got commissioned in the navy i never came into an estate or anything like that entry into actingedit following his naval service gavin offered himself as a technical adviser to family friend bryan foy who was making a movie about the princeton instead foy arranged a screen test with universal gavin originally turned down the offer – he had never acted in college – but his father urged him to try it the test was successful and gavin signed with the studio they offered me so much money i couldnt resist he said later universal studiosedit universal pictures groomed gavin as a virile strapping handsome leading man in the mold of rock hudson they gave him roles in the films behind the high wall four girls in town and quantez he was meant to star in the female animal but was too busy on other projects and was replaced by george nader gavin later remembered when i started out in front of the cameras i was green – raw scared and just plain awful stardom a time to love and a time to dieedit gavins first big break was being given the lead in a time to love and a time to die  from the novel by erich maria remarque this drew comparisons with the casting of the similarlyinexperienced lew ayres in universals film version of all quiet on the western front  i felt that after extensive tests that he could be just right because of his lack of experience said director douglas sirk he was fresh young good looking not pretty though earnest – and had this little dilettante quality i figured would be quite the thing for the lead in this picture i think we have a good man said remarque of gavins casting universal executive al daff called gavin the greatest prospect ive seen in years it changed my entire life said gavin who then went on to add if i should have the good fortune to become a star i certainly dont intend to become a star twentyfour hours a day universal was so excited about gavin they sent a copy of his screen test to critics in advance of the movies release hedda hopper saw a preview and predicted that gavin will take the public by storm and so will the picture he was dubbed universals new white hope publicity consistently drew comparisons with lew ayres the film was not a big success when it was released although gavin was praised by jeanluc godard in an article in cahiers du cinéma for a comparative newcomer he does remarkably well wrote the chicago daily tribune the new york times called him a goodlooking dull young man whose speech attitude and dull delivery betray the tyro firsttime actor from hollywood the los angeles times said he gave a sensible likeable performance never once is one convinced that gavin is anything other than a nice looking american lad just out of college wrote the washington post one can hardly call gavins a performance a series of classic filmsedit before a time to love and a time to die had been released gavin had already been cast by douglas sirk in another important role – supporting lana turner in imitation of life  unlike a time to love and a time to die this was a spectacular success at the box office and gavin was voted most promising male newcomer for his performance in the film by the motion picture exhibitor universal then used him in the epic spartacus  directed by stanley kubrick in a key supporting role as julius caesar he was then cast in the classic thriller psycho  for director alfred hitchcock gavin later claimed he was terribly disturbed by the sex and violence in psycho and felt i think hitch really got frosted with me both movies were spectacularly successful critically and commercially in the words of one writer the success of imitation of life meant gavin was

through small roles when i got up on my hind legs no one would believe it he admitted in a  interview that at one stage he even considered quitting acting to take up law i decided to stay after i became aware of what i was doing i dont want to be mediocre and im conceited enough to think i can be good in this business but i really hope its nothing as silly as conceit that makes me say that he added that he wished people would stop comparing him to rock hudson because i cant but help come off second best freelanceedit gavin left universal in  to freelance he signed to make several movies in
