effective time of the merger cash will be paid to epe unitholders in accordance with the merger agreement in lieu of any fractional units they otherwise would have been entitled to receive based on the cash distributions paid in november  by epe and epd this will result in a  percent increase in cash distributions for the unitholders of epe as previously announced the transaction has resulted in the cancellation of the  economic general partner interest in epd and the general partner incentive distribution rights in connection with the merger closing an affiliate of epco has agreed to waive the distributions that it would otherwise be entitled to receive on certain epd common units for the next five years “enterprise gp holdings is pleased to complete this merger” stated dr ralph s

of this merger is a major event in the history of enterprise products partners” said michael a creel president and chief executive officer of epd “the permanent elimination of our general partner’s incentive distribution rights reduces our longterm cost of equity capital which will allow us to generate more accretion in terms of distributable cash flow as we continue to grow our partnership the merger also simplifies our ownership structure” with the completion of the merger epe has merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of epd the surviving entity continues to hold noncontrolling interests
