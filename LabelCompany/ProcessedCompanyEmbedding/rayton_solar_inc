innovate how this bill nyeendorsed startup plans to upend the solar industry rayton solar creates its solar panels in a completely new way by kevin j ryan kevin j ryan is a staff writer for inc he has written for espn the magazine and the long island press and contributed to mental floss he lives in queens new york whereskr staff writer incwhereskr  comments credit getty images solar energy might very well be the way of the futurebut it still has a ways to go less than one percent of all us energy consumption comes from solar a number thats remained low largely because consumers are scared off by the high initial costs and the aesthetics a startup out of los angeles thinks it has a solution to one of those problems rayton solar says it has found a way to manufacture solar panels using a high tech process that can shave costs by up to  percent raytons process uses less material and creates less waste driving down the price for both the company and its potential customers silicon the key component of solar panels also happens to be the most expensive solar panels and electronics are conventionally manufactured by taking a block of silicon and trimming it down using a wire saw its a process that wastes up to  percent of the silicon turning it into sawdust or unusable shardswhich isnt a huge deal if youre creating the tiny chips that go into phones and computers but becomes much more significant when making large panels and lots of waste means high prices for the consumer the average solar installation can run around  before tax incentives rayton found a way to avoid creating much of that waste the companys founder andrew yakub previously worked in uclas particle beam physics lab and founded a government grantbased solar energy company regen america using a technique called ion implantation which yakub says has been used since the s but is yet to be commercialized rayton injects protons at specific depth within the atoms of a chunk of silicon technicians then apply heat which lets them trim off a thin slice of silicon with very little waste produced the decreased manufacturing costs mean rayton can afford to use the highest grade silicon availablethe same grade used in nasas technology the silicon wafers it slices off are  microns thick compared to the industry standard of about  microns and less silicon used also contributes to a lower cost to manufacture overall yakub says his panels can be  percent more efficient than the industry standard while using about  percent of the material to help market raytons productand offer some assurance of its viabilityyakub reached out to a giant in the science community bill nye after much back and forth between yakub and nyes agent earlier this year the science guy agreed to come check out the product at raytons la headquarters yakub says it was only after he spent hours asking questions and carefully vetting the product that nye agreed to put his name behind it he then filmed a video explaining the science behind raytons process which the company now proudly displays on its site that was a new experience yakub says being a scientist you dont really get to do much work with celebrities rayton currently has six employees and has raised  million in funding  of which came through accredited investor portal fundablecom the solar panels are now in the design stage and yakub hopes to begin manufacturing for consumers in about  months check out nyes explainer video of the technology below published on sep 7  microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized

profile    business plan f  updates  rayton solar inc has developed the technology to produce solar panels that are  cheaper than the industry standard and are  more efficient rayton is entering a  billion solar panel market with the lowest manfucturing cost and higher cell efficiency rayton solar incs technology allows solar to be cost competitive with fossil fuels without the need for government subsidies the conventional solar manufacturing process wastes an unnecessarily large amount of silicon the industry standard is to cut a raw silicon ingot with a diamond wire which wastes more than half of the silicon ingot additionally wafers can not be cut thinner than  microns due to mechanical friction less than  microns is needed for the silicon to be a charge carrier so this extra material in conventional wafers is an unnecessary expense by using a particle accelerator rather than a diamond wire rayton solar can produce silicon wafers that are  microns thick  rayton solar is the only company in the world that can produce  micron thick silicon without any waste thus reducing the amount of silicon used per solar module by a factor of xx this leads to an overall  reduction in manufacturing cost and a kwh price on par with the cheapest fossil fuels  based in the united states americans today are choosing to buy local products because it keeps business and jobs
