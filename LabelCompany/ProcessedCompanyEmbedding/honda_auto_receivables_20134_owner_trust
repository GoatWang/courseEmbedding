calif  oct  — more automakers are providing responsive and responsiveadaptive websites—sites that automatically reformat to fit the device on which they’re being viewed—yet their satisfaction still trails traditional sites overall according to the jd power  automotive mobile site studysm released todaynearly threefourths  of manufacturers now offer some form of responsive website—up from   months ago—in part because overall mobile usage for automotive shopping continues to trend upwardsatisfaction is important to manufacturers because it increases the likelihood of a shopper taking a test drive the study shows that among vehicle shoppers who are delighted with their experience on a manufacturer brand website overall satisfaction scores above   say they are more likely to test drive a vehicle compared with only  of those who are disappointed scores of  and belowbut designing and executing an effective site that will be viewed through multiple devices is not that easy  the study finds that when manufacturers launch a responsive or responsiveadaptive site navigation and speed satisfaction usually experience the biggest drops after implementation over time though satisfaction with such websites has shown improvement for example when examining the first manufacturer sites that transitioned to responsive design overall satisfaction has increased to  in  from  in  driven by significant increases in speed satisfaction  in  vs  in “automotive manufacturer and thirdparty websites are increasingly being accessed via smartphones by newvehicle shoppers” said deirdre

shopping experience regardless of device”automakers and thirdparty companies use one of three typical web design approachesresponsive provides optimal viewing of one layout that adjusts the content display based on the screen sizeadaptive offers several distinct layouts optimized for various device types adaptive sites must maintain separate contentasset libraries for each layout thereby increasing costresponsiveadaptive is a hybrid technique that adjusts the layoutcontent based on the screen size but also senses the device type thus allowing for customized content and navigation for that device typethe study also finds that satisfaction with manufacturers’ mobile websites is quite different between boomers and gen y satisfaction is significantly lower among vehicle shoppers in
