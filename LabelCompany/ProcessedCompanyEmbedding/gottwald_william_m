typically big business code for a potential sale or spinoff in an sec filing dated sept  the gottwalds who are brothers said the publicly traded tredegar would be best served by considering such alternatives they did not elaborate on what those might be “john d gottwald and william m gottwald are considering their options as substantial shareholders of tredegar and may take such actions with respect to their investment as they deem appropriate” the filing said that determination was made in light of actions taken by the company’s board and management its financial condition its stock price and other factors the filing stated the filing is a public power play between big richmond names and a local company that typically keep fairly low profiles john gottwald is tredegar’s former
