february   the termination date the fund will attempt to strike a balance between the two objectives seeking to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the funds overall credit performance on the one hand and its objective of returning the original nav on or about the termination date on the other however as the fund approaches the termination date its monthly distributions are likely to decline and there are can be no assurance that the fund will achieve either of its investment objectives or that the funds investment strategies will be successful under normal market conditions the fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing at least  of its managed assets in senior secured floatingrate loans senior loans of any maturity senior loans are made to us and nonus corporations partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions senior loans are typically rated below investment grade as it nears the termination date the fund may invest in higher credit quality instruments with maturities extending beyond the termination date to seek to improve the liquidity of its portfolio and reduce investment risk investing in higher credit quality instruments may reduce the amount available for distribution to common shareholders first trust advisors lp the funds investment advisor along with its affiliate first trust portfolios lp are privatelyheld companies which provide a variety of investment services including asset management and financial advisory services with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately  billion as of april   through unit investment trusts exchangetraded funds closedend funds mutual funds and separate managed accounts past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors the fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade which are commonly referred to as junk or high yield securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the fund and such defaults could reduce the funds nav and income distributions an economic downturn would generally lead to a higher nonpayment rate and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs moreover any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid which would adversely affect the senior loans value senior loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment causing the fund to experience a reduction in the income it receives from a senior loan in addition the market value of senior loans may fall in a declining interest rate environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset many senior loans have a minimum base rate or floor typically a libor floor which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum base rate to the extent the fund invests in such senior loans the fund may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in senior loans without any floors until rates rise to levels above the libor floors as a result the fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage specifically if the funds borrowings have floating dividend or interest rates its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase in this situation the fund will experience increased financing costs without the benefit of receiving higher income this in turn may result in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for dividends or distributions to be made by the fund the funds limited term may cause it to invest in loweryielding securities or hold the proceeds of securities sold near the end of its term in cash or cash equivalents which may adversely affect the performance of the fund or the funds ability to maintain its dividend a second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the borrowers obligation under the interest because second lien loans are second to first lien loans they present a greater degree of investment risk specifically these loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority in addition loans that have a lower than first lien priority on collateral of the borrower generally have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid however second lien loans often pay interest at higher rates than first lien loans reflecting such additional risks because the assets of the fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not including at times when market conditions are not favorable or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy or otherwise in severe distress which may cause the fund to lose money although the fund has an investment objective of returning original nav to common shareholders on or about the termination date the fund may not be successful in achieving this objective the return of original nav is not an express or implied guarantee obligation of the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to return original nav to common shareholders and such return is not backed or otherwise guaranteed by the advisor or any other entity the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus shareholder reports and other regulatory filings the fund’s daily closing

shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value nav which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than nav premium or less than nav discount  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news  literature section of the website for estimates of distribution sources final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after yearend  a measure of a bonds sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bonds price given a change in yield it accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements  the annualized return that would be earned on a debt security if held to maturity weighted by the value of each debt security in the funds portfolio the calculation does not include the effect of fund fees and expenses  a shortterm funding rate estimated by banks in london that they would be charged if borrowing from other banks assuming a three month maturity  total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions at prices obtained by the dividend reinvestment plan if any and changes in the nav and share price the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade which are commonly referred to as junk or high yield securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the fund and such defaults could reduce the funds nav and income distributions an economic downturn would generally lead to a higher nonpayment rate and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs moreover any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid which would adversely affect the senior loans value senior loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment causing the fund to experience a reduction in the income it receives from a senior loan in addition the market value of senior loans may fall in a declining interest rate environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset many senior loans have a minimum base rate or floor typically a libor floor which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum base rate to the extent the fund invests in such senior loans the fund may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in senior loans without any floors until rates rise to levels above the libor floors as a result the fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage specifically if the funds borrowings have floating dividend or interest rates its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase in this situation the fund will experience increased financing costs without the benefit of receiving higher income this in turn may result in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for dividends or distributions to be made by the fund the funds limited term may cause it to invest in loweryielding securities or hold the proceeds of securities sold near the end of its term in cash or cash equivalents which may adversely affect the performance of the fund or the funds ability to maintain its dividend a second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the borrowers obligation under the interest and present a greater degree of investment risk these loans are also subject to the risk that borrower cash flow and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority these loans also have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid however second lien loans often pay interest at higher rates than first lien loans reflecting such additional risks because the assets of the fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not including at times when market conditions are not favorable or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy or otherwise in severe distress which may cause the fund to lose money although the fund has an investment objective of returning original nav to common shareholders on or about the termination date the fund may not be successful in achieving this objective the return of original nav is not an express or implied guarantee obligation of the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to return original nav to common shareholders and such return is not backed or
