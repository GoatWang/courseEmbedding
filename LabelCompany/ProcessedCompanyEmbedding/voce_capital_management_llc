to settle proxy contest conmed refuses to appoint independent nominees jim green and josh levine to board board misrepresents the facts about its faux attempts to “negotiate” with voce august    am eastern daylight time san franciscobusiness wirevoce capital management llc “voce” made the following statement today relating to the pending proxy contest with conmed corporation “conmed” or the “company” nasdaqcnmd in the interest of constructive compromise yesterday voce offered to withdraw its proxy solicitation if the board would appoint two of voce’s independent nominees to the board james w green the president and ceo and a director of analogic nasdaqalog and joshua h levine the president and ceo and a director of accuray nasdaqaray neither mr green nor mr levine has any ties or affiliations with voce and both are outstanding highly experienced ceos of publiclytraded medical device companies yet the board wouldn’t even respond to voce’s proposal voce notes that it has previously reduced its slate from five nominees to three to reflect the evolution of the board in recent months and to selectively address conmed’s most pressing needs as such voce believes its offer to accept the appointment of two independent directors is both reasonable and reflective of a significant compromise on voce’s part j daniel plants voce’s managing partner said “the board’s unwillingness to accept our proposal is further evidence that its ploy to appear responsive is not credible if conmed truly means what it says about avoiding a contested election and focusing exclusively on the interests of shareholders it should put aside its petty grievances with us and appoint messrs green and levine to the board” ironically despite its contrary actions the board simultaneously continues to assert that it “offered settlement negotiations to voce five months ago” which voce categorically denies – again the board has made only one proposal in july  which voce attempted to negotiate in good faith the board rejected out of hand voce’s attempt to engage with the board insisting that its initial proposal was “best and final” and “not negotiable” further the board issued an ultimatum that if voce didn’t accept it conmed would “move forward with a contested shareholder meeting” the board’s repeated references to its unrequited desire to work “constructively” with voce cannot be taken seriously in our view given the board’s prior behavior unreliable account of events and failure to accept voce’s latest settlement offer the board recently filed a presentation rife with other misleading and inaccurate information which is rebutted in a separate presentation to be filed by voce today with the sec mr plants concluded “we have made two reasonable proposals in an effort to resolve matters short of a proxy contest and the ‘new’ conmed board has now refused them both while propagating the false narrative that they wish to engage and compromise if only voce would reciprocate the board’s intransigence illustrates why further changes are still needed at conmed” voce encourages its fellow shareholders to execute and return the white proxy card in addition to messrs green and levine voce’s third nominee is j daniel plants managing partner of voce and a former investment banking executive at goldman sachs and jpmorgan about voce

all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a ‘dismal science’  but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance” – murray rothbard   “i have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts” – john locke “in times of political confusion and under an arbitrary government many will prefer to keep their capital inactive concealed and unproductive either of profit or gratification rather than run the risk of its display this latter evil is never felt under a good government” – jeanbaptiste say “there are no taxes which have not a tendency to lessen the power to accumulate all taxes must either fall on capital or revenue if they encroach on capital they must proportionably diminish that fund by whose extent the extent of the productive industry of the country must always be regulated and if they fall on revenue they must either lessen accumulation or force the contributors to save the amount of the tax by making a corresponding diminution of their former unproductive consumption of the necessaries and luxuries of life some taxes will produce these effects in a much greater degree than others but the great evil of taxation is to be found not so much in any selection of its objects as in the general amount of its effects taken collectively” –

carl menger “history does not provide any example of capital accumulation brought about by a government as far as governments invested in the construction of roads railroads and other useful public

directors of such companies however being the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own like the stewards of a rich man they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master’s honour and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it negligence and profusion therefore must always prevail more or less in the management of the affairs of such a company” – adam smith about voces

management select page presentations letters  press releases news voce seeks to maximize long term value for all fbr stockholders voce capital management llc and its affiliates “voce” along with its nominees own  shares of fbr  co nasdaq fbrc constituting approximately  of shares outstanding and making us fbr’s thirdlargest shareholder  we believe fbr’s current strategy has abandoned its strengths and is destroying shareholder value and that its edge has been dulled by failed efforts to branch off into highly competitive new markets where it lacks skills or differentiation we believe these futile efforts have decimated shareholder value and imperiled the company’s future  as a result the market currently values fbr at a discount to book value despite the fact that  of its tangible book is comprised of cash and investment securities – thereby implying little to no value for its entire operating business – and fbr is not meeting its own stated goals on nearly every important financial metric such as revenuehead revenue growth operating margins and return on equity and in each case it badly trails its peers on these measures  by our analysis fbr’s current strategy and expense structure mean that it is unlikely to ever cover its cost of capital  as a result fbr’s stock is worth less today than when current management was appointed in    ultimately we believe that fbr’s board is responsible and must be held accountable for these failings  the vast majority of the directors possess longstanding ties to the company and management that predate their board tenure and color their objectivity and independence in our view we strongly believe that fbr can be steered back to the path of true value creation under the guidance of a skilled operating team overseen by a refreshed reinvigorated board  we have extensively analyzed fbr’s operations and identified meaningful opportunities for fbr to reclaim lost ground and believe we have the right strategy to correct fbr’s course reverse its underperformance arrest its governance failings and deliver real lasting value for the company’s employees clients and investors we have therefore nominated three independent highlyqualified nominees the “nominees” for election to the board at the  annual meeting  jarl berntzen michael j mcconnell and j daniel plants  our nominees bring the right collective mix of investment banking finance strategy capital allocation corporate governance and operational experience to help lead the board through this crucial transition  they will seek to refocus fbr on its historic core industry sectors significantly reduce expenses and pursue higher margin advisory services while reasserting appropriate corporate governance and oversight at the company which we feel is
