consider that the statistics on the “do it yourself” approach are not encouraging findings by morningstar a leading mutual fund research firm compared mutual fund returns with the gains investors actually received the study found that investor returns typically lagged fund returns the reason investors tended to move cash in and out as markets would rise and fall often buying high and selling low the study covered  years through the end of  and found that funds posted an average annualized return of  compared with a  average return realized by investors the returns factor in all stock and bond funds that morningstar tracks investor returns are weighted based on asset flows into and out of all share classes of openend mutual funds tracked by morningstar although a gap of a single percentage point may not seem like a big difference it can make a significant impact over the long term thanks to compounding in fact a hypothetical  investment returning an average of  annually would produce a total of  over  years compared with  for an average annual return of  over the same period over  years the gap becomes even wider  for the  return vs  for the  return returns based on a hypothetical  initial investment what is the reason for the gap between fund returns and investor returns financial researchers say the difference is largely attributable to investors buying funds when times are good and then selling when troubles arise once out of the market investors often don’t get back in the market in time to capture much of the later upturn in stock prices stock market volatility makes the problem worse fear can drive investors out of the market or cause them to make emotional decisions that could have longterm consequences for their portfolios a financial advisor
