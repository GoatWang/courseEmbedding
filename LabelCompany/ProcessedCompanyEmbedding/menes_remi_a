capabilities and further our ability to have a transformative impact on patients suffering from debilitating rare diseases upon closing of the transaction novelion will emerge a stronger company with aegerions two marketed products global commercial operations and a more robust pipeline in addition novelion will be well funded with an unrestricted pro forma cash balance of over  million we remain fully committed to maximizing juxtapid and myalept and expect both products to continue serving as important pillars of our business while we continue to see erosion of juxtapid patients at a meaningful rate due to the availability of pcsk inhibitors we remain confident that we have a base of hofh patients for whom pcsk inhibitors will prove insufficient and for whom juxtapid will remain an important treatment we also have early encouraging signs of adult hofh patients coming back onto juxtapid therapy after being treated with a pcsk inhibitor although the numbers remain small at this time myalept remains an important growth driver for aegerion we have received positive feedback from physicians and gl patients about the importance of this therapy and are working diligently to achieve our goals of expanding into global markets and additional indications we were pleased to have recorded our first exus sales of myalept in the second quarter and look forward to continuing our
