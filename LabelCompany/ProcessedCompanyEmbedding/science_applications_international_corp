community and homeland security contracting as well as selected commercial markets as a march  vanity fair article published by the investigative journalist duo bartlett and steele put it saic sells human beings who have a particular expertiseexpertise about weapons about homeland security about surveillance about computer systems about information dominance and information warfare  what everyone agrees on is this no washington contractor pursues government money with more ingenuity and perseverance than saic  no contractor seems to exploit conflicts of interest in washington with more zeal and no contractor cloaks its operations in greater secrecy saic almost never touts its activities in public preferring to stay well below the radar global fortune  position  ownership status publicly traded number of employees worldwide  chief executive officer kenneth dahlberg website httpwwwsaiccom tel  corporate accountability environment and product safety  in  saic was charged with falsifying data submitted to the epa on soil samples from toxic waste dumps for which it ended up paying   million in fines and restitution political influence  according to investigative journalists bartlett and steele everyone agrees that no washington contractor pursues government money with more ingenuity and perseverance than saic no contractor seems to exploit conflicts of interest in washington with more zeal saics relative anonymity has allowed large numbers of its executives to circulate freely between the company and the dozen or so government agencies it cares about bartlett and steele report the company has many friends in washington including secretary of defense robert m gates a former member of saics board of directors william b black jr retired from nsa in  to join saic and returned to nsa in  black managed the trailblazer contract that was abandoned after  billion was spent donald foley a current saic director is a former top official with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the group responsible for developing new military technology mark boster a former deputy assistant attorney general joined saic in  boster paid  to settle charges he violated federal ethics rules by calling justice on behalf of the company just three months after he switched sides saic personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in iraq under saddam hussein and that war was the only way to get rid of them when no weapons of mass destruction were found saic personnel staffed the commission set up to investigate how american intelligence could have been so disastrously wrong including gordon oehler the commissions deputy director for review a year cia veteran jeffrey r cooper vice president and chief science officer for one of saics subunits and samuel visner a saic vice president for corporate development who had also passed through the revolving door and back to the nsa david kay who later chaired the iraq survey group which showed that hussein didnt possess wmd thereby proving that the war was launched under false pretenses is also an saic shareholder and former director of saics center for counterterrorism technology and analysis in  kay testified before a senate committee that saddam hussein remains in power with weapons of mass destruction and that military action is needed another saic stockholder and board member wayne downing was used as a military analyst in the buildup to the war in iraq saic also hired iraqi exiles including khidhir hamza a member of the iraqi reconstruction and development council once perceived as a conduit for iraqi exiles living in the us who would be called upon to serve in the newly established government operating under a  million contract saic organized the iraqi exiles and reported to douglas feith then undersecretary of defense for policy and a key assistant to donald rumsfeld feiths deputy christopher ryan henry is a former saic senior vice president according to bartlett and steele another saic subjectmatter expert was shaha riza whose relationship to paul wolfowitz was one of the reasons for his downfall as president of the world bank during the iraq war saic was awarded a   million nobid contract which later grew to  million to establish a free and independent indigenous media network in iraq according to bartlett and steele with saics cooperation the network quickly devolved into a mouthpiece for the pentagon  a little voice of america in addition to having many friends in high places saic also pays lobbyists from fba inc and harris wiltshire  grannis in  its lobbying expenditures topped  million the companys pac saic inc has spent hundreds of thousands so far in the  election cycle contracting incompetence and other costly errors in  saic was charged with defrauding the government over its efforts to design a flat panel display screen for fighter jets the government alleged that saic received millions of dollars but never produced a fully operational model and misled the government about the status of their progress according to media reports in december  saic settled with the government and paid a fine of  million in  that saic paid  to settle a case of voluntary disclosure costlabor mischarging on may   the department of justice announced that saic was among three government contractors that would pay a total of  to settle alleged false claims act violations in which they allegedly failed to properly test electrical cables installed at a us treasury facility under construction in fort worth texas that prints money saic was the prime contractor on the project its share of the settlement was  a  gao report gaot reported p  that saic billed the fbi twice for the same invoice as a subcontractor for the trilogy project in their march  article bartlett and steele reported that several of saics biggest projects have turned out to be colossal failures including a  million contract to build a nsa communications intercept computer system called trailblazer four years and more than a billion dollars later the effort has been abandoned  happily for saic it will get the chance for a comeback  the company has been awarded the contract for a revised trailblazer program called executelocus the contract is worth  million another failed effort involved a  million contract to upgrade the fbis computer virtual case file vcf system the fbi pulled the plug on the system in  after concluding that it would not work vcf was written off by a global publication for technology professionals as the most highly publicized software failure in history the draft senate appropriations bill for the justice department directed the department and fbi to use all means necessary to recover the funds spent on the project in testimony to congress thenfbi director mueller said an independent verification and validation review was conducted by aerospace corporation which could find no assurance that the requirements were satisfied nor that the architecture concept of operations and requirements were correct and complete saic officials explain that the scope of the project changed over time in addition there were too few fbi technicians compared with the number of saic contractors as a result the fbi could not keep up with communicating the everexpanding requirements for vcf to saic developers fbi data czar zalmai azmi blamed saic for planning what he thought was an overly ambitious allatonce transition from the old legacy automated case support system acs to the new vcf system and blamed saic for fasttracking the project to such an extent that it created silos of information that could not interconnect saic has said it was the fbis desire to fasttrack the project that contributed to vcfs collapse saic security engineer matthew patton posted an email on the infosec news mailing list wwwinfosecnewsorg in response to a senators public statements about the deplorable state of the nations information technology infrastructure pattons post was interpreted by fbi and saic management as an attempt to blow the whistle on what he saw as crippling mismanagement of a national securitycritical project he was removed from the project and eventually left saic saic failed to deliver a highly touted security system for the  athens olympics causing the greek government to refuse final payment a newspaper in athens described the system as operationally useless history science applications international corporation was created in
