lp with  million in assets under management –  million he had saved on his own and the balance he had raised from outside investors shortly after launching the hedge fund in february  bass became convinced that there was a residential realestate bubble in the united states one of the few investors to successfully predict and benefit from the subprime mortgage crisis bringing him notoriety in the financial services industry in  bass testified as an expert witness before the us house financial services subcommittee on capital markets and governmentsponsored enterprises during his testimony he addressed i the role of credit rating agencies in the structured finance market and ii policy measures that could be taken to minimize inherent conflicts of interest between rating agencies and issuers in  bass testified before the financial crisis inquiry commission during his testimony he addressed i key factors that contributed to the enormity of the crisis ii changes needed to restore the us banking system and iii how to protect taxpayers from a future crisis in his opening statement he said i believe that there is a role for leverage and for aggressive risk taking in the economy but that role should be played by firms that are open and susceptible to the risk of insolvency and failure capitalism requires failure and bankruptcy as a consequence in order to guide behavior as the old adage goes ‘capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell’ if we cannot allow a firm to go bankrupt then we should regulate its activities so that it cannot engage in the sort of risky transactions that put it at risk of bankruptcy to be clear we should not prevent all firms from taking on leverage or engaging in risky behavior we must ensure that they are not allowed to become too big to fail — j kyle bass testimony before the financial crisis inquiry commission hearing on the financial crisis hayman capitaledit subprime mortgagesedit bass first began formulating his subprime strategy after he met with an investment banker from new york while attending a wedding in spain where they discussed how and why the subprime mezzanine cdo business existed after returning to the us bass hired several private investigators to determine the ease of obtaining a mortgage bass spent a significant amount of time studying the residential mortgage market and performed research to identify which residential mortgage backed securities rmbs composed of lowquality mortgages were most likely to default this investment thesis was expressed by purchasing credit default swaps against the securitizations he deemed to be most unstable which essentially was a manner of shorting the bonds using synthetic instruments after purchasing the positions for his flagship fund in  bass raised additional capital for a special fund dedicated exclusively to capitalizing on the opportunity that existed in the market place bass managed or advised over  billion of positions in subprime rmbs in december  after a wave of foreclosures had swept across the us bass was featured on bloomberg tv as making a fortune betting against these subprime securities in april  d magazine the dallas city magazine profiled bass in an article entitled cashing in on subprime the tagline read the subprime crisis in the housing market has led to a financial crisis and fears of a recession if only someone could have predicted it someone did his name is kyle bass and he made about half a billion dollars from it  author michael lewis in his novel the big short acknowledging bass and others explained a small number of people—more than ten fewer than twenty—made a straightforward bet against the entire multitrilliondollar subprime mortgage market and by extension the global financial system in and of itself it was a remarkable fact the catastrophe was foreseeable yet only a handful noticed — michael lewis the big short inside the doomsday machine national debtedit after the subprime debt crisis occurred bass decided that it was the symptom of a more significant problem with debt examining data on europe japan and the us he concluded that high levels of government debt led to public defaults in other words he believed the financial crisis far from concluded over the next three years he said in  he warned of several potential defaults by major countries as of   of his portfolio was involved in bets against european and japanese sovereign debts he predicted that  would be a doomsday year for europe and spoke of a looming breakup of the eurozone which he declared would lead to defaults in japan and the united states he stated in june  europe goes first then japan and finally the united states in a speech reported on january   he assured the audience of his confidence that the next few years would be rife with turmoil including the eruption of major wars in his speech he claimed that with the growing debt and inability to pay it off eventually social unrest will lead to violent outbreaks bass finished his speech stating war is coming – just as it has throughout history  greeceedit on september   bass maintained on cnbc that greeces only way out of its debt mess was a restructuring bass noted that despite the strife it would bring to greece it was the only measure the nation could take he added that within a year all of europe would be in default as well japanedit for several years bass has been predicting impending financial crisis for japan describing its approach to financing debt as a ponzi scheme similar to bernie madoffs investment scam most experts have disagreed with his analysis cullen roche criticized basss japan analysis in august  noting that bass comparing japan to the eu was an error since their monetary systems are wildly different roche stated people still fail to understand that a nation with monetary sovereignty that is the supplier of currency in a floating exchange rate system never has a problem funding itself in may  business insider agreed faulting basss analysis since debttogdp ratios do not reflect the interest rate or credit risk of a nation the business insider noted that in a nation that borrows its own currency public spending finances borrowing in february  jesper koll japanese equity expert at jp morgan securities japan weighed in with what stephen harner of forbes called a highly persuasive rebuttal to bass on japan argentinaedit the bbc has described bass as having a good relationship with argentinas president cristina fernandez de kirchner in february  bass said that argentinian bonds represented a profitable opportunity and called argentina most interesting nation for investments he was virtually alone in this assessment with one observer noting the poor state of the argentine economy the ib times noted that the country had cheated creditors seven times since it gained independence from spain in  most recently defaulting on its debt in  when the argentine government defaulted on its debt in july  bass supported the move and criticized the bondholders notably elliott management and aurelius capital that with the support of us federal judge thomas griesa had held out for full payment echoing argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner he called these creditors vultures said that they were holding up  million people from progress and were holding argentina for ransom on august   bass accused elliotts paul singer of holding poor countries as hostages prompting the new york post to comment in an editorial the next day that bass had sounded more like argentinas leftist economy minister axel kicillof than a us hedgefund manager  general motorsedit in april  bass noted the new york times was among a very few defenders of general motors automobile manufacturer for its failure to address a defect that had been tied to  deaths bass whose fund at the time owned eight million shares of gm making it haymans single biggest holding said on cnbc that of the  passengers who had died owing to the defect  either weren’t wearing their seatbelt or were under the influence of alcohol  bass admitted on october   that  had been a tough year for hayman due to his gm position which remained the funds biggest position challenging drug patentsedit in  bass formed the coalition for affordable drugs cfad in order to challenge pharmaceutical patents bass used the inter partes review ipr process which was created by congress to streamline challenges to patent validity to go after drug companies that he saw as the most egregious examples of those extending their patents at the expense of medicare medicaid and american patients when he initiated this practice in january  he claimed that his motive was to encourage competition in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and thus bring down prices “this is going to lower drug prices for medicare and for everyone” he said promising that the targeted pharmaceutical firms would get “knee capped” by his challenges patent expert scott a mckeown calling bass a “patent troll” wrote in response “mr bass may be the only one about to be knee capped and rightfully so” bass filed a total of  patent challenges in collaboration with erich spangenberg who has been called “the worlds most notorious patent troll” including  filed by cfad and two filed by bass personally on a notforprofit basis the patent trial and appeal board instituted trial on  of the petitions and denied trial on  of the petitions giving bass a  institution success rate his patent challenges drew controversy from drug companies who criticized bass for trying to profit from successful challenges that may pressure a companys revenue and shares when drugs come off patent and can be sold by generic drug makers their prices plummet profit was a motive for bass but he insisted he was not alone in this as the pharmaceutical companies targeted were also focused on profit bass stated at the heart of nearly every patentthe motivation is profit bass has cautioned this system must be fixed or we will continue to pay more and more for the same old drugs we’ve been buying for decades when his main target in these patent challenges celgene corp accused him of abusing the patentreview process for his own enrichment bass replied through the cfad that “celgene is not givingits profits awayit should be axiomatic that people do not undertake socially valuable activity for free” in june  celgene received permission from the us patent and trademark office to file a motion seeking sanctions against the cfad for allegedly abusing the patentreview process the wall street journal noted that this development was “being closely watched because it raises the possibility that patent officials may put an end” to basss patentchallenge scheme celgene also told the patent office through counsel that cfad had threatened to challenge its patents unless celgene met cfad’s demands however this statement was never substantiated with any documentation during the course of the uspto ptab proceedings bass was recognized as one of the top  most influential people in the global patent market by

but that role should be played by firms that are open and susceptible to the risk of insolvency and failure capitalism requires failure and bankruptcy as a consequence in order to guide behavior as the old adage goes ‘capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell’ if we cannot allow a firm to go bankrupt then we should regulate its activities so that it cannot engage in the sort of risky transactions that put it at risk of bankruptcy to be clear we should not prevent all firms from taking on leverage or engaging in risky behavior we must ensure that they are not allowed

returning to the us bass hired several private investigators to determine the ease of obtaining a mortgage bass spent a significant amount of time studying the residential mortgage market and performed research to identify which residential mortgage backed securities rmbs composed of lowquality mortgages were most likely to default this investment thesis was expressed by purchasing credit default swaps against the securitizations he deemed to be most unstable which essentially was a manner of shorting the bonds using synthetic instruments after purchasing the positions for his flagship

investment scam most experts have disagreed with his analysis cullen roche criticized basss japan analysis in august  noting that bass comparing japan to the eu was an error since their monetary systems are wildly different roche stated people still fail to understand that a nation with monetary sovereignty that is the supplier of currency in a floating exchange rate system never has a problem funding itself in may  business insider agreed faulting basss analysis since debttogdp ratios do not reflect the interest rate or credit risk of a nation the business insider noted that in a nation that borrows its own currency public spending finances borrowing in february  jesper koll japanese equity expert at jp morgan securities japan weighed in with what stephen harner of forbes called a highly persuasive rebuttal to bass on japan argentinaedit the bbc has described bass as having a good relationship with argentinas president cristina fernandez de kirchner in february  bass said that argentinian bonds represented a profitable opportunity and called argentina most interesting nation for investments he was virtually alone in this assessment with one observer noting the poor state of the argentine economy the ib times noted that the country had cheated creditors seven times since it gained independence from spain in  most recently defaulting on its debt in  when the argentine government defaulted on its debt in july  bass supported the move and criticized the bondholders notably elliott management and aurelius capital that with the support of us federal judge thomas griesa had held out for full payment echoing argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner he called these creditors vultures said that they were holding up  million people from progress and were holding argentina for ransom on august   bass accused elliotts paul singer of holding poor countries as hostages prompting the new york post to comment in an editorial the next day that bass had sounded more like argentinas leftist economy minister axel kicillof than a us hedgefund manager  general motorsedit in april  bass noted the new york times was among a very few defenders of general motors automobile manufacturer for its failure to address a defect that had been tied to  deaths bass whose fund at the time owned eight million shares of gm making it haymans single biggest holding said on cnbc that of the  passengers who had died owing to the defect  either weren’t wearing their seatbelt or were under the influence of alcohol  bass admitted on october   that  had been a tough year for hayman due to his gm position which remained the funds biggest position challenging drug patentsedit in  bass formed the coalition for affordable drugs cfad in order to challenge pharmaceutical patents bass used the inter partes review ipr process which was created by congress to streamline challenges to patent validity to go after drug companies that he saw as the most egregious examples of those extending their patents at the expense of medicare medicaid and american patients when he initiated this practice in january  he claimed that his motive was to encourage competition in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and thus bring down prices “this is going to lower drug prices for medicare and for everyone” he said promising that the targeted pharmaceutical firms would get “knee capped” by his challenges patent expert scott a mckeown calling bass a “patent troll” wrote in response “mr bass may be the only one about to be knee capped and rightfully so” bass filed a total of  patent challenges in collaboration with erich spangenberg who has been called “the worlds most notorious patent troll” including  filed by cfad and two filed by bass personally on a notforprofit basis the patent trial and appeal board instituted trial on  of the petitions and denied trial on  of the petitions giving bass a  institution success rate his patent challenges drew controversy from drug companies who criticized bass for trying to profit from successful challenges that may pressure a companys revenue and shares when drugs come off patent and can be sold by generic drug makers their prices plummet profit was a motive for bass but he insisted he was not alone in this as the pharmaceutical companies targeted were also focused on profit bass stated at the heart of nearly every patentthe motivation is profit bass has cautioned this system must be fixed or we will continue to pay more and more for the same old drugs we’ve been buying for decades when his main target in these patent challenges celgene corp accused him of abusing the patentreview process for his own enrichment bass replied through the cfad that “celgene is not givingits profits awayit should be axiomatic that people do not undertake socially valuable activity for free” in june  celgene received permission from the us patent and trademark office to file a motion seeking sanctions against the cfad for allegedly abusing the patentreview process the wall street journal noted that this development was “being closely watched because it raises the possibility that patent officials may put an end” to basss patentchallenge scheme celgene also told the patent office through counsel that cfad had threatened to challenge its patents unless celgene met cfad’s demands however this statement was never substantiated with any documentation during the course of the uspto ptab proceedings bass was recognized as one of the top  most influential people in the global patent market by
