produce results that differ from when those estimates were made significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to material change within the near term relate to the determination of allowance for loan losses determination of otherthantemporary impairment of investment securities fair value of financial instruments the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or satisfaction of loans the valuation of deferred tax assets the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations and the impairment of goodwill actual amounts could differ from those estimates  table of contents we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we believe adequate to absorb probable credit losses related to individually evaluated loans as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date the balance in the allowance for loan losses account is based on past events and current economic conditions the allowance for loan losses account consists of an allocated element and an unallocated element the allocated element consists of a specific portion for the impairment of loans individually evaluated and a formula portion for loss contingencies on those loans collectively evaluated the unallocated element if any is used to cover inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date but which have not been identified as part of the allocated allowance using our impairment evaluation methodology due to limitations in the process we monitor the adequacy of the allocated portion of the allowance quarterly and adjust the allowance as necessary through normal operations this ongoing evaluation reduces potential differences between estimates and actual observed losses the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available accordingly management cannot ensure that chargeoffs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required resulting in an adverse impact on operating results in determining the requirement to record an otherthantemporary impairment on securities owned by us four main characteristics are considered including fair values of financial instruments in cases where quoted market prices are not available are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques which are subject to change real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans is adjusted to fair value based upon current estimates derived through independent appraisals less cost to sell however proceeds realized from sales may ultimately be higher or lower than those estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities the amount of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary to the amount that based on available evidence will more likely than not be realized as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes the acquired assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date in many cases determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the company to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest which required the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition goodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if conditions indicate potential impairment exist any impairment losses arising from such testing are reported in the income statement in the current period as a separate line item
