original of  plaster statuette height  inches length of base  inches depth from front of base  inches salmon coloration rogers could neither sketch nor paint but was a master model maker who could make anything that could be conceptualized in three dimensions he produced twelve war groups with this being one of his most popular there are photographs of both rogers himself and george armstrong custer each next to this particular sculpture a neighbor of rogers posed for the standing soldier wearing the uniform in which he had fought during the war it was originally commissioned for a monument that was never produced the alva company is now out of business and this sculpture is hardly found today having been out of production for many years excellent clean with no chipping rogers groups were originally modeled in clay by rogers himself then cast in bronze  from the bronze molds were made for the groups in plaster  then painted usually tan putty color but sometimes darker brown or lighter gray  rogers’ marketing material encourages buyers to paint the groups to accommodate the buyer’s own taste and decorating style so they are often seen in a variety of colors in a manner of

on the subjects of everyday life the theatre shakespeare the civil war and horses at a time when it was in vogue to have parlor statuary in one’s home rogers provided appealing high quality durable plaster statuary which was well within the financial reach of many for whom marble or bronze statuary was not “rogers’ groups” were a staple in many households in the th century he was mostly

rogers inc was founded in  by first generation owner john rogers who began selling local produce out of the fertile valley in great meadows nj he famously tells the story of driving his ford model t to the washington street market in nyc to deliver a load of produce and not passing a single car on his mile trip back how times have changed today now  years later our company is still family owned and operated headed by john’s son thomas and his son david the company has adapted to changing times we work with a variety of businesses – from large chain stores to restaurants and family farm markets – and we take pride in selling farm fresh produce to our customers over the span of our existence we’ve expanded our goods to include seafood of all types including shellfish frozen fish and fresh fish to order the strength of our business is built upon the relationships we maintain both with our employees and our customers we take pride in honest business friendly service and quality products our fruit selection along with all of our other products varies based on what’s delicious and in season  imagine a winter filled with lusciously sweet seedless naval oranges and juicy tangelos leading you to a spring blossoming abundantly with local flair  in the early spring we thoroughly enjoy the unfortunately short nj strawberry season and rhubarb kicking off our need for sweets and tarts in the warm ease of spring  our local fruit blossoms into peaches watermelons nectarines all the while we follow the california and washington seasons through their delicious cherry plum grape and other delectable fruits  give us a call to see what’s ringing our tastebuds this season when it comes to vegetables we are in a league of our own  when john rogers started our company in the late ’s with a model t and strong local farming community his vision led us down the path we continue to follow today  our community of local farmers continues to grow and we lean on local for as much wonderful fresh produce as is in season  as with every good thing when the local season ends in the late fall months we move our supply to include fresh produce from sea to shining sea  once you’ve tried our various local lettuce in the summer you’ll never open a bag to make a salad again  start your spring in the right direction with some world famous nj asparagus then enjoy all those wonderful eggplant tomatoes broccoli carrots and everything that brings us into the brussels sprouts that are the tail end of the local crop  of course when our local farmers hang their hats for the season we count on the bountiful west coast and southeast to fill the gap throughout the winter imagine fish from the coast of nj ny and new england fresh and in season – sound delicious  it is  we take pride in sourcing the freshest clams oysters and fresh fish all year long and keeping our customers fed with the best there is to offer  we’ve always taken pride in offering options for customers to enjoy fresh  of course for those interested in enormous alaskan king crab legs canadian lobster tails and shrimp from the biggest to the smallest we try to have a little something for everyone  give us a call today to order some fish fresher than you’ll get anywhere else a pequest rd oxford nj   we’re located off route  behind villa venice in great meadows nj give us a call for immediate

skinlike microfluidic systems for capture storage and chemical analysis of sweatsoft flexible and stretchable microfluidic systems including embodiments that integrate wireless communication electronics can intimately and robustly bond to the surface of skin without chemical or mechanical irritation this integration defines an access point for a small set of sweat glands such that perspiration spontaneously initiates routing of sweat through a microfluidic network and set of reservoirs embedded chemical reagents respond in colorimetric fashion to markers such as chloride and

electron micrographs of d structures formed by a mechanically directed selfassembly process in which thin materials patterned in d by semiconductor manufacturing techniques spontaneously rise up out of the plane to yield d architectures with engineering control the resulting capabilities far exceed anything that is possible with traditional d printing techniques d microarchitectures in devicegrade siliconcolorized scanning electron micrograph of a complex threedimensional structure formed by transformation of a planar twodimensional precursor controlled buckling follows from compressive forces that act at precise locations across the structure upon release of prestrain in an elastomeric substrate this example uses microscale ribbons and plates of silicon with potential applications in electronic circuits battery anodes photodetectors and other semiconductor devices a digital camera with a design inspired by the insect eyein arthropods evolution has created a remarkably sophisticated class of imaging system with wide angle field of view low aberrations high acuity to motion and infinite depth of field we demonstrated materials and fabrication schemes for arthropodinspired cameras with numbers of imaging elements comparable to those found in the eyes fire ants and bark beetles the devices combine elastomeric compound optics with deformable arrays of thin silicon photodetectors in cointegrated sheets that can be blown up like a balloon soft microfluidic assemblies of circuits sensors and radios for the skinchipscale components contained in thin elastomeric microfluidic structures and interconnected with origami type wiring networks yield stretchable wireless systems that can gently but robustly integrate with the surface of the skin for
