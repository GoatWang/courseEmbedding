leave a reply this summer i’ve noticed a shift in my consumption of entertainment with longer days at hand alongside some vacation time i’ve enjoyed exploring the entertainment options available to me largely media delivered through my laptop or my ipad didn’t everyone used to plop down on the couch with one person wielding the remote control bringing up the cable menu and debating about what to watch nowadays in my family’s house our tv is rarely on with the exceptions being warriors games the super bowl and the oscars instead sometimes we sit on the couch next to each other with each of us watching programming of our choosing on our own devices sometimes my husband will be watching one miniseries while i stream another it feels as though we each have our own channels with our own preferences i’m wondering does anyone rely on traditional “programming” anymore the whole notion of watching tv together has changed the differentiation of everything is possible now and a lot of the programming delivered is handled in such a way that content is king no one binge watches movies which are a complete experience in  hours instead we have the ongoing experience of lengthy seasons of shows ranging from politics like house of cards to history like the tudors to fantasy like game of thrones that we can watch and rewatch from the convenience of our devices the experience of watching the latest season is akin to the hype that builds for a new movie but it’s not just a onetime experience it repeats week after week until the season is complete if you’re like me you bingewatch more on weekends or vacation time at your own convenience no longer beholden to a specific viewing time or place or to dvrs which i believe will soon become as obsolete as vhs and even dvd players we want our leisure viewing to be delivered ondemand when it’s convenient and desirable for us and entertainment providers have delivered to me this shift in entertainment consumption in favor of our comfort and convenience is akin to the shift i see in the workforce in favor of the same increasingly mobile flexible workforces seek to maximize their workday alongside maximizing their flexibility  for the rest of their life or lifestyle including leisure time pursuits like watching the latest miniseries flexibility is the wave of the st century and i believe we’ll be seeing more and more entertainment trends catering to our desire to have what we want to watch or to play at our fingertips when we’re ready wherever we are  wrapup leave a reply since posting this summer reading list in august i’ve

entrepreneurship and more best wishes for a healthy and happy holiday season summer reading recent publications leave a reply it’s hard to believe that summer is winding down many of you are prepping for backtoschool as others are gearing up for one last vacation before hitting the ground running this fall it’s been a while since i updated my recent publications and especially because some of these might be relevant to your autumn plans i cobbled together this reading list for your poolside perusal enjoy for your inspiration more women of inspiration passion and purpose at the forbes women’s summit helpful advice four considerations when plotting a career move five ways to get your ideas heard if i were  five things i’d do with hindsight four filters for choosing cofounders ideas

unconscious bias in hiring three characteristics of a great team food for thought your iphone as a matter of national security imagining iot in  collaboration is the new communication voice interfaces are the next big thing silicon valley is the next hollywood  resolutions to restore body  soul   silicon valley is the next hollywood leave a reply   recently i’ve been enjoying a lot of interesting conversations with my son who works in hollywood about the future of our entertainment consumption and creation when i was a child in preglastnost ukraine families would gather in the common area to listen to a radio show or to watch our one black  white tv nowadays we ingest podcasts and tv shows ondemand from wherever we are more and more folks don’t even have a tv at home anymore and instead are streaming programming on mobile devices and laptops hollywood may still make our movies but bay area companies are holding the keys to how that entertainment reaches us as this forbes article points out silicon valley isn’t only leading pop culture but is also creating it we listen to pandora oakland stream original netflix los gatos discover new stars on youtube san bruno and read news on facebook menlo park while the recent oscars aired folks globally took to twitter san francisco to share momenttomoment reactions original netflix series like house of cards or orange is the new black can’t be accessed through a normal cable box these series are winning awards and accolades just the same as shows on traditional networks but there’s nothing traditional about them as their whole financial model differs these shows aren’t sponsored by commercial advertisers in the same way as most cable shows are while they may still have some sponsored product placement and so forth we’re not interrupted every ten minutes for commercials — and we’re willing to pay netflix for that luxury that’s where silicon valley has really taken on hollywood in the paytoplay realm we want our content when we want it and we don’t want it to be interrupted if we subscribe to apple music cupertino we can stomach commercials or pay to opt out the same is true of spotify swedish with offices in san francisco  we sign into accounts on these service providers from our mobile phones ipads laptops video gaming systems tvs and more we want our entertainment delivered to us at our convenience instead of chaining us to our living rooms much like the workplace is getting more flexible and mobile so too  is our recreation to our great benefit hollywood theaterquality pictures are possible even on the tiniest of mobile screens underneath this interplay between the oldschool glamour of hollywood and the fastpaced advances of silicon valley is a tension that may not be so evident to those simply eager to be entertained at their leisure though content distribution is a sore spot and the stop online piracy act a bill backed by the motion picture association died only because of intervention from silicon valley google in mountain view among them proponents of the legislation claimed they seek to protect intellectual property while opponents cited the danger to innovation that the bill posed the bill which failed went so far as to enable law enforcement to take down an entire website like all of facebook if a single user like you or me posted something illegally on our page hollywood has legitimate concerns but technology fortunately was not made to grind to a halt while addressing them — at least not yet as the valley continues to innovate i don’t doubt the subject of that thin line between protection and distribution will continue to be the center of much debate is silicon valley the next hollywood with all of the innovation mentioned above alongside advanced animation giant pixar emeryville once owned by steve jobs and lucasfilm marin both now owned by disney there’s a case to be made that not only silicon valley but the greater bay area has supplanted greater los angeles as the world’s leading maker and purveyor of entertainment certainly hollywood couldn’t continue to thrive without silicon valley beyond the incredible movies made here many more innovations that will make our downtime all the more accessible and enjoyable from wherever we are and whenever we want it are afoot i find this to be one of the most entertaining things to watch  resolutions to restore body  soul in  leave a reply   when i consider resolutions for a new year i first reflect on the past year this helps me to sketch out what to prioritize in the year ahead based on a challenging past year as i look ahead to  a lot of my resolutions are personal for example having lost my father last summer it is a high priority for me to organize my memories well in the coming year my family has lots of printed photos that i’d like to digitize and i also plan to organize photo albums this is a huge undertaking and one that is difficult to complete because it’s so timeconsuming it’s also pretty wonderful though going through these photos is going down memory lane and it give me special opportunities to stop and remember important things it’s especially fun to reflect with my family when we can do this together in addition to organizing my memories i’ll also be reorganizing my home office and closet space this coming year i’m no hoarder but i’ve come to recognize that i have a lot of things in my way that i put in my office thinking that i’d use but haven’t perhaps someone else can put these items to better use so i plan to donate as much as i can less clutter occupying important work space and getting in the way of things i really need to access will make working in my home office more enjoyable like many people i also have some health goals for  in ringcentral’s new office space we have a great cafeteria and we also have an amazing supply of snacks i aim to snack less in the office just because there are treats around doesn’t mean i have to eat them i really have to learn to avoid snacks when i’m stressed especially maybe i’ll have an apple instead in the new year i also seek to multitask less we’ve become too accustomed to doing multiple things at the same time and we all suffer for it we think that we can read email while we talk on the phone peek at texts while in conversation with others or check our facebook or linkedin feeds while in a meeting — but when we do these things one of the tasks at hand is getting less of our attention and none of them are getting enough of it to bring my best self to each interaction and give each task the attention that it’s due is an important goal for me in  lastly i always like to set a learning goal for myself in a new year this year i have decided to learn a new skill but i’m still deciding on the particulars i look forward to broadening my horizons through learning new things this new year and every year in sum being more organized healthy and focused as well as learning a new skill are my new year’s resolutions for  perhaps we can check in midyear to see how these things are going if you set resolutions like i do i’d love to hear both what they are and how you manage to stay atop them so that you meet these goals as the year progresses all my best wishes for a happy  – kira this week on real time communications the future of collaboration leave a reply   this week on real time communications i wrote an article on the future of collaboration the collaboration software sector is heating up as the universe of unified communications and collaborations ucc products expands just as the way we work has morphed because of the internet so too has unified communications evolved for example augmenting telephony with chat software makes for more efficient communication and that can make a tremendous difference in the way we do business at today’s lightning speed the way we work always will be growing and changing and the future of collaboration software will become yet more featurerich in support of that for more of my thoughts on the future of collaboration please click here to read my article my experience as a refugee in america leave a reply   with today’s news reports of violence terror and refugee crises it feels more important than ever this holiday seaseon to take a moment as americans and consider the freedom we have to live good lives while i’ve written before about my immigration like my tale of my first american summer camp experience i haven’t addressed what it was like for my family of refugees to land in america this is that story when my family left odessa ukraine in the lates we emigrated because of discrimination against and persecution of jews like us we were unable to practice our religion or any religion in the soviet union part of what drove us to america was freedom of religion also in general my parents wanted a chance at a better life we arrived in the united states with family already here including my mother’s brother my uncle and my mother’s parents my grandparents so we weren’t entirely alone family helped where it could and when we were in greater need jewish family  children’s services stepped in to help like by sending me to camp tawonga this was the experience of many russian jews who were refugees in america private service agencies helped a lot much more so than the government it was very rare to find any of us reliant on governmental help my parents found success here in america in russia my father was an engineer who designed toys while my mother taught russian language and literature and worked as a librarian here in the us my father retrained as an electrical engineer and worked for a hardware manufacturing company and my mother became an accountant working in personnel for seagrams they both felt lucky that in this country being a refugee wasn’t a barrier to success they had opportunity in fact in my community it seemed like the success rate was really high our parents and then me and my peers had an intense drive to succeed in our new country as a child i watched my parents work hard to establish our new lives here just as i worked hard to figure out how to fit into this new culture and place it felt like drinking from a fire hose every day even though my family wasn’t particularly disadvantaged in russia we had still come from a poor country in america we were surrounded by excess in a way that we couldn’t have dreamed so many things were mindboggling like the abundance of food at the supermarkets and all of the things for sale all over the place we had so many struggles to fit into the culture at all to learn the ways of america plus a language barrier without mastery of the english language especially we were truly handicapped at first here for a long time i was afraid to raise my hand in class because i was afraid of how my words would come out but i soon realized that the us had true diversity it felt like nobody was born here and that there were immigrants from everywhere especially in the jewish community where it feels like we were all only one or two generations away from somebody’s parents or grandparents being fresh off of the boat in odessa people rarely moved from place to place but here people are more mobile even among cultures we had a saying in russia that you were born speaking russian and you died speaking russian but here it felt like you could be born in one culture and become another it was okay to be different in the us but not in odessa where conformity was the norm it took a while for me to realize that the reason they call the us a “melting pot” is that you can be anyone here that it doesn’t matter if you are born into money or not or if your parents do or do not have connections in russia you had to have your parents’ connections to succeed at all here networking helps with business success but it’s rarely if at all familydriven and of course part of the reason we came – freedom to practice our jewish religion – became part of our lives and joy this is where i want to end my story because on today’s news the perception is that religion is polarizing and devastating nations that this is untrue in the united states is is one of the things for which i am most thankful my family did not have religious freedom at all in the soviet union as polarizing as religion can seem here at times let us never lose sight that we have the freedom to practice our faith whatever it is as well as the opportunity to create new successful lives there is no doubt that my family’s lives are far better than they would have been had we stayed in the ukraine this holiday season and always i am grateful that my family had that opportunity postscript there are important distinctions between my family’s experience as refugees and that of today’s syrians my family experienced no violence or anything close to what syrians are experiencing in their civil war the experience of today’s syrians is a lot more like jews’ experience in world war ii it is a humanitarian crisis that was not my experience i don’t write this piece in an attempt to speak for all refugees or even to enter a political dialogue as sensitive as i am to the plight of refugees i write this piece to put a human face on one story one experience – my own – in a time when we are considering what it means to be a refugee in america  in memory of my father roman makagon who passed away on august    search for recent posts how do you entertain yourself  wrapup summer reading recent publications silicon valley is

meta log in entries rss comments rss wordpressorg being a gender neutral leader  kira makagon kira makagon serial entrepreneur innovative leader being a gender neutral leader leave a reply not long ago i shared insight about the value of creating a gender neutral organization and how to do so in your business as part i referenced that a large part of this relies at the toplevel led first by example but also through effort and tactics it beings with the leader and means adopting a leadership style that does not view staff by gender but by talent experience and value in a business world where ‘male’ and ‘female’ have had clear defined lines — and the fact that there are can be differences in how men and women do business — it may not feel natural or instinctive to remove gender from the picture but in doing so leaders hold not just a great potential to better manage and drive companies overall but unlock a great benefit to the business that both men and women bring to the job here’s how to adopt a more gender neutral leadership style in your organization recognize talent first — talent and skills are something that everyone regardless of gender possess view your entire organization and everyone from this vantage point first it might take extra or careful thought but the value in doing so is more than worth it watch and evaluate how every person operates in your business and get to know each at this level first ignore your own gender — gender neutral doesn’t just mean how you see and treat others it’s also in how you see yourself and interact it doesn’t mean you’ve got to start adopting the ways or activities of the opposite sex rather operate and lead with your own talent first by making your own gender second you’ll increase your chances of acting and reacting gender neutral among your teams and staff — and show them how to do so as well be prepared — gender neutral leadership doesn’t mean you won’t have instances where gender is a factor men and women by design have different ways of handling things communicating or expressing emotion etc — and that goes for leaders as well get clear on how you want to handle any issues that arise including giving yourself time to determine course of action if needed should any situations with teams and staff happen share thislinkedintwitterfacebookemail leave a reply cancel reply your email address will

in russia my father was an engineer who designed toys while my mother taught russian language and literature and worked as a librarian here in the us my father retrained as an electrical engineer and worked for a hardware manufacturing company and my mother became an accountant working in personnel for seagrams they both felt lucky that in this country being a refugee wasn’t a barrier to success they had opportunity in fact in my community it seemed like the success rate was really high our parents and then me and my peers had an intense drive to succeed in our new country as a child i watched my parents work hard to establish our new lives here just as i worked hard to figure out how to fit into this new culture and place it felt like drinking from a fire hose every day even though my family wasn’t particularly disadvantaged in russia we had still come from a poor country in america we were surrounded by excess in a way that we couldn’t have dreamed so many things were mindboggling like the abundance of food at the supermarkets and all of the things for sale all over the place we had so many struggles to fit into the culture at all to learn the ways of america plus a language barrier without mastery of the english language especially we were truly handicapped at first here for a long time i was afraid to raise my hand in class because i was afraid of how my words would come out but i soon realized that the us had true diversity it felt like nobody was born here and that there were immigrants from everywhere especially in the jewish community where it feels like we were all only one or two generations away from somebody’s parents or grandparents being fresh off of the boat in odessa people rarely moved from place to place but here people are more mobile even among cultures we had a saying in russia that you were born speaking russian and you died speaking russian but here it felt like you could be born in one culture and become another it was okay to be different in the us but not in odessa where conformity was the norm it took a while for me to realize that the reason they call the us a “melting pot” is that you can be anyone here that it doesn’t matter if you are born into money or not or if your parents do or do not have connections in russia you had to have your parents’ connections to succeed at all here networking helps with business success but it’s rarely if at all familydriven and of course part of the reason we came – freedom to practice our jewish religion – became part of our lives and joy this is where i want to end my story because on today’s news the perception is that religion is polarizing and devastating nations that this is untrue in the united states is is one of the things for which i am most thankful my family did not have religious freedom at all in the soviet union as polarizing as religion can seem here at times let us never lose sight that we have the freedom to practice our faith whatever it is as well as the opportunity to create new successful lives there is no doubt that my family’s lives are far better than they would have been had we stayed in the ukraine this holiday season and always i am grateful that my family had that opportunity postscript there are important distinctions between my family’s experience as refugees and that of today’s syrians my family experienced no violence or anything close to what syrians are experiencing in their civil war the experience of today’s syrians is a lot more like jews’ experience in world war ii it is a humanitarian crisis that was not my experience i don’t write this piece in an attempt to speak for all refugees or even to enter a political dialogue as sensitive as i am to the plight of refugees i write this piece to put a human face on one story one experience – my own – in a time when we are considering what it means to be a refugee in america  in memory of my father roman makagon who passed away on august    search
