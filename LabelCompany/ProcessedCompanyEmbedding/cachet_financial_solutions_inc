of business we are a technology solutions and services provider to the financial services industry our solutions and services enable our clientsbanks credit unions and alternative financial services

of those agreements were active as of december   meaning that the customer has implemented the rdc or prepaid mobile money technology enabling the processing of customer transactions based on current industry trends which indicate rapid adoption of rdc and prepaid mobile money technologies and growing demand by consumers we believe we will continue to be successful in signing up additional customers at a similar rate in the future as more and more of our customers golive and consumer adoption of our cloudbased saas rdc technology increases we believe we will experience an overall increase to our revenues as a portion of our revenue is generated on a per transaction fee basis while we expect our revenues to continue to increase revenues from transaction volume has not yet grown

assistance with integration of the companys services with the customers applications dedicated support and advisory services to customers who choose to develop their own interfaces and applications

software recurring revenue is expected to include fixed monthly service charges to customers for our service transactional fees for the number items processed or a combination of both we believe that this model of recurring revenue will have a positive impact on our cash flow and valuation reliance on recurring revenues will mean however that transactional volume will likely be a key metric for

until december   when certain debts mature revenue recognition the company generates revenue from the following sources  subscription and support fees  transaction volume fees  active monthly user fees for mobile wallet offering  fees related to the implementation of rdc and mobile wallet software for clients and  professional services such as client specific software customization and other products and services the companys arrangements do not contain general rights of return the companys subscription arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the saas technology platform and as a result are accounted for as service arrangements the company records revenue net of any sales or excise taxes the company commences revenue recognition for its saas technology platform and professional services when all of the following criteria are met  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been or is being provided to the customer  collection of the fees is reasonably assured and  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable subscription and support revenue subscription and support revenue is primarily derived from customers accessing the saas technology platform and includes subscription support transaction volume fees and active user fees for mobile wallet offering subscription and support revenue is recognized ratably over the contracted term of each respective subscription agreement commencing on the date the service is provisioned to the customer provided the four revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied transaction volume fees are recognized as transactions are processed and monthly services performed and active user fees for mobile wallet offering revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as earned provided the four revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied professional services and other revenue professional services include implementation services development of interfaces requested by customers assistance with integration of the companys services with the customers applications dedicated support and advisory services to customers who choose to develop their own interfaces and applications professional services are typically performed within three to six months of entering into an arrangement with the customer professional services are typically sold on a fixedfee basis but are offered on a timeandmaterial basis as well revenue for timeandmaterial arrangements is recognized as the services are performed revenue for professional services is recognized under a percent of completion method matching the revenue with the costs of the computer programmers time the company uses internal milestones to estimate the costs and related percent of completion professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of the saas offering implementation fees the implementation fees are recognized over the term of the contract or expected life of the contract where no contractual term exists generally client agreements are entered into for  to  months a majority of the implementation service component of the arrangement with customers is performed within  days of entering into a contract with the customer multiple element arrangements the company enters into multiple element arrangements in which a customer may purchase a subscription and professional services for arrangements with multiple deliverables the company evaluates whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting in order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery the company accounts for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered if one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery the deliverables that do not have standalone value are combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting subscription and support contracts have standalone value as the company sells subscriptions and support separately in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support services the company considers the availability of the professional services from other vendors the nature of its professional services and whether the company sells its applications to new customers without professional services based on these considerations the company assessed that its professional services have standalone value the company determines the selling price for each element based on the selling price hierarchy of i vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value ii thirdparty evidence tpe and iii estimated selling price esp the company is unable to establish vsoe for any of its services as the company has not historically priced its services with sufficient consistency the company is also unable to establish tpe as the company does not have sufficient information regarding pricing of thirdparty subscription and professional services similar to its offerings as a result the company has developed estimates of selling prices based on margins established by senior management as the targets in the companys selling and pricing strategies after considering the nature of the services the economic and competitive environment and the nature and magnitude of the costs incurred the amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenue if any deferred revenue deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the companys subscription and support offerings as described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met for subscription agreements the company typically invoices its customers in monthly or annual fixed installments accordingly the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of these multiyear subscription agreements deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees which are recognized in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy the portion of deferred revenue the company expects to recognize during the succeeding month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting the companys cloudbased application providing customer support data communications expense salaries and benefits of operations and support personnel software development fees software license fees amortization expense associated with acquired developed technology assets and property and equipment depreciation accounts receivable accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customers financial condition credit history and current economic conditions accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  and  as of december   and  respectively concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the companys customer base thus spreading the credit risk goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the appraised value of the portion of identifiable assets that were acquired from the devicefidelity inc acquisition completed in march  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment or between annual dates if circumstances change that would more likely than not cause impairment management performs its annual impairment test at the close of each fiscal year and considers several factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment including the companys current financial position and results general economic and industry conditions and legal and regulatory conditions no impairment of goodwill was identified for the years ended december   and  see note  for further discussion impairment of longlived assets including license agreements the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets in december  the company determined that an impairment of  had occurred on its finitelived intangible assets related to certain customer contracts acquired in the acquisition of the select mobile money business on march   in determining the impairment loss the company reviewed all circumstances including the undiscounted cash flows it expects to derive from those contracts going forward deferred financing costs deferred financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related debt agreements the costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method in the event debt is converted or paid prior to maturity any unamortized issuance costs are charged to expense deferred commissions the company capitalizes commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer contracts commission costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer contract net loss per common share basic and diluted net loss per common share for all periods presented is computed by dividing the net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding and common stock equivalents when dilutive potentially dilutive common stock equivalents include common shares issuable pursuant to stock warrants stock options convertible preferred stock and convertible note agreements common stock equivalents were not included in determining the fully diluted loss per share as they were antidilutive fair value of financial instruments the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures warrants issued with price protection features are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments with respect to determination of fair values of financial instruments there are the following three levels of inputs  level  inputsquoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level  inputsquoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable  level  inputsinstruments with primarily unobservable value drivers the warrants that are carried at fair value are valued using level  inputs utilizing a blackscholes option pricing model under probability weighted estimated outcomes use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect certain reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates include the companys ability to continue as a going concern allowance for doubtful accounts assumptions used to value stock options and warrants conversion incentive and share purchase price adjustment and the value of shares of common stock issued for services stockbased compensation the company accounts for stockbased compensation using the estimated fair values of warrants and stock options for purposes of determining the estimated fair values the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model for the periods prior to the companys common stock being traded the company estimated the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the volatility of comparable peer companies which are publicly traded for later periods the company includes its actual common stock trading to compute volatility the company determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards giving consideration to the contractual terms vesting schedules and postvesting forfeitures the company uses the riskfree interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award the company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards is recognized using the straightline amortization method over the vesting period the fair values of stock award grants are determined based on the number of shares granted and estimated fair value of the companys common stock on the date of grant research and development costs the company considers those costs incurred in developing new processes and solutions to be research and development costs and they are expensed as incurred results of operations years ended december   and  revenues revenues for the year ended december   increased  or  to  when compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to an overall increase in rdc transactions processed which totaled  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or  from the prior year the increase was attributable to an overall increase in the number of banks and credit unions which were active customers meaning that they have implemented the products and service enabling the processing of customer transactions as of december   we had entered into  contracts signed for a total of  total products of which  of those products were active meaning that they have implemented the products and services enabling the processing of customer transactions this compares to a total of  signed contracts of which  were active as of december   in addition we generated approximately  of revenue for the year ended december   for professional services as compared to approximately  for the year ended december   during the year ended december   approximately  of our revenue was generated from transactional volume fees monthly active user fees and other recurring support services approximately  represents revenue from professional services primarily related to integration development work performed as part of implementing our mobile money product offering while the remaining  was from implementation fees that are recognized over the lives of our contracts with financial institutions the growth in  is equally spread across the product offering of implementation recurring support services and professional services as the percent of total sales remained relatively consistent between years as more clients have implemented our saas cloud based technologies they are starting to process more significant transactional and monthly active user fees and therefore we anticipate the mix of revenues will shift towards a higher percentage that are recurring in nature versus onetime implementation fees since
