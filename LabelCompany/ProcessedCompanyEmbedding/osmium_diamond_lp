oxidation states are    and  the  oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridiums  and is encountered only in xenon ruthenium hassium and iridium the oxidation states − and − represented by the two reactive compounds na os co  and na osco  are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds the most common compound exhibiting the  oxidation state is osmium tetroxide this toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air it is a very volatile watersoluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide osmium tetroxide forms red osmates oso oh−  upon reaction with a base with ammonia it forms the nitridoosmates oso n− osmium tetroxide boils at  °c and is a powerful oxidizing agent by contrast osmium dioxide oso is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic only two osmium compounds have major applications osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis and the nonvolatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions osmium pentafluoride osf is known but osmium trifluoride osf has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state  is known only for osmium iodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co  represent oxidation state  in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σdonors such as amines and πacceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ and πdonors such as o− and n− despite

approximately   times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes but it has been observed only

and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rheniumosmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rheniumrich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous–paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs  million

the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the chocó department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in  chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor colletdescotils antoine françois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium the black platinum residue in  but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists antoinefrançois fourcroy and nicolaslouis vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’ in  smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene from the greek word πτηνος ptènos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis–osoho− by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june   uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in  cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrenceedit native platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals although osmium is one of the evennumbered elements which puts it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space osmium is the least abundant stable element in earths crust with an average mass fraction of  parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium–osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides ie ptpds tellurides eg ptbite antimonides eg pdsb and arsenides eg ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earths crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper–nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by precolumbian people in the chocó department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined productionedit osmium crystals grown by chemical vapor transport osmium is obtained commercially as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with nonmetallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction in order to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing watersoluble ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo  is separated from oso  by precipitation of nhrucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide the first method is similar to the procedure used by tennant and wollaston both methods are suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium estimations of the united states consumption date published from  which gives a consumption in the united states of  troy ounces  kg would suggest that the production is still less than  ton per year in  the estimated us production of osmium was  kg applicationsedit because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals those alloys are utilized in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinumgroup metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late  rpm and early lp and  record era circa  to  although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points osmiumalloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electrondense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials have otherwise very weak tem contrast see image another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless won the nobel prize in chemistry in  oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in  an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in  after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in  when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metalhydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at  å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in spacebased uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmiumcoated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of longterm side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible although this depends on the osmium compound administered in  osmiumvi and osmiumii compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs electron micrograph of organic plant tissue without top and with bottom oso staining the sharpless dihydroxylation rl  largest substituent rm  mediumsized substituent rs  smallest substituent postflight appearance of os ag and au mirrors from the front left images and rear panels of the space shuttle blackening reveals oxidation due to irradiation by oxygen atoms precautionsedit finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric and reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil priceedit osmium is usually sold as a minimum  pure powder like other precious metals it is measured by troy weight and by grams its price in  was about  per troy ounce or about  per kilogram depending on the quantity and its supplier

powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium estimations of the united states consumption date published from  which gives a consumption in the united states of  troy ounces  kg would suggest that the production is still less than  ton per year in  the estimated us production of osmium was  kg applicationsedit because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals those alloys are utilized in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinumgroup metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late  rpm and early lp and  record era circa  to  although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points osmiumalloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electrondense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials have otherwise very weak tem contrast see image another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless won the nobel prize in chemistry in  oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in  an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in  after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in  when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metalhydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at  å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in spacebased uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmiumcoated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of longterm side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible although this depends on the osmium compound administered in  osmiumvi and osmiumii compounds were reported to show

osmium tetroxide some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil priceedit osmium is usually sold as a

has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state  is known only for osmium iodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co  represent oxidation state  in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σdonors such as amines and πacceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ and πdonors such as o− and n− despite

approximately   times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes but it has been observed only

and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rheniumosmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rheniumrich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous–paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs  million years ago historyedit osmium was discovered in  by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england the discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the chocó department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in  chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor colletdescotils antoine françois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium the black platinum residue in  but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists antoinefrançois fourcroy and nicolaslouis vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’ in  smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene from the greek word πτηνος ptènos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis–osoho− by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june   uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in  cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrenceedit native platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals although osmium is one of the evennumbered elements which puts it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space osmium is the least abundant stable element in earths crust with an average mass fraction of  parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium–osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides ie ptpds tellurides eg ptbite antimonides eg pdsb and arsenides eg ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earths crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper–nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by precolumbian people in the chocó department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined productionedit osmium crystals grown by chemical vapor transport osmium is obtained commercially as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with nonmetallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction in order to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing watersoluble ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo  is separated from oso  by precipitation of nhrucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved

oxidation states are    and  the  oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridiums  and is encountered only in xenon ruthenium hassium and iridium the oxidation states − and − represented by the two reactive compounds na os co  and na osco  are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds the most common compound exhibiting the  oxidation

the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide osmium tetroxide forms red osmates oso oh−  upon reaction with a base with ammonia it forms the nitridoosmates oso n− osmium tetroxide boils at  °c and is a powerful oxidizing agent by contrast osmium dioxide oso is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic only two osmium compounds have major applications osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis and the nonvolatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions osmium pentafluoride osf is known but osmium trifluoride osf has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state  is known only for osmium iodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co  represent oxidation state  in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σdonors such as amines and πacceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ and πdonors such as o− and n− despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis including aqua regia isotopesedit main article isotopes of osmium osmium has seven naturally occurring isotopes six of which are stable os os os os os and most abundant os os undergoes alpha decay with such a long halflife ±× years approximately   times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes but it has been observed only for os presumably due to very long halflives it is predicted that os and os can undergo double beta decay but this radioactivity has not been observed yet os is the daughter of re halflife ♠× years and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rheniumosmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rheniumrich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous–paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs  million years ago historyedit osmium was discovered in  by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england the discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the chocó department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in  chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor colletdescotils antoine françois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium the black platinum residue in  but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists antoinefrançois fourcroy and nicolaslouis vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’ in  smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene from the greek word πτηνος ptènos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis–osoho− by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june   uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in  cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrenceedit native platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals although osmium is one of the evennumbered elements which puts it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space osmium is the least abundant stable element in earths crust with an average mass fraction of  parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium–osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides ie ptpds tellurides eg ptbite antimonides eg pdsb and arsenides eg ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earths crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper–nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by precolumbian people in the chocó department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined productionedit osmium crystals grown by chemical vapor transport osmium is obtained commercially as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with nonmetallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction in order to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing watersoluble ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo  is separated from oso  by precipitation of nhrucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide the first method is similar to the procedure used by tennant and wollaston both methods are suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium estimations of the united states consumption date published from  which gives a consumption in the united states of  troy ounces  kg would suggest that the production is still less than  ton per year in  the estimated us production of osmium was  kg applicationsedit because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals those alloys are utilized in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinumgroup metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late  rpm and early lp and  record era circa  to  although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points osmiumalloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electrondense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials have otherwise very weak tem contrast see image another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless won the nobel prize in chemistry in  oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in  an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in  after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in  when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metalhydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at  å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in spacebased uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmiumcoated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of longterm side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible although this depends on the osmium compound administered in  osmiumvi and osmiumii compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs electron micrograph of organic plant tissue without top and with bottom oso staining the sharpless dihydroxylation rl  largest substituent rm  mediumsized substituent rs  smallest substituent postflight appearance of os ag and au mirrors from the front left images and rear panels of the space shuttle blackening reveals oxidation due to irradiation by oxygen atoms precautionsedit finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric and reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil priceedit osmium is usually sold as a minimum  pure powder like other precious metals it is measured by troy weight and by grams its price in  was about  per troy ounce or about  per kilogram depending on the quantity and its supplier

oxidation states are    and  the  oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridiums  and is encountered only in xenon ruthenium hassium and iridium the oxidation states − and − represented by the two reactive compounds na os co  and na osco  are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds the most common compound exhibiting the  oxidation state is osmium tetroxide this toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air it is a very volatile watersoluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide osmium tetroxide forms red osmates oso oh−  upon reaction with a base with ammonia it forms the nitridoosmates oso n− osmium tetroxide boils at  °c and is a powerful oxidizing agent by contrast osmium dioxide oso is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic only two osmium compounds have major applications osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis and the nonvolatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions osmium pentafluoride osf is known but osmium trifluoride osf has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state  is known only for osmium iodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co  represent oxidation state  in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σdonors such as amines and πacceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ and πdonors such as o− and n− despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis including aqua regia isotopesedit main article isotopes of osmium osmium has seven naturally occurring isotopes six of which are stable os os os os os and most abundant os os undergoes alpha decay with such a long halflife ±× years approximately   times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes but it has been observed only for os presumably due to very long halflives it is predicted that os and os can undergo double beta decay but this radioactivity has not been observed yet os is the daughter of re halflife ♠× years and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rheniumosmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rheniumrich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous–paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs  million years ago historyedit osmium was discovered in  by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england the discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the chocó department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in  chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor colletdescotils antoine françois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium the black platinum residue in  but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists antoinefrançois fourcroy and nicolaslouis vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’ in  smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene from the greek word πτηνος ptènos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis–osoho− by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june   uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in  cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrenceedit native platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals although osmium is one of the evennumbered elements which puts it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space osmium is the least abundant stable element in earths crust with an average mass fraction of  parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium–osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides ie ptpds tellurides eg ptbite antimonides eg pdsb and arsenides eg ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earths crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper–nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by precolumbian people in the chocó department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined productionedit osmium crystals grown by chemical vapor transport osmium is obtained commercially as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with nonmetallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction in order to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing watersoluble ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo  is separated from oso  by precipitation of nhrucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide the first method is similar to the procedure used by tennant and wollaston both methods are suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium estimations of the united states consumption date published from  which gives a consumption in the united states of  troy ounces  kg would suggest that the production is still less than  ton per year in  the estimated us production of osmium was  kg applicationsedit because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals those alloys are utilized in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinumgroup metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late  rpm and early lp and  record era circa  to  although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points osmiumalloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electrondense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials have otherwise very weak tem contrast see image another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless won the nobel prize in chemistry in  oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in  an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in  after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in  when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metalhydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at  å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in spacebased uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmiumcoated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of longterm side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible although this depends on the osmium compound administered in  osmiumvi and osmiumii compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs electron micrograph of organic plant tissue without top and with bottom oso staining the

space shuttle blackening reveals oxidation due to irradiation by oxygen atoms precautionsedit finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric and reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil priceedit osmium is usually sold as a minimum  pure powder like other precious metals it is measured by troy weight and by grams its price in  was about  per troy ounce or about  per kilogram depending on the quantity and its supplier

oxidation states are    and  the  oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridiums  and is encountered only in xenon ruthenium hassium and iridium the oxidation states − and − represented by the two reactive compounds na os co  and na osco  are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds the most common compound exhibiting the  oxidation state is osmium tetroxide this toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air it is a very volatile watersoluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide osmium tetroxide forms red osmates oso oh−  upon reaction with a base with ammonia it forms the nitridoosmates oso n− osmium tetroxide boils at  °c and is a powerful oxidizing agent by contrast osmium dioxide oso is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic only two osmium compounds have major applications osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis and the nonvolatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions osmium pentafluoride osf is known but osmium trifluoride osf has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state  is known only for osmium iodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co  represent oxidation state  in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σdonors such as amines and πacceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ and πdonors such as o− and n− despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis including aqua regia isotopesedit main article isotopes of osmium osmium has seven naturally occurring isotopes six of which are stable os os os os os and most abundant os os undergoes alpha decay with such a long halflife ±× years approximately   times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes but it has been observed only for os presumably due to very long halflives it is predicted that os and os can undergo double beta decay but this radioactivity has not been observed yet os is the daughter of re halflife ♠× years and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rheniumosmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rheniumrich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous–paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs  million years ago historyedit osmium was discovered in  by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england the discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the chocó department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in  chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor colletdescotils antoine françois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium the black platinum residue in  but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists antoinefrançois fourcroy and nicolaslouis vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’ in  smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene from the greek word πτηνος ptènos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis–osoho− by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june   uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in  cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrenceedit native platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals although osmium is one of the evennumbered elements which puts it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space osmium is the least abundant stable element in earths crust with an average mass fraction of  parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium–osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides ie ptpds tellurides eg ptbite antimonides eg pdsb and arsenides eg ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earths crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper–nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by precolumbian people in the chocó department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined productionedit osmium crystals grown by chemical vapor transport osmium is obtained commercially as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with nonmetallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction in order to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing watersoluble ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo  is separated from oso  by precipitation of nhrucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide the first method is similar to the procedure used by tennant and wollaston both methods are suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium estimations of the united states consumption date published from  which gives a consumption in the united states of  troy ounces  kg would suggest that the production is still less than  ton per year in  the estimated us production of osmium was  kg applicationsedit because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals those alloys are utilized in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinumgroup metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late  rpm and early lp and  record era circa  to  although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points osmiumalloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electrondense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials have otherwise very weak tem contrast see image another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless won the nobel prize in chemistry in  oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in  an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in  after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in  when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metalhydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at  å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in spacebased uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmiumcoated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of longterm side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible although this depends on the osmium compound administered in  osmiumvi and osmiumii compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs electron micrograph of organic plant tissue without top and with bottom oso staining the

space shuttle blackening reveals oxidation due to irradiation by oxygen atoms precautionsedit finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric and reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil priceedit osmium is usually sold as a minimum  pure powder like other precious metals it is measured by troy weight and by grams its price in  was about  per troy ounce or about  per kilogram depending on the quantity and its supplier

oxidation states of osmium − na osco  − na os co   os co   osi  osi   osbr   oso  oscl   osf   osf   osof   oso  osnch  osmium forms compounds with oxidation states ranging from − to  the most common oxidation states are    and  the  oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridiums  and is encountered only in xenon ruthenium hassium and iridium the oxidation states − and − represented by the two reactive compounds na os co  and na osco  are used in the synthesis of osmium cluster compounds the most common compound exhibiting the  oxidation state is osmium tetroxide this toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air it is a very volatile watersoluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide osmium tetroxide forms red osmates oso oh−  upon reaction with a base with ammonia it forms the nitridoosmates oso n− osmium tetroxide boils at  °c and is a powerful oxidizing agent by contrast osmium dioxide oso is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic only two osmium compounds have major applications osmium tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy and for the oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis and the nonvolatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions osmium pentafluoride osf is known but osmium trifluoride osf has not yet been synthesized the lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens so that the trichloride tribromide triiodide and even diiodide are known the oxidation state  is known only for osmium iodide osi whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium such as triosmium dodecacarbonyl os co  represent oxidation state  in general the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by ligands that are good σdonors such as amines and πacceptors heterocycles containing nitrogen the higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ and πdonors such as o− and n− despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis including aqua regia isotopesedit main article isotopes of osmium osmium has seven naturally occurring isotopes six of which are stable os os os os os and most abundant os os undergoes alpha decay with such a long halflife ±× years approximately   times the age of the universe that for practical purposes it can be considered stable alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes but it has been observed only for os presumably due to very long halflives it is predicted that os and os can undergo double beta decay but this radioactivity has not been observed yet os is the daughter of re halflife ♠× years and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as meteoric rocks see rheniumosmium dating it has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the mantle roots of continental cratons this decay is a reason why rheniumrich minerals are abnormally rich in os however the most notable application of os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium to characterise the layer of shocked quartz along the cretaceous–paleogene boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs  million years ago historyedit osmium was discovered in  by smithson tennant and william hyde wollaston in london england the discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group platinum reached europe as platina small silver first encountered in the late th century in silver mines around the chocó department in colombia the discovery that this metal was not an alloy but a distinct new element was published in  chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids to create soluble salts they always observed a small amount of a dark insoluble residue joseph louis proust thought that the residue was graphite victor colletdescotils antoine françois comte de fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin also observed iridium the black platinum residue in  but did not obtain enough material for further experiments later the two french chemists antoinefrançois fourcroy and nicolaslouis vauquelin identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘ptène’ in  smithson tennant analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene from the greek word πτηνος ptènos for winged however tennant who had the advantage of a much larger amount of residue continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue iridium and osmium he obtained a yellow solution probably of cis–osoho− by reactions with sodium hydroxide at red heat after acidification he was able to distill the formed oso he named it osmium after greek osme meaning a smell because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the royal society on june   uranium and osmium were early successful catalysts in the haber process the nitrogen fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia giving enough yield to make the process economically successful at the time a group at basf led by carl bosch bought most of the worlds supply of osmium to use as a catalyst shortly thereafter in  cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium nowadays osmium is obtained primarily from the processing of platinum and nickel ores occurrenceedit native platinum containing traces of the other platinum group metals although osmium is one of the evennumbered elements which puts it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space osmium is the least abundant stable element in earths crust with an average mass fraction of  parts per trillion in the continental crust osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys especially the iridium–osmium alloys osmiridium osmium rich and iridosmium iridium rich in nickel and copper deposits the platinum group metals occur as sulfides ie ptpds tellurides eg ptbite antimonides eg pdsb and arsenides eg ptas in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium as with all of the platinum group metals osmium can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper within earths crust osmium like iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure igneous deposits crustal intrusions from below impact craters and deposits reworked from one of the former structures the largest known primary reserves are in the bushveld igneous complex in south africa though the large copper–nickel deposits near norilsk in russia and the sudbury basin in canada are also significant sources of osmium smaller reserves can be found in the united states the alluvial deposits used by precolumbian people in the chocó department colombia are still a source for platinum group metals the second large alluvial deposit was found in the ural mountains russia which is still mined productionedit osmium crystals grown by chemical vapor transport osmium is obtained commercially as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and processing during electrorefining of copper and nickel noble metals such as silver gold and the platinum group metals together with nonmetallic elements such as selenium and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud which forms the starting material for their extraction in order to separate the metals they must first be brought into solution several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid osmium ruthenium rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia leaving a solid residue rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate the insoluble residue containing ru os and ir is treated with sodium oxide in which ir is insoluble producing watersoluble ru and os salts after oxidation to the volatile oxides ruo  is separated from oso  by precipitation of nhrucl with ammonium chloride after it is dissolved osmium is separated from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide the first method is similar to the procedure used by tennant and wollaston both methods are suitable for industrial scale production in either case the product is reduced using hydrogen yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques neither the producers nor the united states geological survey published any production amounts for osmium estimations of the united states consumption date published from  which gives a consumption in the united states of  troy ounces  kg would suggest that the production is still less than  ton per year in  the estimated us production of osmium was  kg applicationsedit because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state but is instead often alloyed with other metals those alloys are utilized in highwear applications osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and along with other platinumgroup metals are used in the tips of fountain pens instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent operation they were also used for the tips of phonograph styli during the late  rpm and early lp and  record era circa  to  although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points osmiumalloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing and costlier sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them because osmium atoms are extremely electrondense osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy tem studies of biological materials those carbon materials have otherwise very weak tem contrast see image another osmium compound osmium ferricyanide osfecn exhibits similar fixing and staining action the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous for the sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation which uses osmate for the conversion of a double bond into a vicinal diol karl barry sharpless won the nobel prize in chemistry in  oso is very expensive for this use so kmno is often used instead even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent in  an austrian chemist auer von welsbach developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in  after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal tungsten tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps the light bulb manufacturer osram founded in  when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram the latter is german for tungsten like palladium powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms this could make osmium a potential candidate for a metalhydride battery electrode however osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide the most common battery electrolyte osmium has high reflectivity in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum for example at  å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold this high reflectivity is desirable in spacebased uv spectrometers which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations osmiumcoated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the space shuttle but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the low earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer the only known clinical use of osmium appears to be for synovectomy in arthritic patients in scandinavia it involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide oso which is a highly toxic compound the lack of reports of longterm side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible although this depends on the osmium compound administered in  osmiumvi and osmiumii compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs electron micrograph of organic plant tissue without top and with bottom oso staining the sharpless dihydroxylation rl  largest substituent rm  mediumsized substituent rs  smallest substituent postflight appearance of os ag and au mirrors from the front left images and rear panels of the space shuttle blackening reveals oxidation due to irradiation by oxygen atoms precautionsedit finely divided metallic osmium is pyrophoric and reacts with oxygen at room temperature forming volatile osmium tetroxide some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present this makes osmium tetroxide the main source of contact with the environment osmium tetroxide is highly volatile and penetrates skin readily and is very toxic by inhalation ingestion and skin contact airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage and should therefore be used in a fume hood osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn oil priceedit osmium is usually sold as a minimum  pure powder like other precious metals it is measured by troy weight and by grams its price in  was about  per troy ounce or about  per kilogram depending on the quantity and its supplier
