republican nominee by chris bragg comments email print × photo andrew hawkins republican mayoral nominee joseph lhota will face off against democratic candidate bill de blasio in the november election this week in crains september   listen to the podcast or download last december when joseph lhota resigned as chairman of the metropolitan transit authority to launch a mayoral bid many business leaders indicated theyd take a waitandsee approach to his underdog candidacy in a city that is heavily democratic at a minimum the business community will be hedging its bets explained kathryn wylde president and ceo of the partnership for new york city an organization of the citys largest private employers it is still likely that the person who comes out of the democratic primary will be the mayor at the time city council speaker christine quinn was perceived as mayor michael bloombergs businessfriendly successor but in last weeks democratic primary ms quinn placed a distant third while the most liberal contender public advocate bill de blasio outpaced the field former city comptroller bill thompson who like ms quinn is perceived as businessfriendly finished a distant second and may not even qualify for a runoff with mr de blasio article continues below advertisement the results raise the question of whether the business community will move behind mr lhota despite his odds in a city with six democrats for every republican mr lhota had raised a total of  million as of late august compared with mr de blasios  million but mr de blasios taxandspend pledges may change that the real estate industry and others in new york have to be noticing bill de blasios rhetoric said republican consultant bill oreilly theres no going back to the center from where he is friends supply funds so far business interests have wagered more on mr de blasio whose major campaign contributors such as the real estate and taxi industries have financial stakes in city policy mr lhotas biggest fundraisers have been former giuliani administration colleagues of the  bundlers who have raised more than  for him six worked in the administration with mr lhota who was deputy mayor and budget director many of them retain ties to city government mr lhotas biggest campaign bundler is robert harding an attorney who has raised more than  much of it from his politically prominent law firm greenberg traurig mr harding is the son of the late liberal party head raymond harding who had extremely close ties with mr giuliani and later pleaded guilty to securities violations in  the sons appointment as mr giulianis budget director in  raised eyebrows because he had little experience managing fiscal matters other major lhota bundlers from the giuliani world include former deputy mayor randy mastro a politically connected attorney who in classic bethedging style was also a major bundler for the democratic mr thompson agostino cangemi an assistant counsel in the giuliani administration who is now a lobbyist john odermatt a former commissioner of the office of emergency management and now a managing director at citigroup and john mascialino a former official in the department of citywide administrative services and an attorney who now heads greenberg traurigs government and law policy practice mr lhotas postgiuliani stint as an executive vice president of cablevision is also proving helpful in his run for mayor the companys president and ceo james dolan has raised more than  while richard hochman a business consultant who is mr lhotas secondbiggest fundraiser has served on cablevisions board of directors mr hochman said he does not have business before the city that would benefit from a lhota administration he gave to mr lhota he added because of their personal relationship and because he believes the candidate would preserve the gains of the bloomberg and giuliani eras i grew up in this city mr hochman said i saw it in  i saw it in the s and for the past  years giuliani and bloomberg made it such a better place to live i dont want to go back given mr de blasios momentum mr lhota must reach beyond his inner circle perhaps even to disaffected supporters of mr de blasios vanquished democratic rivals during the republican primary billionaire opponent john catsimatidis repeatedly said that mr lhota could not compete in november because of a lack of resources mr bloomberg running as a republican and independent spent more than  million to eke out a third term in  billionaire steps up mr lhota is getting help from an outside group called new yorkers for proven leadership which was started by three former giuliani aides it has already received  from billionaire david koch and his wife and is launching a national fundraising effort touting mr lhota as a moderate republican who can win in a deepblue city like mr lhotas campaign the committee might struggle to get enough donations to make a major impact as new york republicans have in recent statewide elections but a spokesman for the group michael mckeon said he believed business supporters of ms quinn and mr thompson would now flock to mr lhota i think people who supported the other candidates are now going to take a harder look at a guy who is the most liberal candidate and the farthest to the left said mr mckeon theyre going to take a hard look at de blasio and theyre going to take a second look at joe that will be an uphill fight as the vanquished democrats have all pledged to support their partys nominee a number of democrats crossed party lines to support mr bloomberg in his  and  reelection campaigns but mr lhota lacks several advantages that the mayor had incumbency weak competition and an unlimited campaign budget mr lhotas thirdlargest fundraiser joseph dussich of jad corp of america stands out as the rare businessowning lhota bundler whose company might benefit from a lhota mayoralty mr dussich a queens building maintenance supplies dealer who had raised more than  through july received a visit from mr lhota in august during a tour of small businesses mr lhota touted the mintscented trash bags sold by mr dussich that can repel mice raccoons and other critters during the visit mr dussich who did not return a request for comment lamented that the parks department was rebuffing his efforts to sell the trash bags to the city mr lhota called it the type of product that could keep manufacturing jobs in the city of course you can if you put your mind to it mr lhota said according to the new york times

a member who had been recommended by mayor bill de blasio many of the authority’s announcements come from the governor’s office she said and his preferences were prioritized in the fiveyear capital planinstead of an increase in the governor’s power the board needs independence ms vanterpool said“we need to ensure the decisions we’re making are on behalf of the public that we serve and not caught up in this political process that we’re often hampered by” ms vanterpool saidjames e vitiello a board member from dutchess county said he did not understand why mr cuomo was suddenly trying to change

the main story photo joseph j lhota campaigning for new york city mayor in  credit damon winterthe new york times joseph j lhota is perhaps best known for bringing the new york city subway back from one of its darkest moments after hurricane sandy flooded the system in  now he faces another daunting task rescuing it from a growing crisis that threatens to cripple the city’s continued growthwith subway delays mounting and riders irate gov andrew m cuomo turned to a familiar face on wednesday mr lhota a former chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority who will return for a second actstate lawmakers applauded the decision to bring back mr lhota who served as chairman for about a year before stepping down in  to run for mayor of new york city mr lhota a deputy mayor under rudolph w giuliani used the good will he gained after the storm to run as a republican but lost to bill de blasio in a landslidehis appointment — a latenight surprise on the final day of the legislative session in albany — almost did not happen on thursday mr cuomo said mr lhota “didn’t say yes until  minutes before we put his name up” advertisement continue reading the main story mr lhota confirmed in an interview that it had taken a bit of prodding from the governor to convince him “i wouldn’t call it armtwisting” he said “i had to do some soul searching” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story ultimately mr lhota said he knew the system was broken and he wanted to help fix it“i love a challenge and anyone who knows me knows i love a challenge” he said “it ain’t going to be easy” photo from left mr lhota veronique hakim the mta’s interim executive director and fernando ferrer the acting chairman credit richard drewassociated press mr lhota is known for his outspoken style from amusing twitter posts about having sipped “too much wine” and his distaste for “jersey shore” to his contentious take that subway trains should not stop for kittens on the tracks which prompted a daily news cover reading “die kitties die” he is also a subway rider using the no  and  lines to travel from his home in brooklyn heightsbut mr lhota now confronts a dire challenge the subway is plagued by skyrocketing delays and fraying infrastructure long island rail road commuters are facing a “summer of hell” as tracks are repaired at pennsylvania station the sprawling transit network needs billions of dollars in repairs and mr lhota told lawmakers on wednesday that fixing the subway would probably require even more painful disruptions for ridersbusiness leaders and transit advocates welcomed his returnmr cuomo “has once again recruited an excellent leader for one of the toughest jobs in government” said kathryn s wylde president of the partnership for new york city an influential business group “joe lhota led the mta through hurricane sandy and is the right choice to lead the mta through the current crisis”the governor’s office said mr lhota would continue to serve as a senior vice president at nyu langone medical center and would receive an annual salary of  as chairman a separate executive officer will handle the agency’s daily operations a role mr cuomo said he was still seeking to fill the arrangement is a departure from recent years when one fulltime leader served both rolesmr de blasio threw his support behind mr lhota on thursday saying he was the right person for the job when the agency was at a crossroads asked whether mr cuomo was trying to “poke a stick” in his eye by naming mr lhota mr de blasio said “i think it has nothing to do with politics”“joe lhota and i ran against each other but i have a lot of respect for him” mr de blasio said in a radio interview on wnyc advertisement continue reading the main story but a few hours later mr cuomo turned on mr de blasio saying the city should pay more toward the mta and complaining that he as governor did not have the control he needed over the agency mr cuomo had proposed legislation to add two members to the authority’s board whom he could appoint but it failed to pass at the end of the session photo workers installed upgraded switching equipment on the b train tracks under th street in manhattan earlier this year credit kevin hagen for the new york times though mr cuomo has taken a handson role at the authority he said the way it was set up made it unclear who was in control“who’s in charge” he asked reporters “who knows”mr lhota’s appointment was a surprise in part because he had said in january that he was not interested in response to a twitter post asking who would succeed the authority’s previous chairman and chief executive thomas f prendergast he was unequivocal “not joelhota that’s a fact” newsletter sign up continue reading the

shortly before adjourning for the yearin a hastily called senate meeting wednesday night mr lhota took questions from lawmakers via skype he noted that the subway runs around the clock and said that in order to replace the antiquated signal system — which dates to the s and frequently fails causing delays — officials might have to temporarily shut down lines despite the hardship that would cause riders“if we want to get the signal system in as fast as possible we’re going to have to do something like that” he saidstate senator michael gianaris democrat of queens said the latenight meeting offered little opportunity for public discussion and criticized lawmakers for failing to address the subway crisis“better management is only part of the problem” mr gianaris said “a lack of resources
