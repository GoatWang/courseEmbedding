oxygen sensing and gene regulation after work on plant and microbial oxygenases he studied uncharacterized human oxygenases his research has identified unanticipated roles for oxygenases in regulating gene expression importantly in the cellular hypoxic response and has revealed new posttranslational modifications to chromatin and rna splicing proteins the work has identified new opportunities for

departmental demonstrator in the dyson perrins laboratory oxford university followed by his appointment as a lecturer in chemistry and a fellow of hertford college in  in  he became professor of chemistry and in  he was appointed the head of organic chemistry at the department of chemistry university of oxford in  he was elected a fellow of the royal society frs researchedit the work in laboratory of chris schofield focuses on different areas of research including molecular mechanisms of the hypoxic responseedit hypoxiainducible factor hif is a heterodimeric αβtranscriptional complex that mediates the cellular response to oxygen availability in multicellular organisms ranging from the simplest known animal trichoplax adhaerens to humans investigating the structures and mechanisms of the hif prolyl hydroxylases is a current focus of the work the group solved crystal structures of phd  one of the human prolyl hydroxylases  and discovered that the hif asparaginyl hydroxylase also catalyzes hydroxylation of conserved motifs the ankyrin repeat domain chemical basis of epigeneticsedit a current focus of the group is modification of histones in particular oxygenase catalyzed ndemethylation of histone methylatedlysine residues – in collaboration with the structural genomics consortium the histone demethylases are of interest both with respect to their links to diseases including cancer and inflammatory diseases as well as the role of methylation in transcriptional regulation recent areas of interest include the fat mass and obesity protein which was shown to be a nucleic acid demethylase and jmjd which is a lysyl hydroxylase modifying rna splicing protein structural and functional studies on og oxygenasesedit the oxoglutarate ogdependent oxygenases are a superfamily of nonhaem iron dependent oxygenases most of which use the krebs cycle intermediate og as a cosubstrate the group are interested in understanding these enzymes for their ability to catalyze synthetically difficult or ‘impossible’ reactions eg the stereoselective hydroxylation of unactivated carbonhydrogen bonds for their diverse physiological roles and for their links to disease the research focuses on members of the family that are linked to disease or can be targeted for the treatment of disease techniques involved in this interdisciplinary research include proteomics xray crystallography biological mass spectrometry molecular biology enzyme kinetics and organic synthesismedicinal chemistry antibiotics biosynthesis and resistance mechanismsedit most clinically used antibiotics are based upon natural products the most important family of antibiotics contains a βlactam ring and includes the penicillin cephalosporin clavam and carbapenem antibiotics the groups biosynthetic work has focused on the clavams and carbapenems with a particular focus being on the mechanism and structures of enzymes that catalyze chemically interesting steps the biggest threat to the continued use of βlactam antibiotics is that of bacterial resistance prof schofield is currently working on the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitors for the metallo βlactamases – there are no clinically used inhibitor of these enzymes but they pose a significant threat as they catalyze the hydrolysis of almost all clinically used βlactam antibiotics a particular interest involves human metallo βlactamases which share the same fold awards and honorsedit  wellcome trust advanced investigator award with prof sir peter ratcliffe  fellow of the royal society london member of embo fellow

schofield studied functional structural and mechanistic understanding of enzymes that employ oxygen and oxoglutarate as a cosubstrate his work has opened up new possibilities in antibiotic research oxygen sensing and gene regulation after work on plant and microbial oxygenases he studied uncharacterized human oxygenases his research has identified unanticipated roles for oxygenases in regulating gene expression importantly in the cellular hypoxic response and has revealed new posttranslational modifications to chromatin and rna splicing proteins the work has identified new opportunities for

bachelor of science in chemistry at the university of manchester and graduated with a first class honor  in  he moved to oxford to study for a dphil with professor jack e baldwin in  he became a departmental demonstrator in the dyson perrins laboratory oxford university followed by his appointment as a lecturer in chemistry and a fellow of hertford college in  in  he became professor of chemistry and in  he was appointed the head of organic chemistry at the department of chemistry university of oxford in  he was elected a fellow of the royal society frs researchedit the work in laboratory of chris schofield focuses on different areas of research including molecular mechanisms of the hypoxic responseedit hypoxiainducible factor hif is a heterodimeric αβtranscriptional complex that mediates the cellular response to oxygen availability in multicellular organisms ranging from the simplest known animal trichoplax adhaerens to humans investigating the structures and mechanisms of the hif prolyl hydroxylases is a current focus of the work the group solved crystal structures of phd  one of the human prolyl hydroxylases  and discovered that the hif asparaginyl hydroxylase also catalyzes hydroxylation of conserved motifs the ankyrin repeat domain chemical basis of epigeneticsedit a current focus of the group is modification of histones in particular oxygenase catalyzed ndemethylation of histone methylatedlysine residues – in collaboration with the structural genomics consortium the histone demethylases are of interest both with respect to their links to diseases including cancer and inflammatory diseases as well as the role of methylation in transcriptional regulation recent areas of interest include the fat mass and obesity protein which was shown to be a nucleic acid demethylase and jmjd which is a lysyl hydroxylase modifying rna splicing protein structural and functional studies on og oxygenasesedit the oxoglutarate ogdependent oxygenases are a superfamily of nonhaem iron dependent oxygenases most of which use the krebs cycle intermediate og as a cosubstrate the group are interested in understanding these enzymes for their ability to catalyze synthetically difficult or ‘impossible’ reactions eg the stereoselective hydroxylation of unactivated carbonhydrogen bonds for their diverse physiological roles and for their links to disease the research focuses on members of the family that are linked to disease or can be targeted for the treatment of disease techniques involved in this interdisciplinary research include proteomics xray crystallography biological mass spectrometry molecular biology enzyme kinetics and organic synthesismedicinal chemistry antibiotics biosynthesis and resistance mechanismsedit most clinically used antibiotics are based upon natural products the most important family of antibiotics contains a βlactam ring and includes the penicillin cephalosporin clavam and carbapenem antibiotics the groups biosynthetic work has focused on the clavams and carbapenems with a particular focus being on the mechanism and structures of enzymes that catalyze chemically interesting steps the biggest threat to the continued use of βlactam antibiotics is that of bacterial resistance prof schofield is currently working on the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitors for the metallo βlactamases – there are no clinically used inhibitor of these enzymes but they pose a significant threat as they catalyze the hydrolysis of almost all clinically used βlactam antibiotics a particular interest involves human metallo βlactamases which share the same fold awards and honorsedit  wellcome trust advanced investigator award with prof sir peter ratcliffe  fellow of the royal society london member of embo fellow
