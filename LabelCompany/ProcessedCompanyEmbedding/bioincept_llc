preimplantation factor pif a global research network preimplantation factor pif the discovery science and importance our science etharums ser quidem rerum facilis dolores nemis omnis fugats vitaes nemo minima rerums unsers sadips amets about preimplantation factor pif pif is pivotal for reproductive success and immune modulation the discovery of pif represents a paradigm shift in understanding mammalian pregnancy its premise is that the burden of successful pregnancy resides not with the mother as previously thought but with the embryofetus and its ability to secrete pif while researching causative factors associated with early pregnancy dr eytan barnea discovered pif a naturally occurring peptide secreted only by viable mammalian embryos pif is secreted and detected as early as the cell stage and it continues to do so throughout pregnancy in nonviable embryos pif is either absent or negligible the discovery of pif helps to explain why at the inception of and during pregnancy the mother’s immune system does not reject the embryo this event at its very core is a perfect transplant in a welladapted immune environment pif enables maternal immunity to simultaneously tolerate the embryo and continue to protect both mother and embryo against disease the barnea research group a worldwide network of pif researchers quickly ascertained that pif’s immunemodulatory effects offer potential therapeutic benefits across diverse disease areas in pregnancy and extending into disorders of immunity and transplant synthetic pif currently used in clinical trials was produced following the identification of native pif to date pif has been studied in more than  different mammalian pregnant and nonpregnant models generating compelling evidence to establish pif’s potential impact as a diagnostic and single therapeutic agent pifbased diagnostics for in vitro fertilization ivf viable embryo identification is currently in multicenter clinical trials in parallel research continues to study pif’s mode of action corroborating its comprehensive local and systemic regulatory role possible pif translational applications identified and studied to date include pregnancy ie embryo viability recurrent pregnancy loss premature labor  preeclampsia immunity ie disorders affecting the liver gastrointestinal tract and skin injury ie traumatic brain injury acute radiation syndrome and transplant ie bone marrow and organs unlike immune suppressant drugs that are associated with serious side effects pif regulates local and systemic immune response through targeted effects in a safe nontoxic manner pif represents a new drug entity nde and given its potential and high safety margin was awarded the coveted fasttrack designation by the fdathis discovery has broad translational therapeutic implications for treating pregnancy disorders organ transplant rejection and immune diseases pif is at the center of numerous current and upcoming human clinical trials worldwide
