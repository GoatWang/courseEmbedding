larger community banks rather than the major money centers given the many issues being faced by larger banks emanating from the financial crisis the emphasis is on institutions that have strong and or improving balance sheets with access to the capital markets seasoned managements acquisition knowhow and minimal credit quality issues from time to time mendon will also select other banks that offer
