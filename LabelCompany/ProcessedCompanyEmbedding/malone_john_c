since most institutions are long investors only returns for long transactions are shown here ken auletta  articles  john malone flying solo subscribe enter your email to joinken aulettas kattalist today   hosted by topica   article annals of communications the new yorker  february   john malone flying solo john malone who engineered the merger between his tci and bell atlantic is the pioneering cable titan whom al gore once called darth vader despite charges of monopoly and deception malone has become the most powerful man in television and has the industry and capitol hill wondering where hell go next by ken auletta there is no television set in john c malones office this seems odd since malone the president and chief executive officer of telecommunications inc is the most influential man in television after twenty years at the helm of tci malone now controls one of every four cable boxes in the country and through tci and liberty media a programming company formerly owned by tci he has an interest in twentynine cable services including cnn tnt qvc court tv black entertainment television american movie classics and the discovery channel malone and his company have important business links to such corporate giants as rupert murdochs news corporation ted turners turner broadcasting system bill gates microsoft and at  t they have branched out into the telephone business here and abroad and in addition they are building two broadcast satellites in all since malone started at tci in  the company has acquired invested in or become a partner of about six hundred and fifty companies for all his previous success malones most important deal was announced at a press conference in manhattan on october   when he and raymond w smith the chairman of bell atlantic corporation said that their companies would merge in a stockforstock transaction valued at thirtythree billion dollars it was the biggest merger ever in the communications industry giving birth to a behemoth that will reach twentythree per cent of american homes will be able to call upon sixty billion dollars in assets and will rank as the sixthlargest american company the merger increased malones worthnow some one billion one hundred million dollarsby about three hundred million dollars and made him and tcis founder robert magness major shareholders in the new company malone will own one and a half per cent of the stock magness two and a half per cent this merger shifted the fundamental balance of power in the communications industry a year ago malone boasted of how the cable industry would best the telephone companies he was captain of the cable team says brian roberts who is the president the countrys fourthlargest cable system the comcast corporation and has been a partner of malones in various cable ventures but now he is straddling two industriesperhaps as captain of both teams one cable programmer in discussing the power that malone has notes that a number of the cable systems in america can accept only about fifteen channelsa limitation that precludes newer programming services if tcis cable boxes arent available whats left is too small an audience to support a profitable service a cable executive who does business with tci explains the situation this way imagine that you have all these publishing houses but only one book chain in the united states you can write the best book but what happens if you cant get into the bookstore john malone is the bookstore malone transacts his business from an eleventhfloor corner office in a corporate park in suburban denver a block of gray granite serves as his desk cactus plants surround an lshaped couch of gray leather the two exterior walls are windows and from them one sees nothing but the snowcapped rockies except for a sixfoothigh replica of an  americas cup sailboat that stands on a stark black marble credenza behind his desk and a smaller carved replica of ragtime a sixtyfourfoot motorized commuter boat built in  to go from long island to manhattan which malone restored and now uses in maine the office seems impersonal there are no photographs or plaques the only touch of whimsy is a large fakefur gorilla dressed in a white tshirt and a red cnn tie which sits on a chair facing the door malone instructs entering visitors say hello to ray smith when malone appears on industry panels or testifies before congressional committees he seems a frosty figure dressed in boxy suits and wearing the strained expression of a scientist or an investment banker in colorado as i found during a recent week with him he seems much more relaxed malone is five feet eleven and squareshouldered he is fiftytwo years old smooth skin a square jaw a long thin straight nose a tight smile and burly biceps give him the look of a retired fighter pilot sports shirts slacks and loafers are what he wears to work he drives a gray  bmw or on snowy days a  chevy pickup with a plow of late an arthritic condition has caused him to walk with a slight limp which makes him appear almost vulnerable he speaks in a monotone but there is about him an unmistakable intensity his eyes are hazel and they fasten on visitors hes so focussed says diane m grimshaw who was malones secretary and administrative assistant for eighteen years and in  became tcis director of facilities i used to say that i could walk through his office stark naked and he wouldnt notice malone does not indulge in bombast or theatrics when he is talking his hands usually remain jammed in his trouser pockets or wrapped around a coffee mug he is an intense listener on the phone when ted turner or anyone else calls him his conversations are unhurried nearleisurely he proffers advice he steadies he calculates he is a man of science he has a phd from johns hopkins university in operations research which centers on the construction of mathematical models in his business life he strives for pure logic unalloyed by emotion unswayed by friendship or sentiment he hates political noise and what he sees as washingtons aversion to facts of turner whom he counts as a friend and a business partner he says hes a very sound businessman the only problem is that sometimes he lets emotions get the better of him the telephone does not ring in malones officeexcept when his wife leslie calls on a line reserved for her all other calls are screened by a lone secretary for a man driven to succeed malone has an unusually brief office dayfive and a half hours he arrives at about  am leaves at  am to drive home for lunch with his wife returns just before  pm and leaves three hours later sometimes to meet leslie at a local health club to accommodate his wife who will not fly he bought a customized recreational vehicle two years agoa land yacht he calls it noting that it is the same size as a greyhound bus twice a year in late january and in early june they pack their dogsseven of theminto the vehicle fill the tank and drive nearly forty hours to boothbay maine where they have a vacation home they spend several months a year there malone and his tci executives see themselves as outsiders who have successfully bucked the networks and the big boys of new york and hollywood by helping pioneer cnn and black entertainment television to do so theyve had to be tough and though to many malone remains the wicked witch of the west al gore as a senator referred to him as darth vader admiring associates see him as both a genius and a liberated balanced man his mind is like a rubiks cube according to peter barton liberty medias president take all these colors and six sides barton says every square moves its a lot to keep track of now think of a whole bunch of disparate concepts as a whole bunch of unrelated colors now remember whats on each square and move the cube around until the concepts fit together that requires an extraordinary amount of memory and processing capability john does this michael fuchs the chairman and ceo of hbo says that along with the investor warren buffett and bill gates the chairman of microsoft malone is one of the best businessmen in the country and adds the guy is brilliant fuchs who serves with malone on the board of turner broadcasting and is a sometime adversary says malone knows everyone in the industry but is a personal friend of no one its all business always malone is guarded acutely aware that as cable and telephone and film and electronics and publishing and broadcasting companies continue to merge an ally in one business or region becomes a competitor in another being a ceo is lonely he says unapologetically malone has always prided himself on going solo one of his most vivid childhood memories is of walking or driving past cemeteries and noticing the awful sameness of the gravestones nothing different he says nothing distinctive nothing unique so ive always wanted to be different always wanted to be unique he and an older sister grew up in an eighteenthcentury colonial house in a bluecollar neighborhood in milford connecticut for several years his father who was an engineer with general electric commuted to a ge plant in syracuse new york on sunday night and did not return home until the next saturday malone worshipped his father and refers to him affectionately as an intellectual with white socks his mother was a worldclass swimmer she earned a masters degree in education from temple university and interrupted a teaching career to bring up her children but he remembers that she was a remote figure who did not hug her daughter or her son because she had some fundamental insecurities malone thinks of his father as a strict calvinist and he also recalls that he was tight with a dime and insistent on two things a rigorous work ethic and a conviction that president franklin d roosevelt was a socialist or worse i lived american graffiti  malone says referring to the movie about teenagers in the early nineteensixties he recalls souping up cars and cruising the boulevard in school he had a nearly photographic memory and could recite entire passages from textbooks when the soviet union launched sputnik i in  and america was frantic to reclaim the lead in space outstanding science students were in demand john malone was awarded a scholarship to hopkins grammar school in new haven malone commuted daily to hopkins where he shone but he was torn between his bluecollar friends and his intellect his friends often taunted him and he got into numerous fistfights i was neither a preppie nor a town kid he says so i put a lot of energy into athletics he got letters in fencing track and soccer it was raw drive not skill he says in the summer of  when malone was about to enter yale he was at the beach with friends one day when his sister approached and asked want to meet a nice girl the girl was leslie ann evans a fifteenyearold neighbor malone recalls strolling along the beach with leslie and he remembers making a silent vow that they would marry while leslie finished high school and worked as a secretary with the milford police department he attended yale science courses enthralled him but social sciences did not thinking of himself as an individualistic conservative he felt that his teachers and most students were socialistic he argued with his teachers and he says that his grades suffered as a result but when i got over into engineering of course the answers were either right or wrong he says so as soon as i got into engineering school my grades took off malone graduated with a bs in electrical engineering in  he and leslie were married later that year and he went to work for at  ts bell labs bell helped finance two masters degrees that malone receivedfrom johns hopkins in industrial management in  and from new york university in electrical engineering in and his doctorate from johns hopkins in  a rising star malone may have been smarter and better paid than his peers at bell but he felt like one of many tombstones the odds were that you were going to spend your whole life writing memos and making basically no impact on anything he recalls he hated the timidity the bureaucracy looking around he says he saw guys who had been me ten years earlier who had basically given up he was determined not to give up in  malone joined the managementconsulting firm of mckinsey  company seeing it as a place to retoolas an opportunity to go from science to business the malones moved into a house in weston connecticut leslie expected that john would be home as often as he had been while he was working for bell labs and could join in bringing up a family the couple have a daughter tracy and a son evan he wasnt going to be like his dad with a home in one state and a job in another on his first day at mckinsey he found a note on his desk telling him that a client expected him in montreal for lunch he stayed in montreal six weeks from then on since his clients included ibm ge and other lofty corporations malone was often travelling while malone was at mckinsey he saw the marriages of colleagues dissolve he told his wife that he would find a job requiring less travel in  he joined the general instrument corporation and was soon named president of its cabletv division jerrold electronics over the next several years jerrold became a dominant force in cable malone got to know most of the pioneers in the infant cable industry including steve ross of warner communications and bob magness a parttime cattle rancher and cottonseed salesman who wanted to improve television reception in rural areas magness owned a struggling cable system based in denver that reached into twentythree states and also a new microwave broadcast company in  ross tried to hire malone to head warners cable operations magness offered him the presidency of the fouryearold tci leslie was not happy living in the east she had a daughter who rarely saw her dad she wanted to have family dinners at home and to live someplace where they could keep horses as for her husband he recalls i wanted to get out of new york i liked steve an awful lot i found him to be hypnotic but i wanted to spend time with my family i had made this commitment to my wife that we were going to have a more normal life he and magness envisioned loosening the stranglehold that in malones words three channels controlled by three guys in new york maintained on a typical evening in the midseventies nine out of ten viewers watched cbs or nbc or abc and the only national cable service was hbo which was then relatively small malone took a fiftypercent cut in pay and accepted sixty thousand dollars a year as chief executive officer of tci magness would be his partner the company chairman malones base would be denver which was the capital of the embryonic cable industry tim wirth who served as a democratic senator from colorado and is now counsellor of the department of state recalls attending a cable meeting at a denver hotel not long after malone arrived in town wirth says i remember malones determinationto change cable regulations you could see his crooked little smile he looked at you with that smile and you could tell that behind it was a tank malone had reason to feel determined soon after he agreed to join tci in late  the stock market fell and interest rates climbed then within months oil prices soared tci had a hundred and thirty million dollars in debt and nineteen million in revenues malone recalls despite his good intentions malone was rarely home of course i might as well have stayed in the east he says i was living where the banks werein new york and bostonfor the next five years his mission was not to expand the business but to save it from bankruptcy we looked catastrophe in the face every day magness recalls when he and malone travelled to make their pitch to creditors the two shared a motel room hourly employees were put on a fourday work week we had to be very tough malone says the backstothewall circumstances of their early years combined with their sense of mission and with malones calvinist proclivities and magnesss cowboy nature helped to shape a corporate culture that has by now become either entrepreneurial or ruthless depending on ones vantage point it was malone and magness against the world he was my board of directors malone says of the chairman whom he still calls a mentor a father figure a friend a partner tci achieved a breakthrough in  when malone persuaded seven insurance companies to refinance his bank debt with longerterm capital money was thus loosened enough to begin making modest acquisitions more money poured in after hbo and ted turner made their cableprogramming breakthroughs in the late seventies and cablecompany stocks soared malone had put out tcis business fires but he was having problems at home speaking of his wife malone sheds his reserve and becomes almost confessional she always felt she came second he says shes always felt i havent honored the youcomefirst thekidscomesecond and careercomesthird commitment and i think with some validity as malone remembers it she told him in the early seventies i thought i was marrying an engineer at bell labs you were going to be home every night we were going to have a normal middleclass life and raise the kids and take the twoweek vacation and so on and now youre off on this ego trip of building a career youre off running companies things that i never bought into and thats something you gotta go do so do it but im not coming along goodbye im leaving malone had reassured her that denver would be different but so far it had been worse now he promised to change they bought a  stanford white house on sixtythree acres in boothbay then tci acquired its first jet and the plane allowed malone to shorten twoday business trips to one day in denver he and leslie started going to a health club together diane grimshaw who was then malones assistant says of them a lot of johns motivation is his wife david e rapley who runs a successful engineering firm in the denver area and with his wife sandra is among john and leslie malones few intimate friends says its difficult for him to talk about his innermost feelings yet he has a real soft center hes a very analytical thinker hes an engineer trained in logical thinking facts hes not as comfortable with emotions rapley says that by contrast leslie is a touchyfeely person yet rapley sees malone as totally dependent on his wife if god forbid anything happened to leslie it would be hard for john to make a life he says it would be easier for leslie to carry on without john shes had to make her own life she paints she buys antiques she has studied interior design by nature she has more gaiety grimshaw looking back on her years as malones assistant observes i really noticed a difference in john he began to listen more to open up a bit she recalls he began to pick up tracy and evan after school when leslie was busy with her own projects he began to buy her presents once he arranged for a dealer to park a red jaguar outside their health club when they emerged she spotted it and said to john oh theres that car i like and he said here heres the keys malone could have the jaguar and the jet plane because tci was now thriving a dollar invested in tci in  was worth eight hundred dollars by  in  the companys cash flow was nearly one billion six hundred million dollars tci and liberty media are today the largest investors in cableprogramming networks by the beginning of this year the number of cable networks had mushroomed to ninetytwo malone serves as chairman of cablelabs in boulder colorado which is the cable industrys center for decoding the future like many of his japanese counterparts and unlike the ceos of most american communications companies malone actually knows how to assemble say a radio because he can ask technical questions and understand the answers and because he has real experience with customers and economics malone may see the future a bit more clearly than his competition does consequently he has been at the forefront of technological advances among them digitalsignal compression which will multiply by ten the number of signals in existing copper wires the ordering of settop boxes from general instrument to convert these digital signals into the analog signals viewed on a normal tv set experiments with mccaw cellular communications to test cellular networks the examining of videoondemand in the denver area with at  t and u s west as partners and the testmarketing of homeenergy information services with microsoft and the pacific gas  electric company it was malone who announced in december of  the advent of something that is now part of the language five hundred channels in the near future by the early nineties senator howard metzenbaum of ohio among other political figures was regularly assailing malone as a monopolist last october malone was invited to testify before metzenbaums subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business rights when he declined saying that he would be travelling overseas republican and democratic senators alike charged that he was arrogant some insisted that he appear when malone did appear in december he suggested that he was being treated unfairly if i relied solely on recent press stories to learn about tci and the role that it plays in the entertainmentandinformation industry i would think that i was dealing with an entity combining the power of the predivestiture at  t ibm when it was the only name in computers and the us postal service before anyone ever heard of ups or federal express he testified the questioning of the witness which attracted a throng of reporters was respectfula spirit enhanced by malones adopting an agreeable pose by letting bell atlantic acquire tci you kind of get rid of me he said although both men would probably be uncomfortable acknowledging it liberals like metzenbaum and conservatives like malone have some common ground in many ways malone and tci do and have done exactly what many liberal critics denounce american corporations for not doing tci thinks longterm and not just about the next quarter it did not fatten its dividends by skimping on research investments although tci enjoys astonishingsome would say excessiveprofit margins of more than forty cents on each dollar of revenue it withholds dividends and instead invests in new ventures the nub of the problems of american business is shortsightedness malone says thats a big difference between here and germany or japan where theres a much longer view and a much longer cycle he believes that most businessmen like most politicians are conformists eager to follow the herd i have an investment mentality rather than a control mentality malone says time warner has a control mentality malone can be both predictable and surprising his political heroes are ronald reagan and dwight eisenhower since he shares their notions about how big government and big taxes sap initiative yet calling himself a libertarian he disagrees with reaganstyle conservatives who want the government to tell a woman that she may not have an abortion malone says he wont spoil his own childrentracy who has a twoyearold daughter lives with her husband in the denver area and evan is a senior at the university of pennsylvaniaby leaving them the billiondollar fortune he has amassed rather he says his will provides them with a financial safety net but not with enough money to rob them of the initiative to work the bulk of the malone estate is earmarked for the creation of a foundation whose purpose will be to invest in education that promotes initiative and free enterprise he can surprise people by saying that the tv networks which he has spent many years assaulting are still attractive properties he is counselling his friend ted turner who would like to buy abc or nbc my guess is that cbs is not long for this world malone says it will probably merge with disney within twelve months barry diller the chairman of qvc network might want to acquire nbc but malone thinks government regulations might prevent this if turner could acquire a network and combine cnn and a network news operation malone guesses that turner could realize two hundred million dollars in savings whether the endeavor would improve news is another matter one impediment he warned turner is that the government might not look kindly on such a deal since malone is turners largest shareholder and is already being accused of monopolistic practices for his proposed merger with bell atlantic despite malones striving for logic his response to certain matters seems to be emotional he repeats the word socialistic like a mantra saying that he picked it up from rush limbaugh whom he applauds for a willingness to say politically incorrect things he uses the term socialistic to berate liberals and even moderates who support government socialwelfare programs he wants nbc cbs and abc to be uprooted from new york so they will be less insular theres a huge diversity of values in this country between what people in central manhattan think of the values of our society and what people in peoria think the values of our society are he says i think manhattan thinks that single parents are fine i think its a much more socialistic world there where the government does everything for you the way malone lives is a surprise preferring privacy to convenience the malones live without servantsno cook no driver their boat has no crew were not socialistic he says this time meaning not elitist in maine we exist we go out to the movies or rent them we go out to dinner by boat in maine when they visit their house in boothbay in winter they watch a lot of movies and iceskate on their oneacre pond in the summer in boothbay malone is up at sunrise each morning and walks the dogs feeds the fish in their pond checks on his apple orchard and vegetable gardens spends an hour in his office reading his email and going through material sent by his colorado office then goes downstairs and makes tea and while he and leslie sip it they gaze out the tall windows and plan the day often he rows two hours to the boatyard when they spend the day on the boat leslie will pack a picnic lunch and the two of them will be off leslie has a studio and sometimes she will spend the day there painting while he putters about in his gardens sometimes they will spend the day visiting antique stores occasionally they will have nonfamily visitorslike the rapleys from denver maybe once a week the tci plane will ferry him to a meeting in new york or elsewhere he has two faxes three phone lines and a video telephone for conferences but he tries to restrict his business to an hour a day no one from the office calls him there says his secretary a cheerful redhaired woman named martha marty flessner in colorado the malones live in a rural area on a hundred acres bordered by a security fence their driveway winds for threeeighths of a mile leading to a comfortable but not opulent house and a barn with three horses though the house is only twenty minutes from the tci offices few who work for tci have ever visited it for leslie malone insists that her husbands personal and business lives be kept separate she wont talk to journalists bob magness says shes a nice lady but admits we dont see them a lot socially even ray smith of bell atlantic who has been negotiating the merger with malone since june and who will become the merged companys chairman says he has never met leslie for a chief executive officer malone has a management style that is curiously indirect he relies on brendan r clouston the chief operating officer of tci to run cable systems and on peter barton the president at liberty media to run programming operations malone himself concentrates on strategy dealmaking technology and cableprogramming brendan is basically the president of the company though we dont call him that yet malone says his spending so much time in maine and declining to attend most operations meetings or to give direct orders lets the organization grow up he says ive sort of worked my way out of a job he has not worked his way out of the job fast enough to suit quite a few people in the cable industry and elsewhere however the criticism of malone and tci amounts essentially to three charges that malone is a ruthless bully that malone is a liar and that malone is a monopolist accounts of tcis coarse tactics are legendary in  when tci and city officials in vail colorado could not agree on cable rates tci pulled all its programming for an entire weekend substituting on tv screens the names and home phone numbers of city officials the city surrendered eight years later in jefferson city missouri tci threatened to let the screen go blank if the city didnt renew its franchise again city officials succumbed a cable competitor filed an antitrust lawsuit against tci and a jury fined malones company thirtysix million dollars keep in mind that in those days there were no rules or laws defining what a cable franchise was malone says of both instances as for jefferson city malone told congress in december that the tci employee responsible was discharged once tci learned of his unauthorized actions and he noted that in  jefferson city had renewed tcis nonexclusive franchise for eleven years the second chargethat malone cant be trustedwas made by martin davis the chief executive officer of paramount in a recent vanity fair account of the battle for paramount between viacom and qvc it is a charge that has also been made by some members of the cable industry his word is useless the ceo of one major cable rival says hes the best businessman i ever met on the other hand in terms of a character trust or honesty evaluation hes one of the most dangerous men i ever met another cableprogramming executive who like most malone critics asks to remain anonymousin his case because his service is one of the twentynine partly owned by malones companiessays that even after you think youve reached an agreement with malone and his people they often reopen negotiations on monday he can say to me i want to invest in this its great  this executive says on wednesday he or peter barton will say i dont think it makes sense  tci another cable operator says has this philosophy i want mine and i want whats not yours ted turner dismisses the criticism that malone is a greedy partner hes a wonderful partner and i say that after seven years or so of having him on my board with veto power over what we do turner says hes been exemplary as a director and as a partner hes as honest as the day is long hes fun to be with malones frequent changes of mind his defenders explain stem from his restless intellect another malone cable partner sees malones mind in a somewhat different perspective defending him as personally honorable but so intellectually adept as to be frightening this is a man who in a twoday period can have four hundred different transactions going on says qvcs barry diller who is a sometimes wary but always respectful partner as someone once said he has a frictionless mind the next idea has no historical relevance he forgets what he said eight minutes before but if you make an agreement you can count on it completely the thirdand potentially most damagingcharge made against malone and tci is that they are a monopoly and use muscle just as the robber barons of the nineteenth century did to gain advantage the claim received new prominence last september when viacom which competes with tci in various programming ventures filed a lawsuit charging that malone had violated the clayton and sherman antitrust acts by maneuvering to deny competitors access to tcis markets the heart of viacoms suit is contained in this passage malones scheme to monopolize cable television begins with his empire of cable television systems malonecontrolled defendants telecommunications inc tci and liberty media corporation liberty have amassed local cable monopolies controlling approximately one in four of all cable households in the united states    defendants monopoly power as cable operators together with their expanding interests in all other aspects of the cable industry gives them unparalleled power to dictate terms to cable television programmers such as viacom without access to malones cable systems cable network programmers cannot achieve the critical mass of viewers needed to attract national advertising or a sufficient number of subscribers required to make the network viable    as a result of malones unique control over this lifeline he canand doesextract unfair and anticompetitive terms and conditions from cable programmers including viacom among the coercive tactics alleged to have been employed by malone perhaps the most serious concerns his relationship with the learning channel back in  this fledging cableprogramming service was put up for sale the lifetime television network which is owned by viacom the hearst corporation and capital cities abc stepped forward ultimately offering thirtynine million dollars sumner redstone the chairman of viacom charges that after lifetimes owners negotiated a sale agreement they went to see malone and he told them he planned to drop the learning channel from many of tcis cable systems as the viacom lawsuit says lifetime then withdrew its bid because of this threat four months later the discovery channel which is partly owned by tci bid thirty million dollars and ended up buying the learning channel one executive who was not a principal in the negotiations but is close to the hearst corporation agrees with redstones claim that malone used inappropriate strongarm tactics but herbert a granath who oversees all cable investments for capital cities abc and who attended a meeting of the three owners of lifetime with malone offers an account of the meeting that while critical is closer to malones version we flew out to see john and said we were willing to turn it into a viable channel and invest more granath recalls but we wouldnt do that unless john agreed to keep it on the air a couple of years he said he could not make that commitment the reason he gave granath was that many of his cable systems had already been told they were free to take on mind extension university and granath says and some had that could be true granath trusts malone he says i never found him untrustworthy he tells you what hes going to do and he does it hes just very tough being tough is not a felony malone says aware that all business executives seek an advantage on behalf of their shareholders i play hardball malone admits but im very direct and i win frequently what happened with the learning channel he says is that it was both a financially and a programmatically weak service at the time and tci to protect itself against the possible bankruptcy of this programming service sent a standard notification to the learning channels principal owners that tci reserved the right to stop carrying the channel many of tcis local franchises never carried the learning channel he says and the learning channel was carrying a lot of infomercials we contracted to distribute mind extension university which we dont own a piece of malone told me when the three partners from lifetime visited he says he told them of his complaints about the quality of programming on the learning channel and of the number of local operators that had already made other choices he also says he offered to reconsider and to pay more if they made the programming first class but they decided not to go forward when discovery bid he says it was the only bidder there has been no shortage of allegations made against malone and tci but they all dance around the same basic question is tci a monopoly here too there seems to be no definitive factual answer redstone says yes others say maybe malone is among those who say no people who say that tci is a defacto monopoly even though it owns only one in four cable boxes predicate the claim on their belief that no programming service could survive without access to malones subscribers malone rejects such notions tci is a large company but we are certainly not a giant whether compared to other telecommunications and technology firms or american companies as a whole he testified before congress in december tcis  revenues including liberty were a little over three billion seven hundred million dollars by comparison at  t and ibm each had  revenues of about sixtyfive billion tci he said was about a quarter the size of time warner the nations secondlargest cablesystem owner it was about a third the size of each of the seven baby bell telephone companies besides he told me he has to operate under federal communications commission guidelines the fcc has ruled that ownership of more than thirty per cent of the nations cable boxes would threaten to become a monopoly and the commission restricts ownership to that limita restriction that malone says is reasonable malone asks if were cutting such a hard deal how come sumner redstone is making so much money the real money in cable he says is being made by programmers like redstone and by hbo espn usa and of course malones liberty media the chief reason that cablesubscription rates have risen sharply in recent years is that programming costs have increased between thirty and fifty per cent annually no one in congress has sat down and looked at it malone says the debate he contends is all about emotion not facts malone is not wailing about his own cash flow which is robustpartly because tci and liberty have bought minority interests in so many programming networks he is simply pointing out that the balance of power belongs to programmers because even if he wanted to he could not deny his subscribers such popular fare as hbo mtv nickelodeon and cnn what redstone wants is to raise prices on his product and i wont resist he says where does the truth lie tci is not a monopoly in the traditional sense after all tci controls only twentyfive per cent of all cable boxes nor even though malone has fought with both redstone and time warner can he easily deny a place on his shelves to such brand names as mtv or hbo which are owned by redstones viacom and time warner respectively malone bridles at being called evil for doing what he believes that most business colleagues would do people ascribe venality to someone who is only acting in his own interest former senator tim wirth told me some part of the criticism of malone is envy some part is not malones company does as he acknowledged play hardball it did remove hbo from some cable systems in texas because we needed to get their attention a tci executive concedes this executive says that tci was losing subscribers and felt that it needed to renegotiate its agreement with hbo it is also true that with the number of channels still limited malone does possess lifeanddeath power over new programmers that have yet to establish themselves for the cable industry he has become the wicked witch it was easy to make malone out as such because he was mysterious he rarely granted long interviews he didnt linger at industry conferences with the boys but instead flew home at night to his family he didnt advertise or pour large sums into political campaigns or retain highpriced publicrelations handlers or lobbyists he didnt court members of congress or the executive branch he played rough he remained a loner he maintained a naive faith in the power of his argument in logic even though he had no faith in the logic of washington or the media the attacks on malone mounted there were anonymous physical threats malone says he hired security guards for leslie and for his children his hair which had been almost black turned gray leslie malone became agitated she couldnt sleep malone says for she worried about her children was enraged that her husband could be equated with darth vader leslie pressed him to leave tci to devote more time to the familyto strike a better balance between family and business last fall when malone couldnt shake a persistent flu his doctor said your immune system is depressed your health problem is stress whenever malone thought about washington he felt more stress a democratic government was in the white house malones old nemesis al gore was now vicepresident malone respected gores knowledge of telecommunications but not his politics he was no longer sure what the government would permit would it allow him to run both a cable system tci and a programming company liberty media or would it compel him to divest would it allow him to make more deals portrayed by his foes as allpowerful malone actually felt powerless to stop the freight train he saw barrelling down the tracks toward him and tci the uncertainty altered malone it made him more tentative malones confidence that cable could be king was also shaken the telephone goliath loomed larger in his mind he believed that the clintongore administration would unshackle the telephone companies hastening the day when the seven baby bells and at  t and the other longdistance carriers would be allowed to carry video on their wires thus challenging cable without unshackling cable companies so they could enter the phone business he knew that balance sheets were not cables friend the cash flow of the entire cable industry is one and a half times the size of one baby bell he has said more than once huge amounts of capital would be required to build an information superhighwayto lay the fibreoptic wire to invest in programming to fill five hundredplus channels to order the highspeed switches and settop boxes that would let viewers call up a movie or a sporting event instantly on their video jukeboxes or interact on their computer network the cable industry alone didnt have the capital nor did it have the capital to fulfill malones longtime dream of opening a second front by challenging the baby bells in the telephone business critics said that malone was too big he thought tci was too small it would be a seven or eightfront battle for us malone told metzenbaums subcommittee in december eighteen months ago i started telling bob magness and the board that i felt we had to do a strategic deal with a phone company or we were going to have serious problems longterm malone says to go into the phone business alone he felt would risk too much of their capital his first preference he says was a strategic partnership with at  t in which tci could draw on at  ts capital and technologycould remain independent while having a big brother there were many meetings and discussions between malone and at  t malone sat on the board of mccaw the largest cellularphone company and was aware that that company was about to merge with at  t together the three of them could compete against the baby bellsor cable for that matterin providing wired or wireless services but such a joint venture would require government approval and that was uncertain besides malone says at  t feared that if government deregulated the phone business too fast the baby bells would challenge at  ts longdistance business before at  t was ready to challenge their local phone business craig mccaw the chairman and ceo of mccaw cellular suggested that malone get better acquainted with ray smith of bell atlantic whose headquarters are in arlington virginia malone had already met smith while appearing on an industry panel with him and malone had visited bell atlantic two years before and dined with smith in may of  they had become partners in a satellite programming service in new zealand malone admired smiths courage in challenging in federal court government prohibitions that kept telephone companies out of the video business smith claimed that the prohibitions were tantamount to a denial of free speech and in may of  he won his case bell atlantics balance sheet impressed malone for in  the company generated revenues of more than twelve billion dollars had relatively little debt and produced net income of a billion three hundred million dollars as a ceo with more than thirtythree years in a governmentregulated monopoly where customers and profits were assured smith impressed malone with his entrepreneurial attitude malone noted that bell atlantic was running the kind of slim headquarters organization he himself favored it was clear to both of us that we saw the world similarly malone says there was a bonus with smith and it was one that mattered to malone smith was a skilled politician he was on a firstname basis with leading washington figures he liked dealing with the press he was used to having a publicrelations employee sit in during press interviewssomething that malone didnt do unbeknownst to malone at the time smith too was searching for a partner he had four reasons to target tci as his top choice the first he said recently in his arlington office was that it had national coverage and the second was that it was situated in a number of major markets then there was john malone he went on johns understanding of the business and his skill at handling programmingthat was the third aspect of it the fourth tci had very good cash flows smith phoned malone and asked if he might pay him a visit they met in tcis boardroom on june   instead of getting right to the point which was that he wanted to propose a partnership between the two companies smith recalls he started by talking about their common visionabout how as he is fond of saying the superhighway means that your computer will speak your tv will listen and your telephone will show you pictures smith spoke of how he was leading a cultural revolution at bell atlantic encouraging managers to be more nimbleto be more like tci and in the future they like tci would plow profits back into expanding his business he spoke of how each of them imagined cable and telephone slugging it out and joked about their sparring sessions on various panels then he got serious do you think youll be able to do this yourself of course malone had said but then he quickly retreated smith goes on he made it clear he could learn everything but it would be a lot faster if he had someone who understood switching regulation operating systems and service requirementsthe stuff that we do very well smith then suggested a strategic partnership the chemistry with ray was terrific malone says the other guys are old school there is no way companies like u s west would walk away from dividends ray was clearly a cat of a different color very entrepreneurial hes a delightful guy hes not the stiff threepiece suit he also plays hardball just as malone does although smith was equally impressed with malone he says he wanted to leave malone with one other message which was he says if we did not succeed in partnering with tci we were going to partner with someone else the meeting ended with smith saying ill write you a letter tomorrow within days malone received a fourpage letter it asked that he consider three options bell atlantic could make a small minority investment in tci much as u s west did when it invested two billion five hundred million in time warner or it could take a larger minority stake supplying more capital but without gaining control or finally the two companies could merge smith also sent a confidentiality agreement which both men would sign malone was interested it was the right thing for tci to take option no  and merge he felt and it was the right thing for leslie and john malone he didnt want to run all or part of a large organization earlier in the year when ibm had been scouting for a new ceo its search committee visited malone and asked if he might consider becoming ceo of the computer giant im at the point in my life where i dont want to run a large organization he recalls telling the committee im not good at it im a builder i like to invent leslie malone desperately wanted her husband out of the public eye he says that at one point he imagined taking liberty media and riding off into the sunset les was real happy with that he says she likes peter peter barton an ebullient man of fortytwo is one of the few tci employees who have been inside either of the malone homes malone envisioned staying on as the chairman of liberty media with barton running it still though malone liked that scheme he was uncertain what to do about the rest of tci as it happened two previously scheduled business conferencesa meeting of the national cable television association in lenox massachusetts on july th followed by an annual ceo retreat in sun valley idahohelped crystallize malones thoughts the twelveseat tci canadair challenger jet picked him up in maine and stopped in lenox where he stayed just half a day ranking cable executives were there with their spouses im feeling like a left thumb wondering why im there malone recalls at  pm he headed for sun valley pulled out a yellow legal pad and began making notes at the top of page  he wrote john and leslies goals and objectives and then he listed six  to reduce stress  to have more fun  to insure a safe and liquid personal investment portfolio  to generate predictable income to fund their life style  to reduce government and legal and media exposure by taking himself out of the public eye  to honor commitments and moral obligations to his family and business associates these goals in turn led to a set of conclusions which malone also jotted down  to retire from tci  to reduce outside public board memberships from eleven to four  to remain chairman and controlling shareholder in liberty and stay as chairman of cablelabs  to remain on the turner board because it was fun and because it was an important programming investment for tci and would allow him to maintain my relationships with the old gang  to get the government off our back  to generate predictable income by deferring tci compensation payments which with stock dividends should produce sufficient cash to maintain their life style  to say nothing publicly about the contemplated change until bob magness was comfortable magness who is sixtynine and spends less and less time in the office had been kept abreast of malones search for a partner the next step was to bring magness and smith together a dinner was arranged in new york on july th sharon and bob magness malone brendan clouston and tcis outside attorney jerome kern of baker  botts would greet smith and a few of his key executives at an apartment that tci maintains in manhattan the purpose of the evening was to see whether magness was as comfortable with smith and bell atlantic as malone was smith acted like the suitor he was before going to dinner he talked about the benefits of joining the two companies into one giant and he made it clear in his gentle way that if they were to merge he wanted liberty to be part of the deal smith knew he needed programs to fill his cornucopia of digitalized channels he wanted liberty he wanted tci people he wanted the same kind of entrepreneurial culture that magness and malone had helped inspire most of all he wanted malone his brain and his cachet on wall street they walked to a restaurant and there the discussion revolved around the state of the communications industry when the two groups parted after nearly five hours bob magness was sold on smith and bell atlantic i was very comfortable with them magness recalls malone was comfortable with bell atlantic yet uncomfortable with the thought that he might not be able to go off with liberty they were getting into a business they didnt know well he later said of bell atlantic and they were afraid id outsmart them and they would buy obsolete stuff and id keep the good stuff this is where my reputation hurt me a few days after the dinner malone telephoned smith i agree with youwe should merge the two companies smith recalls malone saying and that means liberty and tci right smith wasnt sure what role malone wanted to play in the merged company he was sure that he not malone would be the ceo i felt that i was the better person to run the combined company he says having the larger company having the experience in regulation and he knew that malone had no interest in being ceo so he wasnt surprised when malone said on the phone you should run the whole thing with the bell atlantic deal sliding along nicely malone knew that it would complicate if not sabotage an earlier deal he had made to own twentytwo per cent of qvc and to be partners with barry diller and ralph and brian roberts the father and son who are respectively chairman and president of comcast when they announced their partnership in december of  they had said that diller would do more than build a homeshopping service he would become cable televisions programming maestro for the superhighway he and malone and comcast together would bend the future to cables will now three impediments had presented themselves first malone had been told in midsummer that diller wanted to make an offer to acquire paramount and malone now says that that offer conflicted with discussions he had been holding which were meant to facilitate a link between turner broadcasting and paramount second if the merger with bell atlantic went forward malone would be unilaterally altering the nature of his partnership with diller and the robertses and finally he would be aligning tci with a phone company that wanted to enter the cable business and would be poised to challenge comcast since comcast had cable boxes throughout much of bell atlantics region mindful of his confidentiality agreement and of the possibility of subsequent shareholder suits malone said nothing to diller or to the robertses when diller proposed to the qvc board members that they make an unsolicited bid for paramount malone recused himself he has stated in a sworn deposition telling diller and the board that it was inappropriate for me to put myself in a position where tcis discussions ongoing discussions with paramount would be in conflict with something that qvc and the qvc board might want to do malone says that he had discussions with martin davis of paramount for at least three years about paramounts merging with turner broadcasting this idea sank over social issues malone says teds attitude was maybe i can let marty stick around a couple of years before i get rid of him and marty wanted ted to sell advertising as late as last april malone now says he received a proposal from davis to link but not merge paramount and turner and liberty each would own a piece of each other but retain its own independence davis and turner would continue to run their own empires and liberty would own more than twenty per cent of paramount to go along with its nearly twentyfivepercent ownership of turner malone says that he still had hopes of pulling off such a deal when diller proposed going after paramount since malone continually explores possible deals he was still talking to davis through the summer malone said in his deposition that davis had repeatedly asked whether diller was coming after him and demanded that malone put diller on a leash there have been conflicting interpretations of malones behavior friends maintain that he was trying to strike a delicate balance between his partners and his own shareholders since he honestly believed that his earlier proposal for paramount was better than dillers he did recuse himselfthat is until davis chose viacom as a partner in september detractors say that malones behavior in regard to paramount is one more example of why he cant be trusted whichever camp one falls into this much is certain even when malone recused himself he had a strategy he was guessing that the threat from diller might drive davis into malones arms to some observers it seemed to be another case of i want mine and i want whats not yours unlike the discussions with turner or the subsequent negotiations between sumner redstone and martin davis as they have been recounted in the voluminous depositions that all sides gave the socalled social issues between malone and smithsuch as who would be ceo which company name would be listed first and what titles would be conferredwere quickly resolved that summer they agreed that smith would run the company that the tci name would not be part of the new entity and that malone would serve as a kind of consultant based in denver and would shepherd strategy programming and technology conceptually we were aligned malone says the real issue came down to price on august th smith and his team flew to portland maine to meet malone and his team and take malones boat out to sea once on board they wrestled much of the day over price one of the issues was malone and magnesss insistence that they be paid a tenpercent premium for their class b stock malone maintained that this was not unusual bob feels strongly that he is giving up control and ought to get a premium he told smith bell atlantic was asking malone and magness to agree not to sell their stock for five years and was asking malone to sign a noncompete clause preventing him from working elsewhere in the industry for a number of years malone and magness wanted something in return no definitive agreement was reached but in coming weeks smith embraced the tenpercent premium as fair and since this had always been seen as a stockforstock swap they agreed on a method for determining the dollar value of tcis shares however as is often true with malone until a letter of intent was signed he kept tinkering on the morning of october th the day before the marriage was publicly announced both parties met at the manhattan law office of skadden arps slate meagher  flom which was representing bell atlantic they negotiated until  pm smith recalls they haggled over pricehow to value each of the components of the deal including liberty medias programming investments i was ready to walk away smith says when they finally settled these matters and were in separate rooms drafting statements to be included in a press release distributed the next day they had forgotten one important detail smith remembers that malone entered the room to say my guys tell me i have to have a title what do you want smith asked they say vicechairman  ok smith said to smith this was the ultimate demonstration that neither of us has position ego he says we dont care about where we sit or about titles malone doesnt care about titles others say he cares about control at tci magness had the title and malone had control though senator metzenbaum and others reacted with alarm to the prospect of malone at the nerve center of a behemoth that now reached into twentythree per cent of american homes the reaction from the clinton administration was muted the emerging consensus in washington is that as long as the wires are open to any programmer the merger encourages competition by provoking warfare between cable and telephone companies and thus inviting two or more wires into most homes malone and smith remain uncertain about what the federal regulatory bodies will do they know they face a wait of about a year before the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission and the justice department rule on the merger when malone spoke to tci employees at a videotaped questionandanswer session right after the october merger announcement he himself did not sound like an employee keep in mind for those of you who feel bought or traded that the two largest shareholders of the new bell atlantic are going to be the two largest shareholders of liberty and tcithats bob magness and me he said in a tug of war id bet on our managers and he made it clear tci did not sell out we got married in january when malone spoke to his managers at a denver hotel he guessed that there was a seventy per cent likelihood that the deal happens why so low a percentage because he has said since the government might object to the marriage or insist that the new company shed assets that bell atlantic would not want to shed perhaps he says now the complexity of the details to be settled between the two partiesas of last week a definitive merger agreement had yet to be signedcould prompt one or both to back away if the deal should collapseand malone does not believe that this will happenhe is currently telling his managers that he would give up on the idea of a similar merger instead tci would go back to square one and look for a strategic partner with bell atlantic being his first choice if that happened malone might slip off with peter barton and liberty media and what of malones former partners comcast and qvc they were unhappy because the proposed merger with bell atlantic would mean that the federal trade commission would require liberty to divest itself of its stake in qvcif that is the homeshopping service should capture paramount to stay in the bidding contest with viacom diller and comcast scurried to find new investors if diller loses paramount malone will remain as their partnerunless the federal government should veto that arrangement no matter what happens malones present or former partners are apprehensive overnight comcast went from being a partner of malones to being a competitor im not saying john shouldnt have done the deal a cable rival says but there was no emotion this guy is a machine comcasts president brian roberts who brokered the original partnership between diller and malone still professes admiration for malones abilities but he does not camouflage some hurt i was disappointed on several levels he said john was not upfront that he was talking to a phone company and might sell his company yet we were in the middle of a tenbilliondollar deal for paramount that relied heavily on him you can argue that bell atlantic was a thirtythreebilliondollar deal and he didnt want to risk it by telling us but he could have indicated that something was up without revealing any details deep in my heart i say he didnt trust usor perhaps anyoneenough to take a chance malone and smith maintain that if malone had told diller and roberts earlier than october th which is when malone called them it would have violated securities and exchange commission regulations we didnt make the deal till the last minute smith says john had to swallow the discomfort    we had agreed to that i had a partner who was totally shockedgrupo iusacell a mexican cellulartelephone company in which bell atlantic had announced just two days before that it had acquired a billiondollar stake malone says that he has committed himself not just to carrying on his cable systems the two basic qvc channels but to opening the systems up to more when qvc expands he also says that if diller should need investment dollars to sweeten his bid for paramount he was prepared to consider advancing him five hundred million dollars as part of a joint venture they could do overseas the fraying partnership between malone roberts and diller may be a harbinger of the mercenary nature of business alliances in an era when communications companies are scrambling to converge malone says he feels regret that his relationship with brian and ralph roberts has been altered we have great relations with comcast he says we have been partners in many deals together he once invited the robertses on his boatan unusual move for malone of diller malone says hes probably the most professional businessman i ever met he blends sensitivity and toughness in a way that you rarely find i regret that i have not been able to be of counsel to barry to the degree i had hoped but malone is not looking back in the future he says business relationships will get more complicated virtually everybody who is not on your team or in your company will be both a friend and a competitor he observes were partners with time warner on a whole bunch of stuff yet we are also competitors he competes with nbc but also has business dealings with it he will seek to invest not in any one hollywood studio but in several he says so as not to be just a renter of software if you have crossinvestment it increases the likelihood that your purposes are aligned he explains he does not want to own a studio outright its like racing horses or owning a ball team malone says of the movie business theres too much ego in it to be a business today tci has an equity stake in turner broadcasting which has bought two small independent hollywood studios and the mgm library it has a joint payperview venture with rupert murdochs twentieth century fox malone retains a relationship with diller if qvc should fail to take over paramount and he has been talking to both sony and mca about joint investments malones game plan has never wavered he wants a piece of everyones business he says malone believes that companies have no permanent allies only permanent interests such an approach both enhances malones flexibility and constricts it alliances rest on business logic not personal loyalty or shared passions there is no fellowbusinessman malone says with whom hed rather kick off his shoes and strategize than rupert murdoch yet so aware is he that murdoch is also a competitorhis fox network competes with malones cable channels and his sky television news service challenges cnnthat malone says he is always a bit guarded everyone in business is both friend and enemy no one is either because malones brains and his cunning are widely admired speculation in the business and media worlds has it that malone must know something denied everyone else maybe he has figured out that the superhighway and its five hundredplus channels will not be successful maybe he has discovered that the cable industry is a dinosaur maybe malone made a deal with the government maybe malone is keeping liberty or other assets or maybe business week suggested it will just turn out that malone will quickly start to chafe at his secondary role but maybe this time the complicated malone is simply following his heart not his head maybe for once hes following human not business logic maybe hes doing what the wall street mutualfund legend peter lynch did in  at the age of fortysix which was to step down in order to spend time with his family maybe one can take malone at his word when he says that although he had multiple motives for merging with bell atlantic his overriding motive had nothing to do with business he was putting his wife and family first hes not about to retire he says explaining i want to spend more time with my wife my children and my granddaughter in order to participate in their lives to a very large degree this bell atlantic deal is a conclusion to me personally ray can make the speeches hes better at it than i am and he likes to do it i can spend a lot more time with les and the kids and still be sufficiently involved to keep my intellect and my creative side occupied the promised land what he was asked would he say to someone who thought the toughguy malone sounded henpecked malone did not shift uncomfortably in his office chair did not move his hands did not act as if he were under assault his eyes never flickered from the questioner as he responded call it what you will its not that she is beating on me all the time its something i feel the feeling he continued was that he had not honored the deal i made when i married her he was also being selfish he said when im in maine im a different person i smile i sleep well im more fun whatever malones personal motives may be its commonly assumed that ray smith will not be lonely running the merged tcibell atlantic for many people believe that the fish has swallowed the whale soon after the merger brian roberts marvelled of malone think how smart he is heres a guy whose company the federal government was thinking of breaking up on one day because he was too powerful and the next day he has tripled the size of his business and the government appears to like it since malone will be fiftythree in march people cant believe that he is truly stepping down tim wirth says of malones biggest deal i wonder who this guy from bell atlantic is hes in for a

lawrence meyers june   at  investinginvesting in stocksstock market todaytechnology stocks john malone with his attorney kevin abrams john randolphreuterslandovhave john malone’s investments outshone those of the stock market guru most investors have probably not heard of dr john malone  his background begins at the famous bell labs at att in the rd department  in the late s he joined legendary management consultant firm mckinsey  co  he burst onto the scene of the cable television industry in its infancy when cable pioneer bob magness hired malone to be the ceo of the growing telecommunications inc there he proceeded to pioneer innovations and growth initiatives that effectively made the cable industry what it is today  liberty media was a spinoff of tci that malone controlled he has since leveraged his knowledge and experience into many other disciplines resulting in one of the greatest investment portfolios of all time john malone has several core principles  he looks for operating synergies so that merging companies are able to benefit as a combined entity  he likes to spinoff businesses so that their value can be unlocked  john malone is wellversed in tax law so he is able to avoid diluting his and shareholder value via taxation john malone either installs great ceos at companies he buys or like warren buffett leaves great management in place  he knows how to manage debt so as to use it to his maximum advantage while not placing the underlying business at risk of default  he also sits on the board of many companies he buys he tends to favor businesses with lots and lots of cash flow like carl icahn can once icahn turns them around  he uses that cash flow to repurchase stock so as to enhance shareholder value unlike buffett or to draw down lowcost debt to further finance growth malone’s central entity liberty media has had multiple tracking stocks over the years  if you want to invest alongside him i’d suggest you buy each of the tracking stocks because i think they are all great buys  you can also buy shares of companies he purchases  for now let’s examine his tracking stocks liberty media corporation nasdaqlmca liberty media corporation nasdaqlmca holds positions in a number of wellknown companies including but not limited to the atlanta braves  true position  charter communications nasdaq chtr  live nation entertainment nyselyv  macneillehrer productions  sirius xm nasdaqsiri  and small percentages in other companies  these assets have a value of roughly  billion and lowcost debt amounting to  billion the best way to evaluate any liberty stock is not by earnings per share but by consistent adjusted ebitda or cash flow liberty media’s cash flow typically runs between  million and  million quarterly or  billion and  billion annually at a stock price of  the stock trades at an evebitda ratio of  a very reasonable number considering the company’s assets liberty interactive nasdaqlinta liberty interactive

interactive stock typically sees adjusted operating income in the  –  million range quarterly  it trades at  or at an evebitda ratio of  even less than its peer liberty ventures nasdaqlvnta liberty ventures nasdaqlvnta is yet another tracking stock  it holds positions in a bunch of public companies including expedia nasdaqexpe interval leisure group nasdaqiilg treecom nasdaqtree and tripadvisor nasdaqtrip  the stock is a spinoff of liberty interactive but its financials are embedded within its predecessor that by the way is the price you pay of owning malone stock  the financials can be hard to keep track of and many of them keep splitting into other stocks  it’s difficult to compile his exact returns over the years in all his businesses  however what we do know is that his investment in telecommunications inc resulted in a  return his  investment in struggling preferred shares of sirius xm is now worth  billion his investment in directv nysedtv turned  billion into  billion – the
