legg  kornfeld oklahoma city okl for appellants johnnie m walters asst atty gen joseph m howard bennet n hollander and william s estabrook attys tax div dept of justice on the brief for appellee before lewis chief judge and mcwilliams and doyle circuit judges william e doyle circuit judge this is an action in which the plaintiffsappellants sought an income tax refund in the amount of  growing out of an assessed deficiency for the taxable year  the item in dispute is tax assessed on what purports to be an interest payment to western security life insurance company the taxpayers deducted this interest in the amount of  the commissioner disallowed the interest deduction whereupon this action was commenced the tax court upheld the commissioner thus determining that the interest deduction was not proper under  usc § a  the case before us revolves around the issuance on january   by western security life insurance company to the golsens life insurance in the face amount of  consisting of twenty executive special policies each having a face amount of  and an effective date of december   they named jack e golsen as insured and mrs golsen as beneficiary their three children are contingent beneficiaries the executive special policies appeared on their faces to be whole life policies providing for aggregate premiums of  a year for the first twenty years and  a year thereafter the executive special policies implemented an insurance program embodying the following principal elements  the insured first borrowed from western the entire amount of the first year cash value which he used simultaneously to pay the greater part of the first years premium  he at the same time borrowed a much larger sum from western with most of the proceeds of the loan he simultaneously established a socalled prepaid premium fund in the amount of the present value of the aggregate annual premiums for the following four years discounted at an annual rate of three percent western undertook to pay interest on the prepaid premium fund at the rate of three percent a year and that fund when supplemented by the interest increments paid by western were sufficient at each of the next four anniversary dates of policies to pay the annual aggregate premium of   at the beginning of the first year the insured simultaneously paid in advance that years four percent interest on the sums he had borrowed  as the prepaid premium fund was reduced each year thereafter by the purported payment of premiums therefrom for such year the insured was in turn to replenish the fund by a prepayment in respect of the premiums to become due four years thereafter the amount thus added to the fund each year was  which at three percent compound interest was expected to increase to  four years thereafter and accordingly be sufficient to pay the premiums falling due at that time  each year after the issuance of the policies the insured would borrow the full amount of the increase in the loan value of the policies for that year and he would simultaneously use part of the proceeds of such loan to pay the full amount of  to be added to the prepaid premium fund and would use the balance to pay part of the annual interest charges on his growing indebtedness to western  after the first year no part of the insureds outofpocket costs would be allocable to premiums and as a consequence of treating the interest as deductible the insureds actual cost of the insurance purchased by him would either be comparatively nominal or result in a net profit to him the insured was never to be personally liable on any of his loans and the policies would never in fact have any cash surrender value as a result of the loans the table which is set forth below shows the approximate figures as to some of the more important elements of golsens life insurance program  as each years  premium is paid out of the prepaid premium fund the cash or loan value of the policy increases and the value of the death benefit increases in fact examination of column  indicates that the cash value increases by an increasing amount which after the third policy year exceeds the amount of the  annual premium whether these substantial amounts of cash value increases are due to an amount of implicit interest paid to the policyholder on the cash value on deposit with the insurance company was not determined by the tax court the tax court did determine that  the socalled annual premium on the executive special policies was set at an artificially high level so as to create an abnormally high cash value in order to facilitate or make possible the purported lending transaction    golsen v commr  tc  at  filed april   in any event golsen did not declare as income or pay taxes on any portion of the increases in cash value over and above the amount of his premium payments nor did he declare as income or pay taxes on any of the  percent annual interest which the insurance company paid on the prepaid premium fund yet he was able to borrow each year against the full amount of both funds and of course he deducted the amount of interest which he paid on these loans golsens annual loans in the amounts of the cash value increases shown in column  above were just sufficient to replenish the prepaid premium fund and to pay approximately half of the interest charges on his loans column  thus his outofpocket expenses were also approximately onehalf of his socalled interest charges and the tax savings realized by deducting the interest charges against his other income were assuming a  percent tax bracket just enough to generally offset the amount of his outofpocket expenses it is also no coincidence that golsens annual outofpocket expense or net cash flow was found by the tax court to be merely the amount that was actuarially required to pay for or support the insurance benefits available under the policies when stripped of their cash surrender values id at  it was upon this basis that the tax court found that in reality  such interest payments in fact represent the cost to the insured of the insurance benefits provided by the executive special policies under the prearranged plan and do not represent payment for the use of borrowed funds  thus the tax court found that the superstructure of loans and interest payments surrounding the basic insurance transaction was sham and lacked economic substance and that therefore the interest payments did not qualify as deductions pursuant to  usc § a as payment for the use of borrowed funds we agree with the tax court that the loan and interest transactions involved with this insurance plan lacked economic substance the loan and interest transactions have no purpose other than the conversion of payments for insurance coverage into interest payments for tax purposes as stated by the tax court golsens loans were secured solely by the policies themselves and the socalled premium prepayment fund without any personal liability on his part the loans could be cancelled at any time without any cash payment merely by appropriate offsetting book entries and the full amount of the socalled premium prepayment fund was in fact thus charged off on westerns books on january   accompanied by a corresponding entry reducing golsens indebtedness by the amount allocable to such fund in denying the golsens claim for refund the tax court held that it was bound by the decision of this court in goldman v united states  fd  th cir  because the appeal from the tax courts decision could only be brought in this court in goldman we considered an insuranceloan program which was written by the same company western security and which had attributes similar to those present in the instant case involved were interest payments to western security which as here exceeded the rate paid by the insurance company on the surrender value it was the interest transaction which was the predominant aspect and which led this court to conclude  fd at  the policy itself clearly reflects that the interest on the loans was  and the annual yield or increase in policy value was at the rate of  the annual loss of  when the record reveals the taxpayer was not pressed for cash indicates a lack of economic substance in these transactions the court in goldman was guided by the decision of the supreme court in knetsch v united states  us   s ct   l ed d   in which the insurance program was devoid of substance there it was said    for it is patent that there was nothing of substance to be realized by knetsch from this transaction beyond a tax deduction what he was ostensibly lent back was in reality only the rebate of a substantial part of the socalled interest payments the  difference retained by the company was its fee for providing the facade of loans whereby the petitioners sought to reduce their  and  taxes in the total sum of  there may well be single premium annuity arrangements with nontax substance which create an indebtedness for the purposes of § b of the  code and § a of the  code but this one is a sham the tax court rejected campbell v centex  fd  th cir  which it also deemed to be directly in point  despite some rather feeble attempts on the part of each side herein to distinguish the case adverse to it    we agree that we are bound by our goldman decision in this case to the small extent that goldman and centex are possibly distinguishable the considerations go against the golsens appellants contend that goldman and centex are distinguishable inasmuch as in goldman no business purpose was found while in centex the fifth circuit found that centex inc the corporation had procured the insurance policies to assist in meeting the obligations of centex under its deferred compensation plan and its obligations under the stock option and redemption agreement as well as for the general objective of having insurance upon its key employees and stockholders    assuming arguendo that this distinction would make a difference golsens purpose of protecting his family from his personal indebtedness on business debts of corporations does not qualify as a business purpose in the same manner as centex incs purpose see also priester machinery co v united states  f supp  wd tenn  wherein the business purpose was to cushion the corporation in the event of its presidents death and to facilitate the making of business loans appellants also contend that centex is distinguishable from goldman in that centex found economic substance in the insurance transaction because the net death benefits under the policy were substantial and increased from year to year appellant argues that after subtracting all loans against the policies the net death benefits were substantial in amount under the policies in both centex and this case while in goldman they were not an examination of the district court opinion in goldman however goldman v united states  f supp  wd okla  does not bear this out regardless however of whether the insurance coverage as such may have had some value we are of the opinion that the superimposed loan transactions had no economic substance and hence the interest deduction must fail  one final argument advanced by appellant is that the loan transaction itself or a part thereof took advantage of a loophole in the tax law which was clearly recognized by the internal revenue service and which was not plugged until  the  percent discount element of the prepaid premium deposit fund was until late in  considered as nontaxable  and there should not therefore be any reason to believe that the full  percent interest paid on money borrowed against that fund should not be deductible however this was all true in goldman in which no economic substance was found we are not disposed to overrule that decision it is true that when congress plugged the loophole involved here it assumed that the law allowed such deductions the revenue act of  amended §  of the internal revenue code of  to read in part as follows a general rule no deduction shall be allowed for —        except as provided in subsection c any amount paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry a life insurance    contract    pursuant to a plan of purchase which contemplates the systematic direct or indirect borrowing of part or all of the increases in the cash value of such contract either from the insurer or otherwise    paragraph  shall apply only in respect to contracts purchased after august   the house ways and means committee report interpreted then existing law as follows    under present law no interest deductions are denied where the taxpayer purchases an insurance contract with the intention of borrowing the maximum amount on the contract each year unless the contract falls in one of the categories described above  however we are not bound by congress interpretation of prior existing law the fact however that congress considered it expedient to remedy an avoidance device which had at least some court recognition does not bind us in dealing with a specific fact situation the judgment of the tax court is affirmed   the essence of the decision of the tax court was first that the complex of loans from western to the insured in connection with the insurance policies issued on his life were sham and as such were designed first to pay for bare insurance coverage and secondly to give to the appellants an interest deduction which would serve to pay for this coverage the court found that the loans were not binding obligations that they were subject to cancellation which merely required offsetting debits and credits on westerns books the tax court determined that it was bound to follow this courts decision in goldman v united states  fd  th cir  and that goldman was exactly in point        increase in borrowing remaining cash cash value used to pay value available outofpocket from preceding discounted for pmt of interest year premium interest payments expenses                                                                                                       these amounts which are added to the total cash value balance each year are available for borrowing each year by the insured   golsen v commr  tc  the court based this conclusion upon the testimony of an actuary who established to the courts satisfaction that the receipt and prepayment agreement and the loan agreement and assignment of policy has no essential relationship whatever to the insurance benefits provided under the insurance contracts that when in accordance with the prearranged plan the policy was stripped of its artificially high cash surrender values such policy was merely the equivalent of renewable term insurance and that actuarially the net cash which the insured in fact paid to the insurance company however described merely represented the true cost of the insurance purchased id at    see ballagh v united states  fd   ct cl   cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   wherein the court stated at  plaintiff is wide of the mark in supposing that his primary purpose of providing retirement income can make valid what would otherwise be a sham for the transaction which we find to be a sham is not the initial insurance contract but the prepayment of all of the premiums and the loan agreement we do not question that plaintiffs motive in buying the policy was a legitimate one however the subsequent prepayment of all premiums by borrowing from the insurance company itself was not necessary in so providing retirement income and we find that such loan transaction did not appreciably affect his beneficial interest except to reduce his tax see also minchin v commissioner of

year results we will be available to answer your questions about the business for more detailed information about the company we refer you to our k if any call participants have questions about the nature of our businesses we would be happy to send you information upon request  results for sales and earnings exceeded our expectations and both set an all time record we also made major improvement to our balance sheet and net worth consolidated sales in  were  million up  over  sales of  million net income to common shares in  was  at  million of   million for the year  fully diluted earnings were  per common share compared to  in  please keep in mind there were some special items in quarter  and to a lesser extent in quarter  which tony will cover even without these special items earnings were dramatically better than in  in the fourth quarter of  sales increased  over  those numbers were  million compared to  million and our net income was  million compared to  million in  after deducting preferred stock dividends in  net income common stock was  million for  compared  million in  tony will also go into more detail about these numbers later in this conference call overall our core businesses were very strong in  in our climate control business we saw new incoming orders lag in the fourth quarter but they have rebounded strongly so far in the first quarter of  we remain optimistic about our long term growth prospects we have bucked many past economic downturns by intensifying our sales and marketing efforts and focusing on renovation and promotion our energy efficient products at this time we believe that we are in the right spot with our energy savings and green products which are part of the solution to the country’s quest for energy independence we continue to dominate the niche markets we serve as our market share of key products continues growing over the long term we expect specific markets that we are in to continue to grow and we expect to grow with them recently we contracted to acquire additional acreage for future expansion of both our geothermal and fan coil manufacturing facilities and as we have said many times in these past these decisions that we’ve made are for the long term benefit of our shareholders barry will update you on climate control later in this call the outlook for our chemical business is strong based on the world supply demand fundamentals regarding grain stocks driving demand for fertilizers in recent months we were able to take advantage of excellent spot pricing in the ag sector of our business because of this we are applying for permits to start up our pryor oklahoma plant although we have not made the final decision to start this plant yet if we go ahead with this project lead time for start up is approximately  to  months as an additional item yesterday our board of directors authorized the company to buy back shares and we will be making a press release regarding this in the immediate future now i’ll turn this call over to barry and tony we will go over our financial condition in more specific numbers and details about our businesses barry h golsen yesterday morning we issued our earnings release for the fourth quarter and for the calendar year  and we plan to file the k tomorrow for the fourth quarter ended  of  as compared to the fourth quarter of  lsb’s consolidated sales were  million compared to  million in  an  increase operating income was  million compared to  million last year an increase of  pretax income was  million compared to  million income tax provision was  million compared to  net income was  million or  full diluted compared to  million or  per diluted share and after allocating corporate costs the fourth quarter ebitda was  million compared to  million last year an increase of  let me mention at this point regarding the income tax provision on the financial statements we began the year with a federal nol tax carry forward that was for the most part consumed by earnings in  we are carrying only  million of that nol into  and as a result it will fully tax effect our financial results in  i will explain the fourth quarter income tax provision of  million later in this presentation it’s somewhat confusing and has generated a few questions so i’ll explain that in more detail later as a point of information and as disclosed in our press release yesterday the fourth quarter of  earnings include  million of pretax income related to a business insurance recovery of  million which was included as a reduction of cost of sales and also by a  million unamortized debt issuance cost which is included in interest expense that was written off as a result of the early payoff of a  million term loan in november of  for the full year of  as compared to  lsb’s sales were  million or  higher than  million last year operating income more than doubled to  million compared to  million pretax income was  million compared to  million in  the provision for income tax was  million compared to  in  net income was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share last year and after allocating corporate costs ebitda rose  to  million compared to  million last year an increase of  million and consistent what i just mentioned in the fourth quarter as a point of information and as disclosed in our press release yesterday that calendar  earnings includes  million of pretax income which is inclusive of the  million that we just talked about the  million included a litigation settlement of  million that was included in other income it included a business interruption insurance recovery of  million which was included in chemicals as a reduction of their cost of sales and as i just mentioned offset by the  million unamortized debt issuance cost that’s included in interest expense relative to the other payoff of the  million term loan let’s talk about the tax provision which is fairly complicated and is explained in great detail in footnote  of the k that you’ll be able to take a look tomorrow so i’m going to try to summarize it in conversational terms as opposed to technical terms our effective tax rate for the calendar year  was fairly insignificant due to the reversal again in  of the valuation allowances on the net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets available at the beginning of the year the financial income tax provision of  million in the fourth quarter of  which is higher than the amount for the full year is complicated in view of the fact that we had nols coming into the quarter the fourth quarter provision includes a change in our estimated effective federal and state income tax rates for the calendar year of  the effect of which gets recorded in the fourth quarter plus there’s an adjustment a fairly sizeable adjustment for uncertain state tax positions in accordance with fas interpretation no  affectionately referred to as fin  and this is a noncash tax accrual the elements of the our annual provision for income taxes are more fully explained in footnote  as i indicated in our k that will be filed tomorrow we began the calendar year  with a carry forward of  million then in  our earnings were such that at the end of  there remained only approximately  million of federal net operating loss tax carry forwards into  we anticipate fully utilizing the remaining nol carry forwards in recognizing and paying federal income taxes at the regular rates in  we are in a very good liquidity position and based on what many of you see about the credit markets right now this is a good time to be very liquid which we are our total interest bearing debt at  was  million or an increase at  million compared to year  cash and cash equivalents at year end  was  million or an increase of  million compared to year end  the total long term debt at  includes mortgages and equipment loans of  million the   million convertible debentures that are due at  and thermaclime’s new  million secured term loan that’s due in  the  million term loan due in  was entered into in november  and replaced a previous loan of the same amount but under far better terms and conditions including less collateral and less interest and is priced at  day libor plus  basis points cash flow for the calendar  was positive by  million the positive cash flow included the net cash provided by operations of  million which included prepayments from ag customers of  million it further includes the net proceeds of  million for the  convertible debentures and it includes reductions in interest bearing debt of  million and capital expenditures of  million briefly summarizing our liquidity and capital resources at december st  as i indicated cash was  million there were no outstanding borrowings on the  million working capital revolver loan our total long term debt to ebitda for  was approximately  times or less than  to  if we assume the cash to be applied through a series of exchanges conversions and redemptions the series  class c public preferred stock and all of the accrued unpaid dividends have been eliminated there are currently  million shares outstanding and approximately  million additional common shares issueable upon the conversion or exercise of all other diluted securities options and warrants in fact there are no warrants outstanding stockholders’ equity has increased to  million from  million at prior year end as you can see during  we made major improvements in our balance sheet and capital structure continuing that improvement is a key management strategy jack i believe that concludes the summary financial overview of our results of operations and our financial position barry will now review the climate control business barry h golsen i’m pleased to report to everyone on this conference call that our climate control businesses’ overall  results improved dramatically over  i plan t elaborate on that later however for those of you who might be new to the call the lsb companies in our climate control business design manufacture and market a broad range of high quality air conditioning heating and heat pump products used in commercial industrial and residential climate control systems we’re the us market leader for geothermal heat pumps water source pumps and hydronic fan coils in addition we manufacture and market small air handlers large custom air handling units modular water chillers coaxial heat exchangers and turbine fan heat exchangers in addition we complete large scale geothermal installations throughout the united states our products are used in many different types of buildings for both new construction and renovation and replacement historically our business has not been dependent upon the health or weakness of any single construction sector moving onto fourth quarter climate control financial highlights as compared to the fourth quarter of  sales rose  to  million operating income was  million as compared to  million a  quarteroverquarter decline ebitda was  million compared to  million in  looking closely at quarteroverquarter results our gross profit increased by  of sales reflecting the impact of price increases implemented during the course of the year in response to material cost increases that we had incurred earlier those of you who were on our q  conference call will recall that we had in that period a nonrecurring gain of  million which was due to the award and receipt of legal fees relating to an arbitration case subtracting this gain from our segment operating income in  our periodoverperiod segment operating income actually improved by  in  this is a  increase on  greater sales for the quarter for the full year  sales rose  to  million operating income was  million compared to  million a  yearoveryear increase ebitda was  million a  increase over  million in  the improvement in profitability for the year was primarily the result of higher sales volumes principally in our heat pump and fan coil businesses the overall gross profit for  was  slightly lower than  in  this was primarily due to material price increases that we incurred early in the year while we raised our selling prices accordingly due to the large backlogs we had at the time it took several months to realize the full effect of those increases but you can see by the results in the fourth quarter that by the end of the year those selling price increases had taken effect during  we increased our industry leading market share in geothermal heat pumps water source heat pumps and fan coils at year end our us market share for heat pump products and fan coils was approximately  and  respectively this was up from  for heat pumps and  for fan coils in  we’re encouraged with this continued progress we’ve been the market leader in fan coils and total water source heat pumps – and by that i mean combined commercial and singlefamily residential – for some time as to singlefamily residential geothermal sales we believe that during  and  we took the lead in this market as well during the fourth quarter of  bookings of product orders were lower than expected  million compared to  million during the same period in  whereas we were disappointed with lower incoming orders during the fourth quarter i’m happy to report to you that so far in  the order level seems to have rebounded year to date through february th just the first two months our product orders have been  million compared to  million for the first two months of last year a  increase this is substantially higher than the rate of order intake during the fourth quarter of  as well during the first two months order intake almost equaled order intake for the full fourth quarter we closed the year with a backlog of  million as compared to  million at december st  our backlog of product orders as of  was up to  million in our business working down backlog while growing sales is a good thing we worked hard to reduce our factory lead times and they have improved substantially prior to  our climate control business had been slightly seasonal shipping more in the second and third quarters than the first and fourth quarters corresponding to the seasonality of the construction industry that we serve for the past two years our shipments did not follow this pattern due to the large backlogs we were carrying and extended factory lead times now that we have reduced our backlogs and lead times i would expect to see our historical shipping seasonality return following the significant capital expenditures we made in  and  to increase our manufacturing capacity we recently entered into a contract to acquire  acres of land to accommodate future expansion updating you on our core products sales of climate masters water source heat pumps and geothermal heat pumps continued to improve during  total heat pump sales in  were up  over  sales of our geothermal heat pump product line continued to increase as well during  our combined geothermal unit sales both singlefamily residential and commercial were up approximately  over  this contrast to the total geothermal industry shipments which increased  reflecting increased market share for our products during  our sales of hydronic fan coil products manufactured by international environmental were also up substantially approximately  over  this increase is primarily due to higher demand for our modular high rise fan coil products sold to the hospitality and multifamily construction markets turning now to the outlook for construction from our understanding of the most recent data available from mcgrawhill here is our current view as you know the vast majority of our climate control business sales are to commercial and institutional construction renovation and replacement in  commercial and institutional sales accounted for approximately  of our total climate control business sales about  of those sales or  of our total sales were to these building types offices hotels educational facilities health care and retirement facilities and manufacturing and process plants apartments and condominiums mcgrawhill’s current outlook as reported in the spring edition of their construction market forecasting service is that the commercial and institutional segments that account for  of our climate control business sales those building types that i just listed will decrease by approximately  in  and will increase in  through  by   and  a total of approximately  compounded for all practical purposes the updated numbers do not represent a meaningful change since the last conference call the commercial and institutional construction sectors which are important to lsb are forecast to decline slightly in  from recent record high levels and remain strong for the following three years turning now to singlefamily residential which accounted for approximately  of total climate control business sales in  we’re all aware of the sharp decline that has occurred in this market according to mcgrawhill there was a  decline in contract awards in this sector in  from  and a  further decline in   is forecast to decline another  followed by very robust increases of  in  and  in  focusing more specifically on the residential hvac industry heating and air conditioning totally unitary shipments of air conditioners and air source heat pumps as reported by the air conditioning and refrigeration institute were down  in  from  however our singlefamily residential sales has so bucked this trend during  our residential geothermal sales increased  over  in  our residential geothermal business was up approximately  higher than  whereas we have managed to outpace the conventional residential hvac market for the past eight quarters the depths of the current market slump has definitely impacted our rate of growth we believe the market drivers for residential geothermal are somewhat different than the market at large high energy prices environmental concerns and energy security concerns drive the demand for these geothermal systems which are a green form of renewable energy that reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions overall the size of the residential market approximately  million units per year in  represents huge upside potential for our geothermal products i would like to emphasize again and it’s important to focus on this fact with lsb’s overall exposure to a downturn in the singlefamily residential market is not great in  only  of lsb’s total sales were to this market following up on discussions in earlier conference calls regarding legislation that could possibly be beneficial to our geothermal business during  the energy independence and security act was enacted we reviewed this in the last conference call although this bill did not have direct tax incentives for geothermal it did have several favorable provisions during february  the us house of representatives passed the renewable energy and energy conservation tax act this bill allows a  tax credit for consumers who install geothermal systems it must now go to the us senate for approval and has bipartisan support i sent emails to many of you asking you to support this legislation by sending letters to your senators and contacting them personally if you can we appreciate the support that we have received so far from many of you and if you haven’t sent letters yet i’d like to encourage you to take a few minutes to do so senators actually keep track of these letters and they’re extremely effective if you haven’t heard from us on this and would like suggested language for letters please contact us at – and her is our email address – infolsbokccom let me repeat that infolsbokccom and we’ll be able to send you some suggested language for letters to send out to your senators summing up  was a record year for our climate control business we continued the trend of improved top and bottom line results the investments that we’ve made in product innovation sales and marketing and on the production side of our business have achieved and should continue to achieve the desired long term results we plan to push forward and not to alter our long term strategies in reaction to short term market conditions we believe we’re on the right track toward the continued long term growth of this business segment while we’ve recently been challenged by lower bookings in the fourth quarter of  i’m very excited about the prospects for growing all of lsb’s climate control businesses and particularly our geothermal heat pumps we believe this is the right product for our times and an important part of the solution to the nation’s energy and environmental concerns thanks for your attention i’ll now turn the meeting over to tony to discuss the details of the chemical business tony m shelby before we get into details in summary our chemical business sales for  increased  and our operating income increased from  million in  to  million in  for the calendar year we produce and market anhydrous ammonia nitric and sulfuric acids industrial grade ammonium nitrate and nitrogen based fertilizers including ammonium nitrate and urea ammonium nitrate nyseuan these products are for the industrial mining and agricultural markets approximately  of our  sales were to industrial and mining customers pursuant to proxy arrangements that generally include the market cost of raw materials the balance or approximately  of our sales were to the agricultural sector at spot market prices in effect at time of sale our agricultural business while seasonal and cyclical has seen a strong upturn this year as a result of increased crop production requiring nitrogen fertilizers we are operating three production facilities in el dorado arkansas cherokee alabama and in baytown texas the baytown texas facility is a single trained world skilled nitric acid plants arkansas and alabama are multiplant sites with multiple plants at those locations to review the fourth quarter results overall our chemical business performed extremely well sales were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  a  increase operating income was  million compared to  in the  fourth quarter ebitda was  million an increase of  million compared to last year as indicated in our press release the operating income and ebitda increases of  and  million respectively include an insurance recovery of  million excluding the insurance recovery the profit margins were substantially higher in  than in  further to my opening comments our results for the calendar year  included net sales of  million versus  million a  million increase or  operating income as  million versus approximately  million last year a  million increase or a  increase ebitda was  million compared to  million last year a  million increase as further indicated in our press release the operating income for the full year of  included an insurance recovery of  million and a  million recovery due to a favorable litigation settlement both of those associated with the cherokee alabama facility excluding these recoveries and settlements the profit margins were substantially higher in  than in  this improved performance in quarterly and annual results were driven by substantially higher sales prices for our fertilizer products and somewhat better pricing for our mining products and industrial assets gross profit margins and operating income are also significantly higher these increases were primarily attributable to higher selling prices associated with agricultural sales and continued improved plant production performance this has been highly publicized global grain stock including corn and wheat are at low levels and are driving the demand for nitrogen fertilizers these favorable supply and demand fundamentals were the catalyst for significantly higher selling prices and better margins in  on a product by product basis in the fertilizer area selling prices for fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in our market areas were approximately  higher in the fourth quarter  than the same period in  raw material feed stocks of anhydrous ammonia was also relatively stable during the fourth quarter of  the anhydrous ammonia published price at tampa averaged approximately  per metric ton in the fourth quarter compared to approximately  in the fourth quarter of  however anhydrous ammonia prices as posted in tampa have escalated significantly since the beginning of the year increasing from an average of the mid s per metric ton in january to an average of roughly mid s in february and a current price of  per metric ton this current high cost of imported ammonia increases the cost of nitrogen products produced in our el dorado arkansas plant however the majority of these sales are to customers except the cost of ammonia as a pass through published selling prices for ureaammonium nitrate fertilizer uan in our market areas were approximately  higher in the fourth quarter of  than in the fourth quarter of  the uan natural gas feed stock cost consumed by our cherokee alabama plant were relatively stable experiencing very little volatility throughout the  fourth quarter spot natural gas prices excluding transportation during the fourth quarter of  averaged about  compared to  in the fourth quarter last year currently the spot market natural gas prices is approximately  per mmbtu and the  month strip which changes daily is quoted a little bit lower than  in addition to the strong economics in the agricultural sector our  margins were also favorably affected by the steady demand for our acids for industrial applications and our industrial grade ammonium nitrate for surface mining consumption high demand across all product lines resulted in production efficiencies associated with improved plant run rates from a forwardlooking outlook we continue to be encouraged by the market demand for the agricultural products and performance for our production facilities market data indicates that continued strong demand for nitrogen fertilizer due to increased grain production spurred by lower grain inventories basically globally lowered grain inventory in general as well as increased demand for forage crops our chemical business will continue to focus on growing our nonseasonal industrial customer basis with an emphasis on customers’ accepted risk inherent with raw material costs while maintaining a strong presence in the seasonal agricultural sector we have the ability to reallocate portions of our capacity to nitrogen based fertilizers when the markets indicate favorable volumes and margins our strategy is to emphasize cost reduction and develop a product and customer mix that will allow us to operate our plants at full rates thereby lowering the fixed cost of each unit of production that concludes our prepared remarks and i will now turn the call over to jack to begin the qa segment of the call jack e golsen okay we’ve gone over fourth quarter and year results and we’re ready to answer any questions that you might have to the best of our ability keep in mind that we do not give guidance and we do not make forwardlooking statements questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from dan mannes with avondale please state your question daniel mannes – avondale partners llc couple questions actually starting out on the climate segment – tony m shelby could you speak up dan please jack e golsen dan we can’t hear you daniel mannes – avondale partners llc first of all in the climate segment first of all thanks for the overview obviously it was very detailed but i did have a follow up question on the commercial side given the presumed slowdown how much visibility do you have in terms of your ability to sell i mean given the fact that its your distributors bidding for projects how far can you look ahead or see ahead in that kind of market barry h golsen that’s a good question and it’s a very difficult question to answer because we can see out – it depends on the size of the project really because typically larger projects have much longer life cycles from the initial concept of the project to the ultimate installation which can be several years whereas other projects that are smaller and of a different nature can be much shorter so we’re always looking at a huge pipeline of potential projects out there i’ve never really tried to quantify it as to a specific timeframe but i’ll just give you an example when someone is planning  let’s just take a good example  a large hotel project in vegas  and we’ve done a lot of business and we’ve discussed that before  they could start talking about a project now and it could be four years before that finally ends up going and gets installed now a lot of things could happen if the economy holds up and the economy is very good that pipeline stays in tact and if things start to go south – i don’t want to be negative – but if things start to go south you could see that pipeline change where projects get pushed out and moved around right now we’re seeing a strong pipeline of business and we are not – and this is to a certain degree anecdotal from our sales force – but in addition to the mcgrawhill that i’ve outlined to you what we’re hearing is a strong pipeline of business from our sales force daniel mannes – avondale partners llc a second question on climate we’ve seen a tick up in copper prices this quarter it looks fairly significant so far can you talk at all about either hedging activity there or is that another scenario where you would look to maybe increase pricing later in the year to recover barry h golsen both we try to hedge commodities from time to time when we can and we have an ongoing active department that does that and we review that and we focus on that but we try to the extent that the market will allow us considering that it’s a competitive market and a large part of our business is subject to bids we try to pass those material costs through whether or not we’re hedging and it’s what the market will bear but we attack it from both ends daniel mannes – avondale partners llc and then last question on the climate segment and this is really both for residential and commercial are you seeing any change in behavior between sort of new build and retrofit i mean probably more visible on the residential side given the slowdown in new construction but are you feeling a change there or has that been fairly steady over time barry h golsen well i think if you look at the ratio – you’re asking the question about construction and i am going to answer it a little different than you asked it relating it specifically on residential first to  focusing on residential what you’re seeing is the ratio of replacement and retrofit go up dramatically in residential and the industry at large because new construction is down so much okay and so there’s a fairly rapid ratio and the way you look at that – and i can’t really give you the exact numbers because i haven’t calculated that – the way to calculate that ratio is to look at the air conditioning and refrigeration institute reports of total sales unitary sales which most of that is to singlefamily residential in that  million and then look at the reported new house construction and take those two as a ratio of each other so you see a fairly quick change there more toward renovation and replacement mostly replacement in that business than in commercial in commercial what we’ve seen historically is that when new construction gets softer and is down that replacement picks up and as a percentage of the total market it’s available to us that it picks up it’s a more gradual shift we haven’t seen a significant shift there yet daniel mannes – avondale partners llc actually i’m sorry last question on climate have you seen any pick up in activity in canada relative to the fairly strong subsidy programs there or is that – barry h golsen well it’s a really strong market for us and we’ve done well in the market and continue to do well in that market but we really haven’t seen a big impact from the subsidies and the reason for that is because of the bureaucratic delay in installing and implementing a way to administer the rebates that were enacted into law the legislature typically will say the end result that they want you know we’re going to give a rebate of x but then they throw it out to the various agencies who have to develop a way to administer it for people to apply and qualify etcetera and that takes some time when you’re dealing with governmental agencies so in fact it really kind of missed the season for this last year we expect to see some impact next year daniel mannes – avondale partners llc and if i have enough time i have a couple quick questions on chemicals just given the increase in gas prices and nat gas are you guys doing actively for hedging gas needs for cherokee jack e golsen yes we have built in hedges on our pass through business where it’s cost plus and then we do hedge usage we don’t go out and hedge speculatively beyond what we’re going to use in the period we do that on a monthly basis daniel mannes – avondale partners llc and then in terms of the pricing tony noted pricing for agricultural products in the fourth quarter was up i think  yearoveryear obviously your revenues – that’s only  of your revenue but it clearly wasn’t – it doesn’t look like you were as leveraged to that price increase as possible i’m wondering was there a lot of presold activity jack e golsen the  was only ureaammonium nitrate you got  on the ammonium nitrate two different products come out of two different plants daniel mannes – avondale partners llc and then last thing would be on prior you noted in your opening comments that you’re undertaking at least looking at the permitting activities can you give us a little more detail about what the opportunity is restarting this plant understanding it’s at a preliminary stage jack e golsen with the caveat that we haven’t made the final decision yet that will depend on several factors we do not intend at this time if we do start it up to start up the complete plant we’re only starting up about four or five of the units because that’s a big facility if we do start it up our preliminary plan is to produce about  tons of uan plus some ammonia and potentially some industrial products – what was the question daniel mannes – avondale partners llc just trying to understand what the opportunity is and i think – jack e golsen the opportunity is to enhance our chemical business a substantial number just ballparking if we use today’s prices our start up would be in the  million range daniel mannes – avondale partners llc of revenue jack e golsen of revenue yes daniel mannes – avondale partners llc and given the time you mentioned  to  months is that including permitting and would there be any benefit during the start up or would that be sort of like a cliff it all – jack e golsen what there would be the permitting has already been started as far as applications etcetera the permitting will come before the start up substantially before the start up the start up will be in phases  and i’m talking about a complete start up of everything that we intend to start – there will be some units like the ammonia plant which would start up it won’t take that long however there’s the urea plant and the uan facility which would take longer so before we would really benefit from the entire operation of that plant we’re saying  to  months tony m shelby and one point the fact that permitting has begun should not be a signal that we’ve made a decision jack made very clear the whole thing is if we decide to go forward jack e golsen here’s what we’re going to look at you know this is a changing market and we want to be sure to the extent that we can be sure we can never be positive that the business plan makes sense and the costs to start up the plant are in line with our expectations and that the payback is there without a long term risk all these things are being worked on now we have engineers working on it we’ve got our financial people working on it we’ve got our environmental people working on it and we expect to make a decision in the not too distant future operator operator instructions our next question comes from the cliff warren with cibc cliff warren – cibc couple of questions in  what’s your cap ex on the chemical plants and geothermal any plans there barry h golsen what’s our what jack e golsen cap ex cliff warren – cibc yep jack e golsen we haven’t disclosed that we have commitments i think of about  million in chemical and we have commitments as barry indicated we’re buying some land we have commitments of about  million in climate control which we have disclosed or will disclose in the k tomorrow but beyond that cliff we haven’t made any – tony m shelby and that does not include the pryor plant jack e golsen that does not include pryor cliff warren – cibc in terms of the chemical climate is there any major turnarounds needed in  tony m shelby yes there are major turnarounds every year as we disclosed in previous conference calls we spent about  million in the fourth quarter of  which was not significantly higher than we did in  so we had turnarounds in almost every quarter because try to stagger those that we don’t – for instance the el dorado arkansas doesn’t turn around all their plants at the same time but  million in the fourth quarter of  obviously is a big turnaround quarter versus smaller turnaround quarters cliff warren – cibc so there’s no big turnaround quarters coming up in this year that you know of yet tony m shelby just the normal pattern cliff warren – cibc in terms of pryor what would be the cost of starting up that plant approximately in your guestimation jack e golsen we don’t know yet we’re trying to get bids on it all we’re talking somewhere between  and  million tony m shelby  to  million for a  million in revenue approximately guessing cliff warren – cibc just one other question in terms of natural gas when you say hedging basically natural gas let’s say today is at  and you’re doing production next month let’s say in april so you’re buying gas now for april production is that correct and not really going any farther than that jack e golsen no we’re buying gas now for march cliff warren – cibc so you’re buying in the spa market for spa production on the ag side jack e golsen no the reason we’re doing that is we think that this jump is temporary it does it every year during this period and we expect to see it settle out at a lower number but we’re not sure of that we don’t have a crystal ball but that’s our best knowledge best thinking that we have barry h golsen i want to add something here just to remind the other listeners who aren’t as familiar as you are cliff because i know you know this and that is that only one of our plants uses natural gas as a primary feed stock that would be cherokee and el dorado and baytown use ammonia operator our next question comes from a private investor by the name of revis lewis jack e golsen who barry h golsen would you repeat the name please operator revis lewis jack e golsen revis lewis revis lewis – private investor do you have any legal problems that you haven’t mentioned and if the inaudible was an oxymoron what would be a fair price for the seller barry h golsen i can’t hear you jack e golsen i’m really sorry but we can’t – tony m shelby do we have any legal problems that we haven’t talked about and what do we think a fair price for the stock is is that right revis lewis – private investor thank you barry h golsen all of our legal issues that we think are material are disclosed in the k jack e golsen yeah you’ll have that tomorrow barry h golsen and you’ll have that tomorrow jack e golsen they haven’t changed materially from the third quarter revis lewis – private investor what do you think a fair price of the stock would be barry h golsen the value of the stock we have to leave that up to the market but of course we think our stock is significantly undervalued revis lewis – private investor i agree barry h golsen especially the last couple days jack e golsen any other questions operator there are no further questions i will now turn the conference back to management jack e golsen thanks everybody operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our conference for today
