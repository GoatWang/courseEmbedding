a recent viral facebook post isnt the first to cause concern about the product  claim banana boat brand sunscreen is causing severe burns particularly on toddlers and young children unproven rating unproven origin in may  rebecca cannon a canadian woman published a series of posts on facebook describing the seconddegree chemical burns her monthold daughter kyla purportedly suffered after cannon sprayed her with banana boat kids spf sunscreen  photos accompanying the posts appear to show significant burns blisters and swelling on her daughter’s face cannon who lives in the newfoundland and labrador province recounted the experience in an interview with cbc on  may  as the day went on she got a little redder and redder and the next morning she woke up and was swollen she was bright red there were blisters starting to pop up we immediately took her up to the doctors and found out she has second degree burns in a facebook post two days later cannon said …it has been verified and confirmed  times now a nd degree caustic burn chemical burn the episode resembles another from  which also attracted some media attention in may  virginia resident jennifer bradford sayers posted an account of her sons’ experience after purportedly using the banana boat kids spf aerosol spray  our family spent a fantastic day at the local beach saturday we were there for aproximately  hours sic we used banana boat kids spf  spray sunscreen thirty minutes prior to hitting the beach to allow it to soak in as recommended and reapplied at intervals while at the beach towel drying prior and allowing for time for the product to soak in again as recommended by the manufactors sic both boys wore rash guards for about half of the day we left the beach sporting slight sunburns but nothing could prepare us for how liam looked only  hours later liam has st nd and possible rd degree burns on his nose and cheeks sic caleb has blistering on his shoulders but no where near as bad as liam has on his face the post was accompanied by several photos appearing to show significant burns blisters and swelling to liam’s face  we have no reason to doubt the veracity of either rebecca cannon and jennifer bradford sayers’s accounts there are no obvious implausibilities logical gaps or incidental inaccuracies that would indicate their stories might be exaggerated or untruthful  that said however we obviously cannot verify the sequence of events described in both accounts nor confirm that what is shown in the photos is in fact the result of what both women claim — that is the application of banana boat kids spf  banana boat kids spf is approved by the skin cancer foundation however the fda advises that “spray sunscreens should never be applied directly to your face” the fda also says that certain chemicals in sunscreens can provoke an allergic reaction when exposed to sunlight on a person’s skin and that this can result in “sunburnlike symptoms a rash or other unwanted side effects” however an fda spokesperson told us this is rare the fda is aware of rare cases of serious allergic reactions that have been reported with the use of sunscreen products  overthecounter sunscreen products include a warning to watch for skin rashes as a possible adverse event related to the use of the product although consumers occasionally experience a skin reaction the overall benefits of sunscreen use far outweigh the risks of these reactions we got an expert assessment from dr joyce teng clinical professor of dermatology and pediatrics at stanford university school of medicine who reviewed the photos posted to facebook by both rebecca cannon and jennifer bradford sayers the photos shown for both cases suggest that the children had allergic contact dermatitis that is exacerbated by photo exposure exposure to sunlight dr teng said both sets of photos appeared to show “severe” examples of “allergic contact reaction” to the sunscreen and added as a pediatric dermatologist i do not recommend the use of aerosol sunscreen on children as it is very difficult to control the quantity and quality of the sunscreen application  banana boat kids spf was one of a range of banana boat ultra mist products withdrawn from the market in  “due to a potential risk of product igniting on the skin if contact is made with a source of ignition before the product is completely dry” in a statement edgewell personal care the company that manufactures banana boat products told us this was done “out of an abundance of caution after an issue with the delivery system of the affected products specifically the size of the spray valve opening was reported” they added “currently marketed banana boat products have a different valve and remain safe to use as directed”  in relation to concerns that the children’s sunscreen spray may be causing burns the company said we take all of our consumer’s concerns seriously and investigate all cases when we are contacted directly about someone who has encountered a reaction when using our products however it is difficult to determine what may have caused reported problems as described without examining the product or determining the specific type of reaction with that said our quality assurance team will look into reported cases and assist consumers reporting concerns in any way we can as part of this commitment we have engaged with the families associated with the cases you mention importantly all banana boat products including banana boat spf kid’s spray undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are appropriately labeled and meet all relevant health regulations including spf tests all banana boat sunscreens fall within a neutral ph range which means they are safe for human skin topical use and cannot cause chemical burns which are sometimes mistakenly linked to personal care products or confused with sunburns or tissue damage we encourage people who have concerns about a type of burn to visit a dermatologist who can determine the differences between a chemical burn a sun burn or a reaction to sunscreen itself got a tip or a rumor contact us here ask chat pokesnopes facebook group

the more overlooked success stories of the global chemical industry privately held by dow chemical and corning dow corning is the world’s top silicones producer and through its majority stake in hemlock semiconductor group the leading maker of polycrystalline silicon polysilicon the raw material for computer chips and solar cells dow corning has historically seen steady growth but in the past six years its performance has accelerated dramatically and innovation has played a key role in this dow corning has always grown by combining a capability in lowcost bulk silicones with leadership in siliconbased specialty chemicals it continues to follow this approach with a new largescale plant in zhangjiagang china a joint venture with wacker chemie which will complement its largescale plants in the united states and the united kingdom similarly in polysilicon hemlock semiconductor is building a new plant in clarksville tennessee to maintain its capacity and cost lead what is new is the acceleration of the company’s sales and earnings trajectory part of this is being driven by strong growth in demand in developing markets such as china dow corning’s lowcost manufacturing base puts it in a strong position to serve this demand but the company is not simply sitting back while it rides that wave instead it has made a significant push in innovation to strengthen its growth momentum it has drastically redesigned and reenergized its newproductdevelopment approach and at the same time has emerged as a chemicalindustry leader in businessmodel innovation in  in the fading days of the dotcom boom dow corning took a bold gamble when it launched xiameter a new business model comprising an onlinemanaged lowcost nofrills sales channel for its commodity silicones offering competitive pricing to customers willing to buy in bulk without research or technical support plenty of other chemical companies were dabbling in ecommerce but none embraced a business model that effectively divided the company’s products into two brands as in this case where there was the traditional dow corning on the one hand offering customers specialty silicones backed up by technical support and rd and xiameter on the other dow corning confirmed the success of the new business model in  when it announced a fivefold increase in the number of products it offers via xiameter meanwhile sales growth based on newproduct innovation has continued to accelerate sidebar stephanie burns biography vital statistics born married with  child education graduated with a phd in organic chemistry with a

councilrecipient of the american chemical society’s earle b barnes award in  stephanie burns a phd chemist has been dow corning’s ceo since  and has led these developments she and gregg zank the company’s chief technology officer and senior vice president sat down recently at their midland michigan headquarters with mckinsey’s bob frei and chris musso to discuss their perspectives on successful innovation in the chemical industry mckinsey where does innovation stand among your priorities stephanie burns innovation is definitely one of the very top priorities for the company it’s our future—it’s the way we’re going to grow we divide the very substantial growth we have achieved over the past nine years into three categories and there’s been a major innovation component to all of them the first is momentum growth which is directly linked to gdp expansion around the world and xiameter has brought us a lot of growth there the second is penetrating new geographies with our technology and innovation plays an important role here because we’ll often do formulations that are specific for the geography or employ innovative business models that allow us to expand in a particular region the third category is more traditional “pure” innovation—new applications and products all three categories have contributed to growth with the biggest shares driven by the second and third categories mckinsey how has your approach to innovation changed in the past decadestephanie burns ten years ago our innovation approach was mostly the traditional insideout materialsinnovation approach but we decided that this approach was not working well—we really needed to deliver greater returns from our strategic rd investments reevaluating our approach to innovation has been part of a complete rethink of dow corning’s business dow corning has always enjoyed respectable growth rates across most of its businesses and for better or worse this led to an attitude in the company that every business is a growth business and an attitude to rd spending where everyone gets the same level of investment and people across the company felt almost entitled to a certain level of investment but in the early s we could see that parts of our portfolio were maturing and becoming less differentiated and the serviceintensive specialtychemical approach to doing business was no longer wanted by parts of our customer base those customers were mainly interested in the most competitive prices for undifferentiated products backed by reliable supply seeing this and recognizing that there was going to be more of this trend coming was a major driver for us in our design of the xiameter business model we couldn’t treat those more pricesensitive and innovationinsensitive customers the same as our specialty customers and so we separated our product offering into two brands the xiameter brand and the dow corning brandgregg zank and at the same time we recognized that we needed to rethink our approach to newproduct innovation across all our businesses to get better returns we saw that we couldn’t invest in every market the same but we needed to be selective and choose those innovation areas where we’re going to get the biggest returns and have the biggest impact on the company mckinsey how did you deal with the challenges and cultural issues within the company when making this change stephanie burns i think we have been successful in this because we defined a really clear business model—xiameter—for our undifferentiated business we have been very clear on what that brand represents and what its goals are for cash generation and contribution to the earnings of the company that business model is all about efficiency and quality of supply to our customers at a price point that allows them to really be competitive customers are not asking for a lot of product innovation in that space so that would be an area where we are not going to put research dollars except toward process improvements at the same time we have been very clear on the differentiated side of the company about which areas we wish to invest in and what our customer acceptance and financial expectations are and we have shifted resources to priority areas we had to communicate clearly that it’s just as important to work in area a as area b and that both are critical to serve our customers we’re going to create growth in each unit but they have different mandates and deliverables it has taken time to get the teams comfortable with this but now people see the success and so they are buying into it with great commitment i think that one advantage we have culturally is that we have employees who are extremely creative and willing to try new things and who do not resist change the way that perhaps they do in some other companies we’ve worked hard on encouraging the dynamic that it’s healthy to embrace change it comes down to leadership and clarity of purpose this certainly has required changes in behavior take the salespeople in our specialtychemical business their job out in the field is to do newbusiness development and work with customers on new areas of growth—it’s not to go in and sell existing products to existing customers with the same application that they’ve sold for the past five years so they’ve had a real change in their mandate with our relaunch of xiameter in  not only did we put more products into xiameter but we also continued to finetune these two business models—xiameter and specialtyoriented dow corning—and add more clarity we still had some undifferentiated products managed by our specialty business and by moving them to xiameter we have been able to serve our customers with more clarity we will do that kind of finetuning constantly in the future a product may currently be managed by our lifesciences business or industrialintermediates business but as the products mature we’re going to challenge the business every year should that be a dow corning–branded product or should it be managed by xiameter and we’ll move products over as appropriate meanwhile we are getting new specialty products from our innovation efforts to expand our dow corning portfolio that more than offset what is moved to xiametermckinsey how do you know when a product should move to xiameter and what are the challenges and opportunitiesgregg zank it’s not by our definition that a product is no longer differentiated—it’s our customers’ and the marketplace’s that in turn reinforces the message within the company that we have to embrace this new business model there are clear signals when a product is in the undifferentiated area for instance do we have intellectual property protecting our product or are there a lot of similar products on offer from the competition and when we go to visit the customer are we meeting with the newbusiness developer or only with the procurement team that’s a pretty strong signal right there stephanie burns but it’s important to recognize that there is a huge opportunity in the xiameter model not only in providing customers with reliable supply at a certain price point but also for the company overall as the lowcost highly efficient supplier we are winning at that lowcost game and we’re going to continue to win we’ve got fully utilized assets and efficiencies in our manufacturing operations that we believe are the most competitive in the industry the offtake of the large lowcost plants also goes into our specialty business where we develop finished formulated products and we get a lot more value than just selling the basic intermediates so the innovation that goes on in our specialty plants that leverages this lowcost position is a wonderful synergy and at the same time there are a lot of innovation challenges posed by the xiameter side of the business for instance how do we get a product line’s cost down to stay competitive and make the right level of return there’s a lot of energy and excitement going into improving manufacturing and process efficiency as well as on the business and commercial side it can be just as exciting as newproduct innovationmckinsey what are your thoughts on newproduct versus businessmodel innovation gregg zank it’s not blackandwhite the days are gone when you could just make a new product and customers would beat a path to your door to be successful in the marketplace and establish a sustainable competitive advantage requires a combination of approaches the key for us is customer intimacy which guides us as to which levers of innovation we should employ—how much new product and new technology how much new solutions and how much businessmodel innovation it’s also important to consider regional differences mature products in one region may be innovative products in another at the same time there may be a need to explore a new business model packaging or delivery method for example to successfully deploy a product line in a certain region stephanie burns in businessmodel innovation our big “aha” came with xiameter that really opened the door for us to think differently and we’ve realized that new business models are just as critical for newproduct development as they are in the more mature parts of our business we deployed new ways of working with our partners for instance faster prototyping or finding different ways to more quickly establish profitability and in our polysilicon business we have implemented new business models designed to ensure that we meet our needs and our customers’ needsmckinsey how do you steer your newproduct innovation approach gregg zank we want to focus on areas that are driven by large societal trends and needs in the world—megatrends—because we know those trends are going to drive discontinuities in the marketplace there are a number of areas we are particularly interested in these include health care and personal care renewable energy construction and electronics—where we are looking at the everexpanding demand for devices and the merger of electronics with other areas such as photonics and biotechnology and we are watching how megatrends—such as energy scarcity urbanization and others—interact with these when you’re tied into those discontinuities it just means the market opportunity is big you’re not in there fighting tooth and nail using price and other levers for a piece of a limitedsize market—instead you’re in a market that is expanding rapidly lightemitting diodes leds are a great example—they’re now showing up in flashlights displays traffic lights and in automobile exteriors and interiors and they have the potential to keep growing into areas of commercial and residential construction encapsulants for leds have been a great success story for us we started the work in the late s and it became a newbusiness program in the early s that was sheltered even though it was not making any money we backed it because we knew it was going to be a hit we had key intellectual property it’s a very enabling technology and we were ready to go when the market was ready our encapsulant business has grown dramatically over the past five years we are on the lookout for developments that are truly going to be disruptive and try to tie ourselves to them we constantly challenge ourselves and refresh that list of the large trends that we should be looking at and then we ask how can siliconbased materials provide a solution stephanie burns what we’ve been doing over the past four years is to take these megatrends and apply filters that narrow them down to what really could be the opportunity and identify how best our technology and competencies match that we’re not just saying there’s a wonderful megatrend out there in the demographic of an aging population and we’re going to invest all our projects against it but instead we’re defining where the opportunities are for dow corning we’ve been improving that process and have started to integrate it across the companymckinsey how does the process workgregg zank our underlying challenge was to improve the way we develop a raw idea into something tangible the approach we now use is to work very intensively for a highly compressed period of time— to  weeks we will take something as large as the societal impact of an aging population and distill that down with numerous interviews outside the company we dedicate a group of employees around the world to undertake a lot of strategic marketing—both technical people who are in my opinion very good earlystage strategic marketers because they ask a lot of difficult questions and commercial folks then we have weekly meetings to say what have we learned about this area it’s got to be a large opportunity it’s got to get marketplace acceptance within a certain time frame and it’s got to be something that is not incremental to what we are already doing we assess the applicability of our scientific tool kit against the opportunity and create an early proposal we pressuretest the proposals from the points of view of technology the market the supply chain and whether it will still be a good opportunity if some other external factors change it is a difficult thing for the team to go through because they want to chase five things and they only have time to get two worked up as full business proposals but i’m insistent that as we go through this we capture and document all the things that we leave on the side as well because they may be relevant for some of our other existing businesses in addition the process can help us identify markets that are starting to move and make us check if we are in tune with them are they on our radar screen and how are we interacting in the value chain of those markets we undertake this process twice a year in addition to identifying opportunities it completely energizes the entire company because there is not only a core team but also a broader team that gets involved because there are web calls for information where people can contribute so everybody is a part of it we end up with a pretty robust portfolio of initiatives as the process cycle proceeds mckinsey have any cultural issues emerged with the adoption of the megatrends approach gregg zank the danger we have run into is not so much resistance as that everyone reframes what was already going on to be part of a megatrend and everything becomes a greenenergy project or an agingpopulation project that’s why we have these filters and say ok within the aging population what are the big things that we think we can have an impact on and that have enough discontinuities and opportunities associated with them to represent a large area of growth for a significant amount of timestephanie burns we also have to take some care managing the filtering part of the process—this is the painful part where you have to let go of ideas early on that you don’t think are a hit and stay focused on the ones that look promising when we started this process our people got so enthused by innovation and sustainability and improving our planet and they were buying in fast and looking at things that we knew were not going to fly but you’ve got to let them expand the lists of ideas so that they say this is new and exciting and to make sure they’re going along the path with you you can’t shut it off prematurely you have to let it run its course mckinsey what are examples of megatrendlinked workgregg zank one of the problems with the aging population is diseases that make bones brittle so you can look at ways to protect the human body from falls or ways to better enhance bone growth in aging people since there is research relating bone strength to silica intake we said is there a way to help uptake of silicic acid or silica into the body to help bones be less brittle another is enhancing aging bodies’ efficiency in absorbing medicinal drugs and so is there some way to use silicones to help the uptake of drugs stephanie burns we also see megatrends intersect for example one of the trends with an aging population is that baby boomers want to live in their own homes rather than in a nursing home to take care of them and make sure they’re safe third parties observe them in their homes and so there are new electronics applications as you get to surveillance cameras and sensors in other words the electronics megatrend intersects with the agingpopulation megatrendmckinsey dow corning seems to have shifted its rd talent strategy to include more than just silicone chemists hiring physicists materials scientists and even industrial designers how has this new combination changed the innovation problemsolving dynamic gregg zank it’s a great new dynamic when you combine a silicone chemist with a material scientist a ceramist and a metallurgist you get some very robust technology debates and you get to a good answer—not yet necessarily the right answer—but one you have a lot more confidence in because you did not just charge down one path stephanie burns here’s an example we know a lot of our customers buy our materials for the aesthetic properties—the feel or “hand” as it’s called the silky touch the visual appearance but we realized that there’s a whole element in how customers make buying decisions that we did not fully understand when silicone ends up in a piece of furniture or cookware we don’t know who these people are who are selecting the product when a maker of handheld electronic devices looks at silicones they are looking for the customer experience as well as the electroniccircuitry performance which we always focused on so we brought in an industrialdesign engineer who thinks completely differently from a chemist or physicist and this brings a totally different dynamic to the team’s interactions mckinsey is being just in silicon chemistry a limitationstephanie burns i’d argue our chemistry set is probably more complex than most companies’ and our expertise in that chemistry set allows us to do so many more things i am constantly amazed at the potential of silicon technology to meet the needs of current and future advanced applications i think we are able to build closer and stronger relationships with customers because our siliconbased expertise can be so enabling for them take skincare product makers they use thousands of different ingredients to make formulations but the silicone ingredient enables that formulation to perform and that gives us privileged access to their research department and we’ve deliberately built up a capability we call “application expertise” where we have scientists who are worldrenowned experts in many of our customers’ applications in hair care for example we have globally respected experts on how to test products on hair and our personalcare customers recognize and respect these experts’ workmckinsey how much time do you as ceo spend on innovation stephanie burns as ceo i would say around  percent on a pure innovation basis but innovation is part of everything we do so it is difficult to estimate i do have a very full understanding of the innovation portfolio which is on all our major executivemeeting agendas mckinsey what does it mean to have a scientist as ceostephanie burns when i am out with rd folks and teams that are bringing projects forward there’s probably an ease of discussion and a connectivity that takes place the last time i was with our compound semiconductor research team for instance i understood exactly what they were doing and the progress they have made in advancing silicon carbide waferproduction technology most important i think i probably have compared with a nonscientist a better understanding that this innovation stuff takes time to come to fruition and that you’ve got to keep these investments consistent and you cannot flipflop some of our big successes today had their genesis back in the late s in tough economic times you’re looking to squeeze anything you can and innovation is not immune to that but there’s a level of research expenditure that must be maintained—it’s not discretionary expenditure it’s required article actions share this article on linkedin share this article on twitter share this article
