received  january  accepted  february  httpwwwashdincomjournalsjfrearaspx abstract thermal degradation of waste plastics is one method currently being investigated as an alternative to landfill disposal of this increasingly large waste stream although the thermal process produces significant quantities of light naphtha range c–c liquids there is also a residual fraction that may be considered as a potential feedstock for upgrading in this study the fraction of a liquid produced by the thermal degradation process of waste plastics containing about  °c naphtha chemical was subjected to thermal reactions the reactions used a commercial hzsm supported on zeolite catalyst and gave good conversion to naphtha the process well simulated the experimental data including

practices to redefine the recycling landscape and how we recycle tomorrow and into the futureour po technology has successfully overcome significant barriers in the fuel industry some of the key differentiators of our process are outlined belowvalidation  permittingreputable independent labs have validated the po technology including islechem process engineering and conestogarovers  associates emissions stack test plasticoil® has been issued all necessary permits to operate by the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec plasticoil® has been issued an exemption from air permitting in the state where the first site will be located for the agreement with rocktenn company rocktenn engineering report performed by saic validates and verifies the technology and economics processorthe processor requires only  sq ft of operating space height requirement is approximately  ft highly automated very low operator to processor ratio modular design allows for easy deployment inputsthe po processor accepts unwashed unsorted waste plastics optimal feedstock includes polyethylene and polypropylene the po process is permitted by the nysdec for up to  lbs of plastic feedstock per machine per hour at the companys niagara falls ny facility processthe conversion ratio for waste plastic into fuel averages  approximately  gallon of fuel is extracted from  lbs of plastic the processor uses its own offgases as fuel approximately  of process output minimal energy is required to run the machine approximately  of the resulting product is petcoke carbon black a high btu fuel emissions are lower than a natural gas furnace of similar size and the quality of the emissions improve with increased feed rates results from the final stack test performed by conestogarivers  associates confirm that the processor emissions are well within the limits allowable under a nysdec air permit the process operates at atmospheric pressure and is not susceptible to pinhole leaks andor other problems with pressure and vacuumbased system the reusable catalyst is produced economically the fuel produced is refined and separated without the high cost of a distillation tower resource usagethe po processor is designed to use minimal amounts of external energy as well as being beneficial for the environment this is also a significant factor in the commercial viability of the process water is used for cooling only and usage is minimized through recycling the water in a noncontact closed loop the water is not in contact with the process itself keeping it clean and uncontaminated only  kwh electricity is required to run the fans pumps and small motors no electricity is used in the transformation of the plastic to fuel natural gas is only used on startup to heat the reactor – once the processor is running the reactor is heated with its own offgases a facilitywide gas compression system governs natural gas usage throughout the entire production process fuel outputfuel quality has been validated by multiple independent petrochemical labs including intertek petrolabs alberta resource council and southwest research institute all shipments leaving the po plant in niagara falls are tested by the companys fully equipped internal fuel testing lab fuel is ready for sale upon completion of processing without the need for further refinement from a single processor the company can produce a range of fuel products without further refining including no  fuel diesel petroleum distillate no  fuel naphtha petcoke carbon black and

viability of diesel production with po more global vision  local impact in the mids when the founder of plasticoil® was working at the ontario legislature he began to notice a trend an increase in plastic waste resulting from growing plastic generation  without recycling thinking forward as he so often does he saw the seed of an enormous problem looming in the ensuing  years the problem he foresaw has manifested because of the new disposable mentality that came with plastic containers we now are navigating the fallout of an enormous waste plastic problem on a global scale its complex its farreaching and its intimately tied to politics and economicsthe nugget of the problem that he had been thinking about all these years was what to do with the plastic waste we now generate – in the us alone over  million tons a year are generated with only approximately  being recycled over the years there have been various solutions proposed – diversion burning etc however nothing to date has proven to be a truly effective or environmentally responsible solution to the burgeoning global landfill problem in fact many existing solutions have been just the opposite costly energy inefficient or equally as harmful to the environment as the plastic itself its only now with the plasticoil technology that there is a solution that is not only economically viable but that is
