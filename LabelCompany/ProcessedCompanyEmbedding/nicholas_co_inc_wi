management since its founding by albert “ab” o nicholas in  our philosophy is based on a fundamental bottomup approach to security selection with a longterm investment horizon  our process focuses on identifying securities offering secular growth characteristics strong financial bases reasonable valuations and downside risk our longterm approach deemphasizes the shortterm impact of daytoday market volatility and maintains a focus on the longterm potential of the securities in our portfolios providing a more consistent return with reduced volatility encourages investors to maintain market exposure and stay invested for the long run the nicholas investment style tends to appeal to investors willing to forego some upside in market cycles for a more consistent return with the potential

access nicholas  nicholas funds  nicholas fund inc nicholas fund inc nicsx multicap growth nicholas fund inc is our flagship fund with its long history beginning in  the lead portfolio manager is david o nicholas cfa with michael l shelton serving as coportfolio manager nicholas fund was launched two years after albert “ab” o nicholas started nicholas company inc nicholas fund utilizes a multicap growth strategy that allows the portfolio manager to pursue the best growth opportunities in the market without being constrained by arbitrary market capitalization guidelines nicholas fund is generally focused on mid and larger capitalized stocks but will invest in smaller companies where the investment team finds opportunity while the entire market spectrum is a target universe for this strategy nicholas company has long had a primary focus on stocks with mid and small capitalizations early on we recognized the potential for these smaller sized companies to offer greater growth potential than larger cap stocks and greater opportunity to identify companies that wall street may have overlooked the fund will invest in larger cap stocks that we believe may have fallen out of favor with wall street offer significant valuation or growth opportunities and may lend stability to the portfolio with their consistent growth nicholas fund offers a mix of companies with varying capitalizations and the mix can change as stock valuations change a critical component to the fund’s style is buying stocks at valuations that offer the best opportunity over the longrun and that we believe may provide a margin of safety against declining stock prices nicholas has long been a proponent for buying stocks at valuations that are affordable relative to their longterm potential and owning them for the longterm… years not days or months we believe the fund’s history suggests this approach can produce more consistent riskadjusted returns over time snapshot objective performance

investment objective nicholas fund inc strives to increase the value of your investment over the longterm “longterm growth” by investing in a diversified portfolio that includes primarily medium and largesized companies small companies also may be considered our goal is to find what we believe are great companies and hold them for the longterm investment policies  considerations nicholas fund’s management team believes that company selection is a key to providing superior returns over time our goal is to find growth companies that are reasonably priced by identifying stocks that have low pricetoearnings ratios relative to their earnings growth or those that are attractively priced relative to book value above average earnings growth and strong future growth potential are important characteristics in the companies we consider when selecting portfolio holdings from among the stocks that meet our criteria we often take a contrary view and choose lesser known or outoffavor companies as they generally offer the best values some of the factors we consider in assessing companies include growth rate of  or better consistent earnings return on equity roe of  or an improving roe debt to total capitalization of less than  a price to earnings ratio lower than two times the growth rate an enduring franchise or brand honest capable management significant management ownership of stock longterm and shortterm business momentum it is our strong conviction that superior longterm results are achieved by minimizing capital losses in adverse markets we do not attempt to forecast shortterm market swings but work to preserve gains and minimize losses using longterm fundamental valuation techniques our portfolio turnover is moderate as our goal is to find and hold great companies however if a company’s stock is not meeting our expectations or has become over valued we will sell it at nicholas our watchword is patience we believe it is a key to superior longterm

an independently owned investment firm that has operated under the same investment philosophy process and management since its founding by albert “ab” o nicholas in  our philosophy is based on a fundamental bottomup approach to security selection with a longterm investment horizon  our process focuses on identifying securities offering secular growth characteristics strong financial bases reasonable valuations and downside risk our longterm approach deemphasizes the shortterm impact of daytoday market volatility and maintains a focus on the longterm potential of the securities in our portfolios providing a more consistent return with reduced volatility encourages investors to maintain market exposure and stay invested for the long run the nicholas investment style tends to appeal to investors willing to forego some upside in market cycles for a more consistent return with the potential for less downside risk  invest with nicholas funds nicholas funds offer six investment strategies that are open to investors on a direct basis via a brokerage platform or through their financial adviser we offer four equity strategies a high yield corporate fund and a money market fund a key objective for nicholas funds is to keep expense ratios low in an effort to return as much of the investment performance back to the shareholders to accommodate the different methods investors
