references  external links historyedit formationedit in  for his undergraduate thesis at princeton university john c bogle conducted a study in which he found that most mutual funds did not earn any more money than if they invested in sp  stock market index even if the stocks in the funds beat the benchmark index management fees reduced the returns to investors below the returns of the benchmark immediately after graduating from princeton university in  bogle was hired by wellington management company in  he forged a merger with a fund management group based in boston he became president in  and ceo in  however the merger ended badly and bogle was therefore fired in  bogle has said about being fired the great thing about that mistake which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified was that i learned a lot and if i had not been fired then there would not have been a vanguard bogle arranged to start a new fund division at wellington he named it vanguard after horatio nelsons flagship at the battle of the nile the hms vanguard  bogle chose this name after a dealer in antique prints left him a book about great britain’s naval achievements that featured the hms vanguard wellington executives initially resisted the name but narrowly approved it after bogle mentioned that vanguard funds would be listed alphabetically next to wellington funds growth of companyedit the wellington executives prohibited the fund from engaging in advisory or fund management services bogle saw this as an opportunity to start a passive fund tied to the performance of the sp  bogle was also inspired by paul samuelson an economist who later won the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences who wrote in an august  column in newsweek that retail investors needed an opportunity to invest in stock market indexes such as the sp  competitors which marketed highfee funds claiming to beat the market resisted vanguards low cost index approach some competitors labeled it bogles folly and some claimed it was unamerican to simply try to match the performance of the stock market rather than to try to beat it in  after getting approval from the board of directors of wellington bogle established the first index investment trust now called the vanguard  index fund it raised  million in its initial public offering compared to expectations of raising  million the banks that managed the public offering suggested that bogle cancel the fund due to the weak reception but bogle refused at this time vanguard had only three employees bogle and two analysts asset growth in the first years was slow partially because the fund did not pay commissions to brokers who sold it which was unusual at the time within a year the fund had only grown to  million in assets but one of the wellington funds that vanguard was administering had to be merged in with another fund and bogle convinced wellington to merge it in with the index fund this brought assets up to almost  million growth in assets accelerated after the beginning of the bull market in  and other mutual fund companies began to copy the indexing model these copy funds were not successful since they typically charged high fees which defeated the purpose of index funds in december  vanguard launched its second mutual fund a bond index fund called the total bond fund which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors one earlier criticism of the first index fund was that it was only an index of the sp  in december  vanguard launched its third fund the vanguard extended market index fund an index fund of the entire stock market excluding the sp  over the next five years other funds were launched including a small cap index fund an international stock index fund and a total stock market index fund during the s more funds were offered and several vanguard funds including the sp  index fund and the total stock market fund became among the largest funds in the world and vanguard became the largest mutual fund company in the world noted investor john neff retired as manager of vanguards windsor fund in  after a  year career in which his fund beat returns of the sp  index by an average of  basis points per year recentedit bogle retired from vanguard as chairman in  when he reached the companys mandatory retirement age of

mutual funds that bogle preferred in particular into etfs and activelymanaged fundscitation needed on may   it was reported that vanguard had launched in the united kingdom and would begin marketing its lowcost funds directly to retail clients the press reported that uk rivals experienced drops in share value as a result with an analyst quoted saying vanguard’s plan to shake up the uk investment market with online lowcost direct access to its funds could spark a gamechanging price war that stings brokers and fund managers alike at the time vanguard had  trillion of assets under management and
