statements no assurances intended   this report contains certain forwardlooking statements regarding usa zhimingde international group corporation its business and financial prospects these statements represent management’s best estimate of what will happen nevertheless there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ dramatically from the results suggested in this report among the more significant risks are   ● we have no business operations and have no assets unless the company obtains additional capital or acquires an operating company the company will not be able to undertake significant business activities   ● the company’s business plan contemplates that it will acquire an operating company in exchange for common stock if that occurs management will determine the nature of the company that is acquired which is likely to be a company with which management has a preexisting relationship investors in the company will have to rely on the business acumen of management in determining that the acquisition is in the best interest of the company if management lacks sufficient skill to operate successfully the company’s shares may lose value   because these and other risks may cause the company’s actual results to differ from those anticipated by management the reader should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that appear in this report   part    item  business   usa zhimingde international group corporation the “company” was originally incorporated on july   in accordance with the laws of the state of

company changed its name to usa zhimingde international group corporation effective on february     for some period of time the company has been exploring business opportunities that would involve the use of the company as a shell in a reverse merger transaction in which an operating company would be merged into usa zhimingde international group corporation in exchange for shares of our capital stock we continue to explore business opportunities particularly businesses with which our chairman zhongquan zou has experience the business that we ultimately pursue will be determined by mr zou who is the sole member of our board of directors his decision will be based on the prospects for the business the availability of capital to fund the business and the potential benefits of the business to the shareholders of usa zhimingde international group corporation   it is likely that we will effectuate a business combination with a target whose business operations and place of formation are located in the people’s republic of china in particular we may combine with one or more entities that mr zou owns or controls in such event we may face the significant additional risks associated with doing business in that country in addition to the language barriers different presentations of financial information different business practices and other cultural differences and barriers that may make it difficult to evaluate such a merger target we may encounter ongoing business risks associated with uncertain legal systems and applications of law uncertain economic policies and potential political and economic instability   employees   we currently have no employees the need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities   item a risk factors   not applicable   item b unresolved staff comments   not applicable          item  properties   we have no property

financial condition and other factors deemed pertinent by the board of directors   d securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans   the company had no securities authorized for

repurchase of equity securities   the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the  th quarter of    item  selected financial data   not applicable   item  management’s discussion and analysis   results of operations   we currently have no assets and no operations during the year ended december   we realized no revenue and incurred  in operating expenses resulting in a loss from operations and net loss in that amount during the year ended december   we realized no revenue and incurred  in operating expenses resulting in a loss from operations and a net loss in that amount the expenses in these years represent the costs of maintaining the company as an sec reporting company as well as expenses related to maintaining the company’s corporate existence our expenses were greater in  because during the first quarter of  we filed with the sec our annual and quarterly reports for all periods from the second quarter of  through the third quarter of  and incurred the expenses related to those filings we now plan to stay current in our filing obligations and do not expect to replicate the level of those expenses until we acquire an operating business   our major expenses consisted of fees to lawyers and auditors necessary to maintain our standing as a fullyreporting public company and other administrative expenses attendant to the trading of our common stock we do not expect any significant change in the level of these expenses unless the company acquires or initiates business operations          liquidity and capital resources   at december   we had a working capital deficit of  as we had no assets and had  in accrued expenses our liabilities consist of amounts payable to our professional advisors for services which increased by  during  the remainder of our  in operating expenses during the year ended december   were paid by usa zhimingde international group inc which is our majority shareholder or by affiliates of that entity we expect our working capital deficit to continue indefinitely until we initiate or obtain an operating company capable of funding our overhead expenses   our operations used no cash during the year ended december   as we increased our accrued expenses by  during that period and the remainder of our expenses were paid by our majority shareholder as a capital contribution in the future unless we achieve the financial andor operational wherewithal to sustain our operations it is likely that we will continue to rely on loans and capital contributions to sustain our operations   mr zou our chief executive officer who controls the majority shareholder or other entities that he controls have financed our operations by making capital contributions to cover our expenses we expect that mr zou’s controlled affiliates will continue to fund our operations until we have completed an acquisition of an operating company and that we will continue to require additional capital contributions or financing to maintain our existence as a shell company for the next twelve months if necessary  our management is not required to fund our operations by any contract or other obligation   application of critical accounting policies   our financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements   our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  to our financial statements while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations the company views certain of these policies as critical policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on the company’s financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates among our critical policies is the determination described in note  to our financial statements that the company should record a valuation allowance for the full value of the deferred tax asset created by the net operating loss carryforwards the primary reason for the determination was the lack of certainty as to whether the company will achieve profitable operations in the future and be able to utilize their carryforwards          actual results may differ from those estimates our management believes that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause any effects on our results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations   impact of accounting pronouncements   there have been no recent accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material effect on our financial statements   item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item  financial statements   index to

report of independent registered public accounting firm   the board of directors and  stockholders of usa zhimingde international group corporation   we have audited the accompanying balance sheets of usa zhimingde international group corporation the “company” as of december   and  and the related statements of operations change in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended december   the company’s management is responsible for these financial statements our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits   we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement the company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence

zhimingde international group corporation   notes to financial statements in us  for the years ended december   and       accounting policies continued   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period actual results could differ from these estimates   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” section  “ income taxes ” “asc ” which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled  deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc section  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the guidance also prescribes direction on derecognition classification and accounting for interest and payables in the financial statements the company classifies interest expense and any related penalties related to income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense no interest or penalties have been recognized as of december   and  the company does not expect any significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date        usa zhimingde

income loss per common share in accordance with fasb asc  “ earnings per share ” “asc ”  under the provisions of asc  basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period  diluted income per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of any dilutive shares outstanding during the period  potential dilutive shares are not included when the company has a loss because their inclusion would be antidilutive accordingly the number of weighted average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net loss per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations for the years ended december   and  reflected in the accompanying statements of operation there were no dilutive shares outstanding during the year ended december   and    fair value of financial instruments   the company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of asc  “ fair value measurements and disclosures ” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   asc  defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows   ● level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   ● level   inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly   ● level   inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value markets   the company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented at fair value on a recurring basis carrying values of nonderivative financial instruments including accrued expenses approximated its fair value due to the short maturity of these financial instruments there were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented        usa

extinguishment costs settlement of certain debt instruments contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period the company is currently evaluating the effect this asu will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows   in april  the fasb issued asu no  revenue with contracts with customers identifying performance obligations and licensing which is an amendment to asu no  that clarifies the aspects of identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementing guidance while retaining the related principles within those areas the implementation guidelines follow asu no    in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases the new standard establishes a rightofuse “rou” model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available this accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements   in november  the fasb issued asu no   income taxes topic  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu  which simplifies the

approximately  of federal net operating losses that may be available to offset future taxable income the federal net operating loss carryover if not utilized will expire beginning in  through  the amount and utilization of any future net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations set forth by the internal revenue code based upon an analysis of the company’s stock ownership activity through december   a change of ownership was deemed to have occurred in  this change of ownership created an annual limitation of substantially all of the company’s net operating losses which are available through    the company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is established based upon the company’s losses since inception management believes that it is more likely than not that future benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized principally due to the continuing losses from operations and the change of ownership limitations and has therefore established a full valuation allowance the valuation allowance increased by  and  during the years ended december   and  respectively   the tax years ended december    and  remain open to examination by the taxing authorities    going concern   the company has not generated any revenue nor any significant operations during the years ended december   and  the company does not have any assets as of december   as of december   the company had a working capital deficiency and a stockholders’ deficit of  the company continues to incur losses from operations and has incurred a net loss of approximately  and  during the years ended december   and  respectively these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the company’s current business plan is to seek an acquisition or merger with a private operating company however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully consummate an acquisition or merger with a private operating company or that the company will identify any debt or equity financing sources to finance a potential acquisition or merger if unable to obtain financing the company may be unable to complete its business plan and would instead delay all cash intensive activities the company will continue to be dependent on additional capital contributions from its major stockholder for cash flow which may not be available without necessary cash flow the company may become dormant during the next twelve months or until such time necessary funds could be raised        usa zhimingde international group corporation   notes to financial statements in us  for the years ended december   and       going concern continued   accordingly the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values the financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty          item  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure   not applicable   item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our chief executive officer and our only officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in ruleae promulgated by the securities and exchange commission as of december   the evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls specifically   ● there are no management controls as a single person functions as sole officer and sole member of the board of directors   ● having only one individual responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system   ● most of our accounting functions are outsourced which limits our ability to assure that our accounting policies are applied consistently   based on his evaluation he concluded that the company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective as of december     changes in internal controls  there was no change in internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule af promulgated under the securities exchange act of  identified in connection with the evaluation described in the preceding paragraph that occurred during the company’s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the securities exchange act of  we have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of december   using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” internal control – integrated framework  as a basis for our assessment   because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation          a material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected in the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting we identified three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting these material weaknesses consisted of   a        inadequate staffing and supervision within the bookkeeping operations of our company there is only one individual who is responsible for bookkeeping functions this prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system the inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews   b       outsourcing the accounting operations of our company  because there is only one person in our administration we outsource most of the accounting functions of our company to an independent accountant this accountant is not directly supervised by the company’s management this is a material weakness because it could result in differences between the accounting policies adopted by our board of directors and the accounting practices applied by the accountant   c        lack of independent control over related party transactions zhongquan zou is the sole director and sole officer of usa zhimingde international group corporation from time to time mr zou or one of his affiliates will make loans or capital contributions to finance the operations of the company the absence of other directors or officers to review these transactions is a weakness because it could lead to improper classification of such related party transactions   management does not believe that the current level of the company’s operations warrants a remediation of the weaknesses identified in this assessment however because of the above conditions management’s assessment is that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of december     this annual report does not include an attestation report from the company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s
