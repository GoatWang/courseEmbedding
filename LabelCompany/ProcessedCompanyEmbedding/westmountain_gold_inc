westmountain gold inc wmtn or the company is an exploration stage mining company determined in accordance with applicable securities and exchange commission sec guidelines which pursues gold projects that the company anticipates will have low operating costs and high returns on capital   wmtns wholly owned subsidiary terra gold corporation tgc was a joint venture partner with raven gold alaska inc raven through february   on a gold system project the tmc project on february   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary terra gold corp acquired  ownership interest in the tmc project from raven which is a wholly owned subsidiary of corvus gold inc tsxkor otcqxcorvf for  million in cash and  shares of wmtn    the company is currently focused on exploration and bulk sample mineral production from mineralized material at the tmc project in the state of alaska the tmc project consists of  alaska state mining claims plus an additional  unpatented lode mining claims held under lease subject to a  net smelter return nsr royalty to the lessor dependent upon the gold price covering  square kilometers  hectares the property is centered on an kmlong trend of gold vein occurrences  all government permits and reclamation plans for continued exploration through  were renewed and the fees to maintain the terra claims through september  were paid by the company  the property lies approximately  km westnorthwest of anchorage and is accessible via helicopter or fixedwing aircraft  the property has haul roads a mill facility and adjoining camp infrastructure a tailings pond and other infrastructure  the remote camp is powered by diesel powered generators and water is supplied to the mill by spring fed sources and yearround water well   the company is considered an exploration stage company under sec criteria because it has not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at the tmc project  accordingly as required under sec guidelines and us gaap for companies in the exploration stage substantially all expenditures in the mining properties to date have been expensed as incurred and therefore do not appear as assets on our balance sheet  the company expects construction expenditures and underground mine exploration and capital improvements will continue during  and subsequent years the company expects to remain as an exploration stage company for the foreseeable future it will not exit the exploration stage until such time that it demonstrates the existence of proven or probable reserves that meet sec guidelines likewise unless mineralized material is classified as proven or probable reserves substantially all expenditures for mine exploration and construction will continue to be expensed as incurred   over the course of the last two years the company was in default on several occasions with respect to all of its outstanding debt including approximately  million of notes payable to boco investments llc boco our largest creditor and majority shareholder  during the initial default these notes had default interest rates of  and   during  the company engaged boco and other creditors to restructure the debt as it existed at the time so as to allow the company to focus on execution of its business plan   on may   the company received from boco a fully executed loan and note modification agreement dated as of may   the  loan modification agreement between the company its directors boco and two other creditors of the company the  loan modification agreement modified all outstanding loan agreements security agreements and related promissory notes between the company and boco collectively the loan documents that were previously in default and extended the repayment and maturity dates over the course of a three year period in addition to lowering the annual interest rate on all boco notes to    as part of the  loan modification agreement boco agreed to convert  in unpaid interest plus principal of  into shares of the companys common stock at a price per share of  such conversion was effected on may   and the company issued  shares of its common stock as a result of such conversion      the company had a total of  of principal payments to boco due on november   pursuant to the  loan modification agreement which boco extended to december    the company was unable to make these payments and again defaulted on all notes to boco  as of the date of this default the notes payable to boco accrued interest at various default interest rates of  per annum  per annum and  per annum  in may  the company received from boco a notice of default and demand for immediate payment in full of the notes and subsequently engaged boco to resolve the matter   at that time the following promissory notes made by the company in favor of boco collectively the notes were in default   · september   amended and restated secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of  the september  note     · may   promissory note in the principal amount of  the may  note     · june   promissory note in the principal amount of  the june  note     · february

the effective date the company and boco entered into and closed a loan and note modification agreement the modification agreement to resolve the default and restructure the debt due under the notes  the total amount due under the notes immediately prior to entering into the modification agreement was approximately    pursuant to the modification agreement boco waived all current defaults and default interest due on the notes  additionally boco converted all outstanding principal and interest due under the may  note and june  note totaling  into  shares of the companys common stock par value  at a conversion rate of  per share  as a result of the conversion the may  note and june  note were canceled   furthermore pursuant to the modification agreement the base interest rate was decreased from  to  as of the effective date on the following notes the may  note the june  note the february  note the may  note the june  note the march  note and the april  note  the base interest rate of the september  note collectively with the may  note the june  note the february  note the may  note the june  note the march  note and the april  note the remaining notes remains at  per annum  with respect to the remaining notes in the event of a default under the modification agreement any of the remaining notes or agreements related thereto the default interest rate was adjusted to the maximum interest rate allowable under colorado law  as of the effective date the remaining notes will accrue interest at their respective base interest rates   additionally the modification agreement extended the maturity date of the following notes to december   the may  note the june  note the may  note the june  note and the march  note  the maturity date for the other remaining notes remains unchanged as follows the september  note due on november   the february  note due on november   and the april  note due on october        the remaining notes continue to be secured by the

collectively the security agreements  furthermore boco retains certain protective and oversight rights over company operations and requires the company to maintain covenants that are substantially similar to the protective and oversight rights and covenants contained in the prior  loan and note modification agreement   as part of the modification agreement the company appointed richard bloom and brian klemsz as directors of the company to serve until the next election of directors   the preceding descriptions of the modification agreement the notes and the security agreements are incomplete and qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the modification agreement the notes and the security agreements respectively which were attached as exhibits to previously filed reporting documents of the company   as of july   the company had eight secured promissory notes with boco investments llc and has recorded  in principal plus  in accrued interest   additionally on august   the company and boco entered into a second amendment to secured promissory note the boco amendment amending the april  note the boco amendment increases the maximum amount of the line of credit from six hundred forty thousand dollars  to one million dollars   all other terms of the april  note remain unchanged  since august   the company has drawn advances in the aggregate amount of two hundred twentyfive thousand dollars  from boco on the increased credit line see note  subsequent events for further discussion   on november   the company and boco entered into a secured promissory note in the principal amount of  the november  note  the november  note accrues interest at  per annum and is due in full on november   see note  subsequent events for further discussion    as further discussed below in note  going concern and note  subsequent events the company is currently in default under the promissory notes held by boco under the terms of each such promissory note and the modification agreement as described in note  promissory notes for failure to make payments when due as of november    boco has not made a demand for payment or otherwise indicated an intent to initiate foreclosure activities as of the date of this quarterly report   notice of violation from alaska department of natural resources   on october   we received a notice of violation correspondence together with follow up correspondence from adnr received december   the notice of violation from the alaska department of natural resources adnr the notice of violation was addressed to our wholly owned subsidiary terra gold corporation which holds the miscellaneous land use permit mlup pursuant to which we operate at the tmc project  the notice of violation was issued pursuant to a july   adnr site visit inspection at the tmc project the site visit   the notice of violation cited several significant observations made by adnr representatives during the site visit that required the company to take corrective action  failure to take all corrective action required by the notice of violation could result in revocation of the mlup which would require us to vacate the tmc project  in response to the notice of violation the company took the following corrective action           the company submitted a report to adnr regarding a petroleum release that occurred at the tmc project during late july that was non reportable           the company submitted a report to adnr regarding the slough event described in further detail above confirming that the company ceased operations at the bulk sample mine site at the tmc project in accordance with applicable regulations  a courtesy copy of the report was voluntarily provided to the us department of labor and the mine safety health administration                the company submitted to adnr an amendment to our plan of operations previously submitted with the application for permits to min in alaska apma  the purpose of the amendment was to add our mill schematics and to include additional settling ponds and baseline water sample data acid base analysis from the tmc project  additionally the company submitted to adnr original lab results of all baseline data as well as lab custody documentation and a map identifying the sampling locations           the company constructed additional secondary containment structures for hazardous material containers in compliance with applicable regulations  additionally all barrels and other containers holding hazardous materials were labeled and placed into secondary containment in accordance with applicable regulations           the company submitted to adnr a work plan detailing revisions to the road grade at the tmc project to bring all road grades in compliance with applicable regulations           the company obtained and submitted to adnr estimates of costs for reclamation work that must be completed at the tmc project   based on the reclamation work estimates adnr requires the company to obtain a performance guarantee related to the reclamation and rehabilitation work required at the tmc project  the company must obtain the performance guarantee in the approximate amount of  no later than february    the performance guarantee may be in the form of a personal bond accompanied by a letter of credit certificate of deposit in favor of adnr or cash deposit in the amount of the bond in the form of a corporate surety bond or other security acceptable to adnr with bocos conditional provision of the performance guarantee as further discussed below the company received correspondence from adnr dated february   confirming it has satisfied all of the requirements set forth in the notice of violation   as of the date of this quarterly report the company believes that its assets alone are not sufficient to satisfy the performance guarantee  the company will need to rely on boco to maintain the performance guarantee as further discussed below and ultimately to raise capital through the issuance of equity andor debt as the principal source of liquidity to satisfy the performance guarantee on its own  the companys prospects of raising capital now are greatly diminished due to several factors including the recent substantial write down of company assets as described throughout the notes above the improbability of generating substantial revenue soon due to the cessation of operations at the tmc project resulting from the september  slough event as described in this footnote  above and the companys current capital structure  if the company fails to satisfy the performance guarantee as required by adnr the companys mlup will likely be revoked and the company will lose access to the tmc project  in light of the circumstances the company is considering all avenues with regard to the performance guarantee and our loans and other outstanding obligations  since our ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within our control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   no assurance can be given that the company will in fact be able to raise the required capital in a timely manner or that the proposed terms of any such financing will be favorable or acceptable to the company  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining or agreeing to financing the company may be forced to discontinue all operations and will fail which will likely result in the companys shareholders losing their entire investment   boco provision of performance guarantee   on january   the company its wholly owned subsidiary terra gold corporation tgc and boco entered into a pledge agreement the pledge agreement pursuant to which boco agreed to provide on behalf of the company the performance guarantee as required by adnr for a period of at least  years and  week  boco agreed to provide a certificate of deposit in the full amount of the performance guarantee  the cd which was pledged to and accepted by adnr on february     boco maintains rights to the full amount of the cd and is entitled to all interest generated by the cd the principal and all interest generated by not paid to boco the guaranteed amount  in consideration of boco posting the cd as the performance guarantee the company is required to pay boco an annual fee calculated as  of the maximum guaranteed amount during the prior one year period the guaranty fee which will be prorated in the event of a partial year  the initial guaranty fee in the amount of  became payable on the date the cd was pledged and has not yet been paid   additionally the company must take steps to replace the boco cd within two years and protect against adnr taking deductions from the cd  in the event adnr does take a deduction from the cd the company will be required to immediately repay boco in full for the deduction and cause the release of the remaining amount of the cd from the performance guarantee  finally the company tgc fidelity title company as trustee and boco also entered a deed of trust security agreement assignment of production rents and leasehold interests financing statement and fixture filing dated january   the deed of trust  the deed of trust secures the companys obligations under the pledge agreement in the full amount of the cd by providing to boco a general security interest over all assets of the company including all the companys rights related to the entire tmc project including all related mining claims and leases the companys after acquired property interests and all gold silver and other ores and minerals extracted by the company  in the event of the companys default of the pledge agreement boco will have the right to foreclose on all the assets of the company without the necessity of going to court      as of the date of this quarterly report boco is or has rights to become the beneficial owner of approximately  of the issued and outstanding shares of the companys common stock and is the primary creditor of the company  the preceding descriptions of the pledge agreement and the deed of trust are incomplete and qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the pledge agreement and the deed of trust respectively which are attached as exhibits to this quarterly report   note   going concern   the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future  the company has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of july   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business  accordingly there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern   the companys principal source of liquidity for the next several years will need to be the continued raising of capital through the issuance of equity or debt  wmtn plans to raise funds for each step of the tmc project and as each step is successfully completed raise the capital for the next phase  wmtn believes this will reduce the cost of capital as compared to trying to raise all the anticipated capital at once up front  however given the recent slough event at the tmc project the company is currently evaluating its options for alternative revenue generating operations  these evaluations may result in a change of the companys current business plan including the possible acceleration of implementing underground mining development and capital raising to fund those activities as further discussed in note  subsequent events  alternatively the company may choose to scale back operations to operate at breakeven with a smaller level of business activity while adjusting overhead depending on the availability of additional financing since wmtns ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within the companys control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on february   no assurance can be given that wmtn will in fact be able to raise the additional capital as it is needed   the company is currently in default under the promissory notes held by boco under the terms of each such promissory note and the modification agreement as described in note  promissory notes for failure to make payments when due as of november    boco has not made a demand for payment or otherwise indicated an intent to initiate foreclosure activities as of the date of this quarterly report  the company currently has insufficient funds to pay any amount on the boco promissory notes and will need to raise capital through the issuance of equity andor debt as the principal source of liquidity to make such payments see note  subsequent events for additional discussion    the company is considering all avenues with regard to satisfying its obligations under the promissory notes and provide the required performance guarantee bond  since our ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within our control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   no assurance can be given that the company will in fact be able to raise the required capital in a timely manner or that the proposed terms of any such financing will be favorable or on terms acceptable to the company  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining or agreeing to financing the company may be forced to discontinue all operations and will fail which will likely result in the companys shareholders losing their entire investment  accordingly there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern      unaudited financial statements   the accompanying

furniture and fixtures and software which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed by the straightline method over the estimated useful lives or lease period of the relevant asset generally   years   metal and other inventory inventories were  and  as of july   and october   respectively inventories may include ore stockpiles in process inventory doré and gold bullion the inventory at july   and october   was represented by ore stockpiles  all inventories as of july   and october   are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method metal inventory costs include direct labor materials depreciation as well as overhead costs directly relating to mining activities   mineral properties costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalized by project area upon purchase of the associated claims costs to maintain the mineral rights are expensed as incurred  when a property reaches the production stage the related capitalized costs will be amortized using the units of production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves  bulk sampling operations to date have been de minimis therefore no amortization has been recorded   longlived assets the company reviews its longlived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable longlived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the projected cost associated with selling the asset to the extent carrying values exceed fair values an impairment loss is recognized in operating results   given the operational challenges encountered during the  mining season to date and the valuation of the companys common stock see note  certain relations and related party transactions the company engaged a valuation firm to assist in the valuation of the companys common stock the valuation concluded that the fair value of the common stock was de minimis thus the company concluded that the mining claims should also be recorded with a fair value of de minimis and accordingly recorded an impairment of the full value of the mining claims in the amount of  as of july    impairments recognized as of july   and october   are  and  respectively      alaska reclamation and remediation liabilities the company operates in alaska the state of alaska department of natural resources requires a pool of funds from all permittees with exploration and mining projects to cover reclamation there is a  per acre disturbance reclamation bond that is required for disturbance of  acres or more andor removal of more than  cubic yards of material the companys asset retirement obligation aro consisting of estimated future mine reclamation and closure costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations mine plans estimates or other factors the companys aro is recognized as a liability at fair value in the period incurred an aro which is initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates is accreted to full value over time through charges to accretion expense resultant aro cost assets are depreciated on a unitsofproduction method over the related longlived assets useful life the companys aro is adjusted annually or more frequently at interim periods if necessary to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs   fair value measurements asc topic  fair value measurement and disclosures  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date  this topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entitys own assumptions unobservable inputs  the hierarchy consists of three levels   level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   level   inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable and   level   unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use   liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows                         carrying amount at july     fair value measurements using inputs   financial instruments level    level    level                            liabilities                       forward contract               derivative instruments               total                                    carrying amount at october     fair value measurements using inputs   financial instruments level    level    level                            liabilities                       forward contract               derivative instruments               total                  the estimated fair value of common stock used to measure the derivative instruments at october     july     october       estimated fair value of common stock       exercise price       expected term years         dividend yield         expected volatility         riskfree interest rate           the recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at july   and october   based upon the shortterm nature of the assets and liabilities    embedded derivatives the company has entered into certain financial instruments and contracts such as convertible note financing arrangements that contained embedded derivative features because the economic characteristics and risks of the equitylinked conversion options were not clearly and closely related to a debttype host the conversion features required classification and measurement as derivative financial instruments the convertible note financing arrangements were carried as derivative liabilities at fair value in the financial statements until their conversion into common stock the company estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative features in the convertible notes by using probability weighted scenarios on the conversion price with a black scholes model  as of july   the company concluded that embedded derivative features no longer met the definition of a derivative  the liability recorded for these embedded derivatives as of july   and october   was  and  respectively   during the three and nine months ended july   the company recognized  and  of other income this is partially a result of a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivatives from may   and october   respectively   forward sale and loan agreements on march   the company entered into forward sale and loan agreements with three accredited investors for an aggregate loan of  the company was required to tender no less than  ounces of gold in bar form to the three accredited investors by september   but

llc who is owed  payable in cash or gold together with interest thereon from september    the company paid snowmass the sum of  during the year ended october     as of july   the value of the gold obligation to snowmass is   the difference between the amount received and the fair value of the obligation will be recorded as additional interest expense or income at each reporting date based on the fair value of gold  during the quarter ended july   the company recorded additional interest expense of  for the change in the value of gold from april   during the nine months ended july   the company recorded additional interest expense of  for the change in the value of gold from october     revenue recognition    revenue is recognized net of royalties when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable no obligations remain and collection is probable the passing of title to the customer is based on the terms of the sales contract and the actual sale of gold bullion product pricing is determined at the point revenue is recognized by reference to active and freely traded commodity markets for example the london bullion market for both gold and silver in an identical form to the product sold   mineral exploration and development costs all exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred  significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized  if no minable ore body is discovered previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period the property is abandoned  expenditures to develop new mines to define further mineralization in existing ore bodies and to expand the capacity of operating mines will be capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over proven and probable reserves   should a property be abandoned its capitalized costs are charged to operations  the company charges to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs attributable to properties abandoned  capitalized costs are allocated to properties sold based on the proportion of claims sold to the claims remaining within the project area   net loss per share basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented  diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the income of the company subject to antidilution limitations as of july   the company had i warrants for the purchase of  common shares ii  common shares related to convertible promissory notes and iii  common shares related to the conversion of series a convertible preferred stock iv options for the purchase of  common shares which were considered but were not included in the computation of loss per share at july   because they would have been antidilutive   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period   the most significant estimates relate to the determination of gold contained in stockpiled ore inventory assumptions used in the companys impairment assessment of longlived assets the estimated fair value of derivatives the estimation of asset retirement obligations estimates of the fair value of the companys common stock assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock based compensation and depreciation of buildings and equipment these estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available   reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation these reclassifications had no effect on previously reported assets liabilities net cash flows or net loss      stockbased compensation fasb asc  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services but primarily focuses on transactions whereby an entity obtains employee services for sharebased payments fasb asc  requires that the compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments   the companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of fasb asc    the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement stockbased compensation related to nonemployees is accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services whichever is more readily determinable in accordance with fasb asc    income taxdeferred tax  fasb asc  requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes the deferred tax balances are adjusted to reflect tax rates by tax jurisdiction based on currently enacted tax laws which will be in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse under fasb asc  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations westmountain gold inc has recognized deferred income tax benefits on net operating loss carryforwards to the extent westmountain gold inc believes it will be able to utilize them in future tax filings the company has applied a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets the difference between the statutory income tax expense and the accounting tax expense is primarily attributable to nondeductible expenses representing permanent timing differences between book income and taxable income during the nine months ended july     recent accounting pronouncements   asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic    this asu affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards eg insurance contracts or lease contracts this asu will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in topic  revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance this asu also supersedes some cost guidance included in subtopic  revenue recognition  constructiontype and productiontype contracts in addition the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer eg assets within the scope of topic  property plant and equipment and tangible assets within the scope of topic  intangibles  goodwill and other are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement including the constraint on revenue in this asu   the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services to achieve that core principle an entity should apply the following steps     · identify the contracts with a customer     · identify the performance obligations in the contract        · determine the transaction price     · allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract     · recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation   the amendments in this asu are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period the company is evaluating the effect this asu may have on its consolidated financial statements   asu no  presentation of financial statements  going concern subtopic    disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern which is intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures this standard will be effective for the company beginning the quarter ending on january   early application is permitted  the company is evaluating the effect this asu may have on its consolidated financial statements   asu  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes   this update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position asu  is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods therein beginning after december   this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period the company is evaluating the effect this asu may have on its consolidated financial statements   fasb accounting standards update no  leases topic    under the new guidance lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases at the commencement date   · a lease liability which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and   · a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term   under the new guidance lessor accounting is largely unchanged certain targeted improvements were made to align where necessary lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and topic  revenue from contracts with customers   the new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities lessees will no longer be provided with a source of offbalance sheet financing  the company is evaluating the effect this asu may have on its consolidated financial statements   note  agreements   exploration development and mine operating agreements   amended claims and lease agreements with ben porterfield

or otherwise indicated an intent to initiate foreclosure activities as of the date of this quarterly report  the company currently has insufficient funds to pay any amount on the boco promissory notes

its obligations under the promissory notes  since our ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within our control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   no assurance can be given that the company will in fact be able to raise the required capital in a timely manner or that the proposed terms of any such financing will be favorable or acceptable to the company  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining or agreeing to financing the company may be forced to discontinue all operations and will fail which will likely result in the companys shareholders losing their entire investment  accordingly there is a substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern   slough event   westmountain gold inc the company recently experienced a significant slough event at its mining property located in alaska referred to in our prior periodic filings as the tmc project or terra  the slough event occurred sometime between the evening hours of september   and the early afternoon hours of september   in the area of the tmc project where the company was conducting bulk surface sampling operations  no injuries were reported and no equipment was lost or damaged as a result of the significant slough event due to the company taking safety precautions to evacuate that area after earlier minor slough events  however the slough event caused approximately  tons of rock material to completely cover the main vein in the bulk surface sampling area      due to the extensive coverage and ongoing safety concerns in this area caused by the slough event the company ceased all surface bulk sampling operations at the tmc project and believes it is likely that the surface bulk sampling operations at the tmc project will remain closed permanently  the companys strategy had been to use cash flow generated from its surface bulk sampling operations to help fund the expansion of resources and the pursuit of underground mining development at the tmc project  if surface bulk sampling operations remain closed permanently or for any extended period of time the company will be forced to change its business plan which may include implementing underground mining development sooner than expected and relying solely on that underground mining development to exploit the tmc project and generate revenues  additionally in the absence of expected revenues from surface bulk sampling operations the company believes it will be necessary to raise more equity or debt financing than originally planned to commence underground mining development  we expect the build out of such operations would cost a minimum of  to  and that commencement of underground development could occur no earlier than june   accordingly the company will likely remain in the exploration stage of its mining operations longer than originally anticipated   the companys  operations plan the  operations plan included as an exhibit to the companys current report on form k dated january   relied on revenue expected to be generated almost exclusively from our surface bulk sampling operations at the tmc project to fund our operational costs for the  season and other upcoming obligations  prior to the slough event we excavated approximately  tons of vein material from our surface bulk sampling operations compared to  to  tons that we expected to mine from the surface sampling operations for the entire  season  to date we have processed approximately  tons of vein material including vein material remaining from the  season and have an estimated additional  tons of vein material that has yet to be processed  even if we are able to process the estimated remaining  tons of vein material our total processed tonnage will fall well short of the  tons projected in the  operations plan  due to the decrease in actual excavated vein material compared to expected excavated vein material caused by the slough event actual revenues for the  season will fall well short of the companys projections set forth in the  operations plan   as a result of the expected reduced revenue caused by the slough event the company will most likely be unable to fund future operational costs including planning and commencement of any potential underground mining development  additionally we will likely be unable to meet certain loan obligations that come due in  and are secured by the assets of the company a full description of the companys outstanding loans may be found in note  promissory notes  failure to pay the loan obligations when they come due may result in the lenders accelerating all amounts due and foreclosing on the assets of the company to satisfy the balances  if foreclosure occurs it will likely result in the companys shareholders losing their entire investment   with the complete cessation of surface bulk sampling operations at the tmc project and no immediate prospects for alternative surface bulk sample operations the companys potential revenue stream is limited to the remaining vein material that has already been excavated and is either currently in process or waiting to be processed  because the company expects this revenue will be insufficient to fund our current and future operational expenses and obligations the company is currently assessing its options  it is likely that the company will need to raise additional new capital through the issuance of equity andor debt in the near term to fund our loan obligations and continue operations in addition to the capital that would need to be raised for the commencement of underground mining development at the tmc project  since our ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within our control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   no assurance can be given that the company will in fact be able to raise the required capital in a timely manner or that the proposed terms of any such financing will be favorable or acceptable to the company  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining or agreeing to financing the company may be forced to discontinue all operations and will fail which will likely result in the companys shareholders losing their entire investment   notice of violation from alaska department of natural resources   on october   we received a notice of violation correspondence together with follow up correspondence from adnr received december   the notice of violation from the alaska department of natural resources adnr the notice of violation was addressed to our wholly owned subsidiary terra gold corporation which holds the miscellaneous land use permit mlup pursuant to which we operate at the tmc project  the notice of violation was issued pursuant to a july   adnr site visit inspection at the tmc project the site visit      the notice of violation cited several significant observations made by adnr representatives during the site visit that required the company to take corrective action  failure to take all corrective action required by the notice of violation could result in revocation of the mlup which would require us to vacate the tmc project  in response to the notice of violation the company took corrective action   the alaska department of natural resources recently notified the company that we must provide a performance guarantee bond related to reclamation and rehabilitation work required at the tmc project  the company must provide the performance guarantee in the approximate amount of  no later than february    while the company believes that its assets are not sufficient to satisfy the performance guarantee bond and we will likely need to raise capital through the issuance of equity andor debt as the principal source of liquidity to satisfy the performance guarantee bond boco has agreed to temporarily provide the performance guarantee bond on behalf of the company see note  business for additional discussion  in a correspondence from adnr dated february   the company received confirmation that it has satisfied all of the requirements set forth in

company   the preceding descriptions of the modification agreement the notes and the security agreements are incomplete and qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the modification agreement the notes and the security agreements respectively which were attached as exhibits to previously filed reporting documents of the company      c                  business of issuer   we intend to devote substantially all of our efforts on growing the companys operations in the mineral exploration and mining sector  we are currently focused on further exploration of the tmc project for mineral reserves and to gauge the prospects for efficient mining operations if such reserves are discovered  additionally we are engaged in limited extraction and exploitation of mineralized material through surface mining techniques at the tmc project our primary key market priority will be to proceed with the tmc project and other mining opportunities that may present themselves from time to time we cannot guarantee that the tmc project or any project that we embark upon will be successful    we are currently considered an exploration stage company under sec criteria because it has not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at the tmc project  accordingly as required under sec guidelines and us gaap for companies in the exploration stage substantially all of our investment in mining properties to date including construction of the mill mine facilities and exploration expenditures have been expensed as incurred and therefore do not appear as assets on our balance sheet  due to the adverse effect of the recent slough event on our operations and ability to effectively exploit the tmc project we are currently assessing our operational options and are unsure whether construction expenditures underground mine exploration and capital improvements will continue in the foreseeable future we expect to remain as an exploration stage company for the foreseeable future we do not exit the exploration stage until such time that we demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves that meet sec guidelines likewise unless mineralized material is classified as proven or probable reserves substantially all expenditures for mine exploration and construction will continue to be expensed as incurred   in light of the recent slough event at the tmc project as well as other significant events that adversely affect the companys capabilities to raise capital and commence operations as further discussed above and in notes  business and  subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements many of the existing plans and expectations of the companys management are unlikely to be realized and the company is currently evaluating its business plan and options for alternative revenue generating operations  our analysis may result in a change of the companys current business plan from what is described in this item  and the descriptions of our business in reports previously filed by the company including the possible acceleration of implementing underground mining development and capital raising to fund those activities as further discussed in note  to the accompanying financial statements subsequent events  due to the slough event we have ceased operations at the tmc project and have not yet determined whether we will be able to recommence operations there in the coming season   moreover we expect that we will need to raise additional funds to respond to our immediate obligations and if we decide to pursue recommencing operations at the tmc project more rapid underground mining expansion appropriate responses to competitive pressures or the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies or if we must respond to unanticipated events that require us to make additional investments however in light of the recent developments for the company including among other factors the slough event the impairment of mining claims and requirement of a substantial performance guarantee by alaska department of natural resources see notes  business and  subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these factors and events the company is considering all avenues with regard to our ability to satisfy the performance guarantee and our loans and other outstanding obligations as well as potential future operations  since our ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within our control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   no assurance can be given that wmtn will in fact be able to raise the additional capital as it is needed   in addition to the challenges discussed above we are exposed to various risks related to the volatility of the price of gold our need for additional financing our joint venture agreements our reserve estimates operating as a going concern unique difficulties and uncertainties in mining exploration ventures and a volatile market price for our common stock these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail below in this report and the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february           results of operations   as we are an early stage company we have commenced only limited operations and have yet to reach full operations therefore we have little operations to report at this time  our main focus has been on the development of our business plan  our seasonal operations currently consist solely of surface mining and processing of mineralized material at the tmc project and the sale of commercially viable minerals recovered from such activities   comparison of three months ended july   to three months ended july     revenue   revenue for the three months ended july   decreased  to  as compared to  for the three months ended july    the companys  season operations commenced during the three months ended july   however we experienced various operational problems at the beginning of the season which delayed our revenue generating activities at the tmc project  due to these operational problems and corresponding delay in commencement of revenue generating activities revenue dropped substantially for the three months ended july   as compared to the three months ended july    because of the seasonality of the companys operations revenue during the quarters ended july  are expected to be minimal until we are able to commence yearround operations   as of july   the company had ore inventory valued at      cost of sales   cost of sales for the three months ended july   decreased  to  as compared to  for the three months ended july    this decrease is primarily related to the lower revenues during the three months ended july   compared to the three months ended july      expenses   selling general and administrative expenses for the three months ended july   decreased  to  as compared to  for the three months ended july    such expenses for the three months ended july   and  consisted primarily of employee and independent contractor expenses expenses related to share and warrant issuances rent audit overhead amortization and depreciation professional and consulting fees sales and marketing costs investor relations legal and other general and administrative costs  the main decrease was due to the options granted in may  being valued at de minimis   net loss   net loss for the three months ended july   was  as compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended july   the main variance is associated with an increase in interest expense impairment of the mining claims and decrease in gross profit partially offset by a gain on the change to the company derivative liabilities   comparison of nine months ended july   to nine months ended july     revenue   revenue for the nine months ended july   decreased  to  as compared to  for the nine months ended july    during the fiscal year ended october   we were unable to sell all gold processed as a result of the  season  this unsold gold was subsequently sold during the nine months ended july   generating higher than normal revenue for that period  during  we improved our gold sale process and were able to sell all of our gold bullion inventory for the  season during the fiscal year ended october    additionally we experienced various operational problems at the beginning of the  season which delayed our revenue generating activities at the tmc project during the three months ended july    due to the process improvements made during  and the operational issues experienced during the three months ended july   revenue dropped substantially for the nine months ended july   as compared to the nine months ended july    because of the seasonality of the companys operations revenue during the nine month periods ended july  are expected to be minimal until we are able to commence yearround operations      as of july   the company had ore inventory valued at    cost of sales   cost of sales for the nine months ended july   decreased  to  as compared to  for the nine months ended july    this decrease was attributable the fact that some of the sales for the nine months ended july   were the result of reprocessing ore concentrates for which the costs were accounted for during the original milling process  the cost of sales for the nine months ended july   was the result of high amounts of unsold gold from the  season due to poor gold sales processes which were subsequently improved during the  season   expenses   selling general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended july   increased  to  as compared to  for the nine months ended july    such expenses for the nine months ended july   and  consisted primarily of employee and independent contractor expenses expenses related to share and warrant issuances rent audit overhead amortization and depreciation professional and consulting fees sales and marketing costs investor relations legal and other general and administrative costs the main decrease was due to the options granted in may  being valued at de minimis   net loss   net loss for the nine months ended july   was  as compared to a net loss of  for the nine months ended july   the net loss for the nine months ended july   included  of noncash expenses comprised of  in expenses related to stock option expense  related to depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  related to the amortization of debt discount  related to accretion expense  related to the impairment of the company mining claims  gain on our derivative liability and  other expense the net loss for the nine months ended july   included  of noncash expenses comprised of  gain on derivative liability  of stock option expense  related to depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  related to amortization of debt discount and  gain on forward contract     the increase in net loss was due to a combination of an increase in interest expense impairment of the mining claims and decrease in gross profit partially offset by a gain on the change to the company derivative liabilities  as discussed above any expectation of the companys ability to maintain stable operating expenses or grow revenue moving forward will likely be adversely affected by the slough event that occurred at the tmc project in september  and any potential changes to the companys business plan as a result of the slough event see note  to the accompanying financial statements subsequent events   liquidity and capital resources   as of july   we had a working capital deficit of approximately   we had a cash balance of  prepaid expenses of  and ore inventory of  offset by current liabilities of   current liabilities consisted of a forward contract of  promissory notes and line of credit of  accumulated interest of  and accounts payable and accrued expenses of  as of july     over the course of the last two years the company was in default on several occasions with respect to all of its outstanding debt including approximately  million of debt to boco our largest creditor and majority shareholder  during the initial default these notes had default interest rates of  and  during  the company engaged boco and our other creditors to restructure our debt as it existed at the time so as to allow the company to focus on execution of its business plan and put us on a path to repay our debts over a reasonable amount of time we entered into a loan and note modification agreement the  loan modification agreement with our directors boco and two other creditors on may   see note  to the accompanying financial statements business for more details      on december   the company again defaulted on the notes subject to the  loan modification agreement due to nonpayment  as of the date of this default the notes payable to boco accrued interest at various default interest rates of  per annum  per annum and  per annum  in may  the company received from boco a notice of default and demand for immediate payment in full of the notes and subsequently engaged boco to resolve the matter  on june   the company and boco entered into and closed the modification agreement as described more fully in part b of this item   material transactions and other significant business transactions overview  to resolve the default and restructure the debt  as of july   we have a total of  in outstanding principal not inclusive of accrued interest due to various parties pursuant to promissory notes including  in principal due to boco  the company is again in default of these notes pursuant to the june   modification agreement due to failure to make a payment when it became due on november    see note  to the accompanying financial statements subsequent events for more details   in the course of its startup activities the company has sustained operating losses  expenses incurred from october   date of inception through july   relate primarily to the companys formation general administrative activities property acquisition and limited operations  although our limited operations had begun to generate revenue which provided some capital and liquidity for the company there can be no assurance if and when such revenue will be sufficient to fully support our operations in light of the slough event that ceased our operations  therefore we will need to continue raising of capital through the issuance of equity andor debt as our principal source of liquidity over the next several years to fund recommencing of operations and growth  the company had planned to raise funds for each step of the project in an effort to reduce the cost of capital as compared to trying to raise all the anticipated capital at once up front  however in light of the recent developments for the company including among other factors the slough event the impairment of mining claims and requirement of a substantial performance guarantee by alaska department of natural resources see notes  business and  subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these factors and events the company is considering all avenues with regard to our ability to satisfy the performance guarantee and our loans and other outstanding obligations  since our ability to raise additional capital will be affected by many factors most of which are not within our control including the risk factors set forth in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   no assurance can be given that wmtn will in fact be able to raise the additional capital as it is needed   in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october   as filed with the sec on february   our independent registered accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of the companys history of net loss our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute the plans to pursue the tmc project as described in this form q the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time the companys consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our business   our primary activity will be to proceed with the tmc project and other mining opportunities that may present themselves from time to time we cannot guarantee that the tmc project will be successful or that any project that we embark upon will be successful our goal is to build our company into a successful mineral exploration and development company    in light of the recent slough event at the tmc project as well as other significant events that adversely affect the companys capabilities to raise capital and commence operations see notes  business and  subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these factors and events many of the existing plans and expectations of the companys management as described above are unlikely to be realized the company is currently evaluating its options for alternative revenue generating operations and addressing our significant liabilities  these evaluations may result in a change of the companys current business plan from what is described in this item  and the descriptions of our business in reports previously filed by the company including the possible acceleration of implementing underground mining development and capital raising to

reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the companys financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors   inflation   we do not believe that inflation has had in the past or will have in the future any significant negative impact on the companys operations        critical accounting policies and estimates   mineral properties costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalized by project area upon purchase of the associated claims costs to maintain the mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred  when a property reaches the production stage the related capitalized costs will be amortized using the units of production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves  bulk sampling operations to date have been de minimis therefore no amortization has been recorded   longlived assets we review our longlived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable longlived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the projected cost associated with selling the asset to the extent carrying values exceed fair values an impairment loss is recognized in operating results    given the operational challenges encountered during the  mining season to date and the valuation of the companys common stock see note  certain relations and related party transactions the company engaged a valuation firm to assist in the valuation of the companys common stock the valuation concluded that the fair value of the common stock was de minimis thus the company concluded that the mining claims should also be recorded with a fair value of de minimis and accordingly recorded an impairment of the full value of the mining claims in the amount of  as of july    impairments recognized as of july   and october   are  and  respectively   alaska reclamation and remediation liabilities the company operates in alaska the state of alaska department of natural resources requires a pool of funds from all permittees with exploration and mining projects to cover reclamation there is a  per acre disturbance reclamation bond that is required for disturbance of  acres or more andor removal of more than  cubic yards of material the companys asset retirement obligation aro consisting of estimated future mine reclamation and closure costs may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in regulations mine plans estimates or other factors the companys aro is recognized as a liability at fair value in the period incurred an aro which is initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates is accreted to full value over time through charges to accretion expense resultant aro cost assets are depreciated on a unitsofproduction method over the related longlived assets useful life the companys aro is adjusted annually or more frequently at interim periods if necessary to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs    fair value measurements asc topic  fair value measurement and disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date  this topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entitys own assumptions unobservable inputs  the hierarchy consists of three levels   level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities   level   inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable and   level   unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized net of royalties when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable no obligations remain and collection is probable the passing of title to the customer is based on the terms of the sales contract product pricing is determined at the point revenue is recognized by reference to active and freely traded commodity markets for example the london bullion market for both gold and silver in an identical form to the product sold      metal and other inventory inventories may include unprocessed ore doré and unsold gold and silver all inventories as of july   and october   are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using a weighted average cost method metal inventory costs include direct labor materials depreciation as well as administrative overhead costs relating to mining activities   stockbased compensation fasb asc  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services but primarily focuses on transactions whereby an entity obtains employee services for sharebased payments fasb asc  requires that the compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments   the companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of fasb asc    the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement stockbased compensation related to nonemployees is accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services whichever is more readily determinable in accordance with fasb asc

communicated to the companys management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on this evaluation our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded as of july   that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to limited accounting and reporting personnel and a lack of segregation of duties due to limited financial resources and the size of our company  we will need to adopt additional disclosure controls and procedures prior to commencement of material operations consistent therewith on an ongoing basis we will evaluate the adequacy of our controls and procedures   a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that result in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected during the assessment for the nine months ended july   management identified the following material weaknesses      lack of segregation of duties  we have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures   lack of disclosure controls  there is a lack of disclosure controls to ensure adequate disclosures are made in our periodic filings   lack of continuity in key personnel  we have not maintained continuity in key personnel or have adequate staffing to ensure adequately efficient preparation of financial and operational statements   lack of inventory management control the company lacks sufficient personnel and financial resources to implement adequate handling tracking accounting and safeguarding of ore and finished goods inventory assets   management is committed to improving its internal controls and will continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the company with accounting and finance responsibilities  at this time however management has not established a time table for when it intends to address the aforementioned material weaknesses   b changes
