management however will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering if an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus to the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not immediately used for the above purposes we intend to invest our net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing bank deposits or debt instruments we face competition from a number of rewardbased crowdfunding platforms such as zdjcom and izhongchoutaobaocom many of these platforms are well established in the ecommerce market in china and have more resources and are better funded and better known than we are and also have a significant proprietary user base the top five largest rewardsplatforms in china zjdcom operated and owned by jdcom zhongchoucn hitaobaocom demohourcom and dreamorecom are reported to have raised an aggregate of rmb  million approximately  million which accounted for  of the total money raised in the rewardbased crowdfunding market in china we also face competition from other crowdfunding platforms that specialize in either loanbased equitybased or royaltybased crowdfunding offerings such as angelcruch angelclub and dajiaotou market leaders such as djjdcom an equity crowdfunding platform operated by jdcom utilizes a leadandfollow mechanism where institutional vc firms and angel funds will lead and manage the investment deals and allowing individual investors to participate on the same terms we believe that by offering business incubation services we attract high quality prospective projects with valuable services in addition to the funds that could be raised using our platform we market these services as well as the possibility that we may be able to introduce them to offline funding sources and potential business relationship through our formal and informal relationships we believe that because these additional services could assist the projects is developing their business we will be able to attract more quality projects we believe that we are one of the few platforms in the prc market that provides highquality business incubation services to entrepreneurs although we are aware that there are a number of incubation facilities including those with which we have a formal or informal relationship by providing these valueadded services we believe that projects on our platform could have a better chance of success in both product development and completing a fundraising campaign company description we operate a fast growing rewardbased crowdfunding platform in the prc and provide quality incubation services and financial services to entrepreneurs and business entities with funding needs utilizing our crowdfunding platform our revenue is generated from three sources • a percentage of the funds raised through our reward based crowdfunding platform which is generally  • fees resulting from our incubation services • finder’s fees paid to us for acting as a finder to projects for raising funds offline and for introductions to business partners acquisition candidates or other strategic relationships  our reward based crowdfunding platform crowdfunding is a process by which a project raises money from a large number of people primarily through an internetbased platform parties involved in crowdfunding are the platforms such as our platform the entrepreneurs or project sponsors and the participants or other funding sources who make a payment for the reward there are five basic types of crowdfunding programs — equity crowdfunding rewardbased crowdfunding debtbased crowdfunding royaltybased crowdfunding where the participants receive payments based on revenue generated by the project and donationbased crowdfunding currently we are only engaged in rewardbased crowdfunding in china we launched our online crowdfunding platform etou at wwwetoucn in march  we do not provide crowdfunding services in the united states or for projects in the united states all of the participants and projects are located in china our etou platform is designed to enable projects searching for funding to connect with funding sources our platform enables projects to access to initial seed money and to establish a track record in productservice development and operation history participants get involved in these projects for rewards often in the form of the product or service since the inception of the etou platform all of the successfully funded rewardbased projects have been able to fulfill andor deliver the promised rewards in the form of services or products for a rewardbased crowdfunding project the participant uses our platform to review opportunities and to consider whether he wants to make a payment to one or more of the projects that are then raising funds through our platform in exchange for his payment the participant receives a reward from the project if the project is developing a product the project can offer the finished product as reward which is in effect a preorder of the product this reward mechanism enables the project to use the presale proceeds to develop or manufacture the product the project may require certain amount of payment in order to receive the product and participants who pay a lesser amount may receive a lesser benefit such as a company tshirt or acknowledgement on the company’s website if the project is developing a service the project can offer a service or other benefit in each offering the project sets the offering amount the offering period and the nature of the offering including minimum contribution threshold to qualify the participant for a specified reward or benefit we have a participant base comprised of those potential participants who have registered to use our platform although it is not necessary for a participant to become a registered user in order to view available projects on our platform the participant must register before making any payment through our platform etou attracts unregistered users to view the information about projects seeking funding including information provided by the project sponsor as well as the number of users who expressed an interest in the project and who made investments in a specific project and the remaining time for a project to reach its target before its offering is terminated only registered users are able to make contributions to projects raising funding our registered users size has been increasing steadily from quarter to quarter since our inception  as of march   we had approximately  million registered users an increase of  million or  from december   an increase of  million or  from september   an increase of  million or  from march   from our inception to september   approximately  of registered users participated in at least one project and approximately  participated in at least two projects from our inception to march   approximately  of registered users participated in at least one project and approximately  participated in at least two projects from our inception to september   approximately  of registered users participated in at least one project and approximately  participated in at least two projects from our inception to march   approximately   of registered users participated in at least one project and approximately  participated in at least two projects we believe that increases in the number of registered users generally positively affect our revenue because such increase may provide more investors to participate in our crowdfunding projects and may provide us with more opportunities for monetization we require all rewardbased projects that successfully raise funds using our platform to provide us and contributors to such projects with key financial information update operation and product updates from time to time although we do not verify the accuracy or completeness of such information our incubation services in addition to the operation of our funding platforms we offer business incubation services to the projects utilizing our platform for their projects at the election of the projects on an ongoing or asneeded basis these services include business and operation advisory services relating to marketing sales strategic planning and guidance and general resources in ancillary services such as human resources legal accounting assisting with feasibility studies and other types of services that projects may need our services are not intended to substitute for professional services providers such as business operation professionals accountants or lawyers and will make referrals to thirdparty providers when needed we negotiate our fees for incubation services on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the specific services that our team provides the nature of the projects our business relationships with the project owners and whether the services are ongoing or asneeded clients utilizing our business incubation services are typically business and technology startups in the fields such as information technology media entertainment and tourism projects fundraising through our platform typically involve the development andor sales of products or services based upon a viable business proposition or prototypes still in development we provide quality business consulting and advisory services to our projects in each of their development stages from initiation to implementation and seek to assist those projects to reach profitability however we are not involved with the management of these projects and we cannot assure that the projects can or will ever operate profitably in the fiscal year ended march   we generated  through our business incubation services in the fiscal year ended march   we generated  through our business incubation services for our incubation services we have continued to allocate a significant part of our resources to fulfill the demand for incubation services as they arise our main strategy is to continue to grow our crowdfunding platform segment to increase the total number of projects successfully funded via our platform to date all of the projects receiving our business incubation services have previously raised capital via our crowdfunding platform although there is no guarantee that demand for our incubation services will consistently grow along with the increase in the number of our crowdfunding projects we believe our crowdfunding platform has played a critical role in providing us with incubation clients and in turn generating incubationservicerelated revenues we believe our business operation continues to root in providing crowdfunding platform service to various projects as we believe that our crowdfunding platform service segment is key to our business operation and revenue growth our financial services from time to time we also assist projects which have successfully funded their projects through our platform to seek additional equity or debt financing by introducing them to potential investors business partners merger candidates or other strategic relationships we charge a portion of the proceeds in the form of cash as a finder’s fee we negotiate the rate on a case by case basis and there is no guarantee that we would be able to secure a consistent rate in the future we generally only introduce projects to a limited number of funds or groups that are financially sophisticated in making risky investment unlike the united states where either issuer is not allowed to pay a finder’s fee or broker’s fee for raising funds from either a public or private issuer in the prc as long as the issuer is a not a public company and b the fundraising transaction does not involve any “public offering” of equity or debt securities pursuant to prc securities laws a finder is not required to obtain any special administrative approval for receiving finder’s fee or brokers fee for making business introductions or referrals and assisting fundraising in private financing transactions under prc securities laws “securities” refers to publiclyissued stock privatelyissued stock by a public company company bonds listed government bonds listed securities investment fund units securities derivatives and other securities identified by the state council of the prc pursuant to prc securities laws a nonpublic issuer conducting private financings of either equity or loan is a financing transaction that does not involve “an offer or
