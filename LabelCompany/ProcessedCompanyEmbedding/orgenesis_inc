terms of use disclaimer sitemap proprietary therapies proprietary therapies through our subsidiary orgenesis ltd orgenesis has developed a unique proprietary and patented platform technology called transdifferentiation or cell reprograming whereby an adult cell is converted into another type of cell with its distinct phenotype and function the first indication for the companys unique cellbased therapy was development of autologous insulin producing aip cells that transforms the patients own liver cell into a fully functional and physiologically glucoseresponsive insulinproducing cell designed to provide longterm insulin independence orgenesis has utilized its proprietary technology to successfully reprogram human liver cells into glucoseresponsive fully functional insulin producing cells converting the diabetic patients own tissue into insulinproducing cells has the potential to provide a practical cure for insulin dependent diabetes and overcome the significant issues of donor shortage cost and exposure to chronic immunosuppressive therapy associated with islet cell transplantation because the aip cells are autologous this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy stem cells vs adult cells within the field of cell therapy research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded all living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates differentiates matures and perpetuates in an adult organism throughout its lifetime stem cells in either embryonic or adult forms are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells such as white blood cells nerve cells or heart muscle cells our cell therapy development efforts do not use stem cells but rather offer a much more targeted approach using fully mature adult cells for our purposes in the treatment of diabetes our cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are transdifferentiated to become adult aip cells our technology utilizing adult cells is designed to reduce the risk of cell mutation and allows for the testing of cells ex vivo before insertion secondly our adult cells do not propagate inside the patient eliminating the risk of malignancy lastly our technology utilizes the patients own autologous cells which eliminates the risk of an immune response or rejection and no pouch or encapsulation device is required to isolate the cells from the patients immune system orgs
