great stories like this click on one of these buttons already a subscriber see if you like it get it all premium access photo by byron small bill battle walked past the sprawling live oaks between the stately twostory columns and into the university of alabama’s rose administration building looking for answers this was the fall of  long before battle wore that distinguished head of white hair and was known as the southern gentleman whose company built the  billion collegiate licensing industry back then in fact battle was known as a former football player for bear bryant at alabama and a fired football coach at tennessee who shocked his peers by walking away from the game to run a window company in selma ala his wins came in the form of deals like the  million project to install thermal windows in a saudi arabian building collegiate licensing such a concept was so foreign in  that battle couldn’t find anyone at the university of alabama who knew what licensing was battle himself wasn’t sure “i must have gone to six or seven offices that day asking where the licensing department was” battle said “they said ‘licensing for what’ nobody knew what i was talking about” battle’s concept for a collegiate licensing business became the basis for a company that redefined what it meant to make hats tshirts and other items with college marks he didn’t just build a company he forged an industry that has become an important revenue source for athletic departments across the country and made the licensing of marks easier for manufacturers battle’s collegiate licensing co eventually represented more than  schools bowl games conferences and other college entities creating a valuable revenue stream while cleaning up a rogue business that turned out unsavory products like condoms and beer with unofficial school marks for larger schools like alabama licensing now brings in  million to  million annually more in years when the crimson tide wins championships all from the model that battle put in place with clc he sold the company to img in  for more than  million but  years ago battle’s vision of consolidating school licensing rights into a model that resembled the nfl’s had not even come into focus he certainly had no idea how the events of the next year would not only change his life but also give shape to a fledgling industry no on this day he just wanted to find someone at alabama who had a clue what he was talking about starts with the bear every quarter battle delivered the financial report for the decatur iron and steel co — otherwise known as disco — to the board of directors at its selma headquarters but on a particular january day in  battle the company’s president couldn’t stay focused all he could think about was his old coach bear bryant bryant was a mostly ceremonial member of disco’s board and he attended to most everyone’s surprise just about all of the board meetings battle who played for the legendary coach  years earlier made it his routine to drive over to the selma holiday inn pick up bryant and take him to the office for the board meetings during the drive on this chilly morning though bryant nonchalantly dropped some news on his former player that would forever alter the course of battle’s life bill battle’s early college contacts came from his days as an alabama football player the old coach in the houndstooth hat had decided that he no longer would be represented by img “he said those guys up in new york just weren’t doing anything for him” battle said “shoot i didn’t even know that he had an agent” as a distracted battle delivered his quarterly report he kept thinking about how he could represent bryant who was nine victories away from breaking the alltime wins record “i couldn’t get it out of my mind” battle said “to me he was the most wellknown coach in the country the greatest figure in college athletics all i could think about was ‘holy cow he’s about to change agents’” so after the meeting battle steadied himself and said “coach i don’t know that much about licensing and i don’t know that much about being an agent but i know you and i’ll make sure we do it the way you want to do it” “in that old gravely voice coach bryant said ‘aw i ain’t got nothing to sell the best in the business has been trying to sell me for years all i want is somebody to take all these requests for speaking engagements and tell them i can’t come’” battle tells the story with a raucous laugh that just about busts a gut the most famous and revered coach in college football was going to be represented by the president of a window company as bryant neared the wins record the following season requests began to flow in for licensing rights to the bear’s image and likeness manufacturers wanted to make hats tshirts — anything they could produce that had bryant’s likeness on it one company made bronzecolored busts of the bear one of which sits in the clc offices in atlanta today what golden bear taught battle about the licensing business bill battle freely admits he didn’t know much about licensing in  when he began representing bear bryant and in the same year became the licensing agent for the university of alabama deals that led to the formation of the collegiate licensing co so how did he learn during that time battle was president of a window company in selma ala owned by larry striplin he had known striplin for years and went to work for him after being fired as tennessee’s head football coach in  one of striplin’s other businesses was golden eagle enterprises which made otey crisman hickoryshafted putters and eyewear with jack nicklaus’ golden bear logo striplin had purchased both the putter and eyewear companies and merged them into something that could only loosely be called a sports marketing business battle still laughs out loud when he reminisces about “our little putter and eyewear company” “we were losing our rear end” he said striplin invited battle to tag along on a  visit to nicklaus’ golden bear headquarters in florida to discuss the licensed eyewear business they were there to meet with nicklaus’ trusted adviser chuck perry battle like a lot of college licensees years later didn’t understand why golden eagle paid the golden bear so much money for a logo on a pair of sunglasses eddie dobbs who ran the golden eagle business for striplin explained it to battle this way “look consumers don’t have the first clue who we are but they understand jack nicklaus and the golden bear” “one of the things i learned” battle said “is that jack nicklaus’ heirs will be making lots of money from the golden bear long after jack is gone so that’s how i learned about licensing “when the opportunity to represent coach bryant came along i thought that we could do for him what the golden bear did for jack nicklaus” when battle won the right to represent bryant and the university of alabama in licensing matters in  those rights were rolled into golden eagle three years later armed with the rights to more than a dozen schools battle bought golden eagle from striplin moved it to atlanta and renamed it the collegiate licensing co striplin who died at age  in january remains one of battle’s inspirations even though he was about as opposite as you can get from battle striplin wasn’t afraid to take a chance on anything while the financially conservative battle “really hates to borrow money” said rod knowles his banker for  years but it was striplin’s entrepreneurial spirit that fed battle’s own pioneering desire to consolidate the fragmented collegiate licensing world “not bad for a little putter and eyewear company” battle laughs with a sense of satisfaction — michael smith “things picked up dramatically” battle said “that’s when it got fun and what happened as more people wanted the license for coach bryant they wanted to use alabama’s logos too” finding the gatekeeper for alabama’s marks however presented a problem the crimson tide like most schools  years ago didn’t have a licensing program finally after walking the halls and fruitlessly knocking on doors inside the rose administration building that day on the tuscaloosa campus battle came across a familiar face in the school’s purchasing office battle had known finus gaston because of their mutual connection to alabama football — battle as a player for bryant’s first national championship team in  and gaston as a team manager years later gaston’s father also had been the sports information director at alabama when battle was a player maybe gaston would know the answer to battle’s licensing question what battle didn’t know when he entered the office is that gaston had been talking to other administrators on sec campuses about just such a program they just weren’t sure how to get it going how could these colleges sell licenses manage the licensees make sure they get paid and enforce the program against rogue tshirt makers who were pumping product out of their basements in walked bill battle “as soon as we started talking about a licensing program we knew there was a lot of synergy there with coach bryant and alabama” said gaston now the athletic department’s chief financial officer “the more we talked the more sense it made it was just logical for everything to come together right there” that conversation late in  set the table for alabama to become battle’s first collegiate client in what was then golden eagle enterprises the company that became clc in  golden eagle a company that made hickoryshafted mallet putters and jack nicklauslicensed eyewear was owned by the same man larry striplin who owned disco — and it had just enough of a licensing flavor to serve as the agency for that college business that battle was starting to bring in think it was strange for a window company president to serve as bear bryant’s agent how about a putter and eyewear company representing the university of alabama’s licensing but this is how it all started “after we talked for a while bill said he wanted to submit a licensing proposal to the university” gaston said “we just didn’t know who you’d submit it to” after battle secured alabama with approval from the school’s president mississippi soon jumped on board within a few years seven of the acc’s eight schools at the time became clients too wake forest was one of those first acc clients ben sutton now img college’s president was the deacons’ licensing director in the s “bill used to say that ‘we’ve got everybody from alabama to wake forest’” sutton said “i took it to mean alphabetical … bill blazed the path onto campus for a lot of businesses we all owe him a great debt for that” a business ally battle’s path into the acc was cleared by clemson’s athletic director at the time bill mclellan who proved to be an important ally the tigers won the national football championship in  and products with tiger paws started showing up everywhere in the following months clemson couldn’t regulate it mclellan had seen one of battle’s licensing proposals similar to what he had sent to alabama and arranged for battle to meet with all of the acc’s athletic directors which led to discussions with the schools’ business chiefs battle liked to pitch to the vice presidents in charge of business because they typically oversaw the bookstores with mclellan opening the door battle signed nearly all of the conference’s schools virginia was the lone acc school that didn’t sign — a notable exception because a rival was beginning to emerge steve crossland a former bookstore manager at the university of southern california was attempting to corral some schools of his own and virginia represented a big early win battle and crossland eventually decided to join forces and when they did clc’s list of schools grew to  crossland remained a partner until battle bought him out in  battle oversaw the growth of the college licensing business from tshirts and hats to such diverse products as perfume keyboards billiard balls hair dryers and tires photos by brian small products img through the developing years battle made college administrators see that there was strength and efficiency in numbers and his efforts to aggregate collegiate rights was on its way the schools the licensees and the retailers all could win if they were in this together battle said sure they’d have to pay royalties but with the top schools finally available from the same licensing agent licensees could go one place to acquire  or  licenses and eventually the overall pie would grow so much faster the schools liked the enforcement that came with it too administrators used to throw up their hands every time they saw unlicensed products that didn’t reflect well on the school thinking they couldn’t do anything about it battlin’ bulldog beer was one of those products the cans featured a hungover georgia bulldog in a school sweater with bloodshot eyes the school took the beer’s distributor bill laite of macon ga to court in  to make him stop marketing the beer cans with the unlicensed bulldog mascot clc also developed the first label that identified “officially licensed collegiate products” despite some of those wins not everyone was on board many administrators doubted that there was any money in licensing arkansas ad frank broyles had to be convinced that the school even owned the rights to its own marks university bookstores the only place consumers could find school merchandise back then weren’t in favor of the new model either they already had the market cornered bookstores bought from whichever manufacturers they wanted and royalties weren’t being paid battle had to convince them that his model would make them more money eventually “one of the smartest things we did was put incentives for the schools in the contracts” battle said “once i saw that we could get the schools to sign i wasn’t worried about making enough money i was worried about making too much i didn’t want anyone on campus asking why they were paying us all that money so we put incentives in there that paid the school even more as sales went up the more we got the more they got” before battle consolidated the college market it was extremely fragmented requiring a licensee to go from school to school to buy the rights battle had to sell administrators on his vision of a model that resembled the nfl’s where all of the marks were available in one place along the way clc broadened its business to represent nascar — battle actually started nascar’s licensing business — and the pga tour but it never strayed from its college roots “you just couldn’t conceive of someone better suited to start clc than bill” said russ richards battle’s attorney for the last  years “he’s this tall handsome guy with this disarming personality who just sets everyone at ease he had been an athlete and a coach and he knew how the college administrators thought “this is the guy who is the smartest guy in the room but he never acts like he’s the smartest guy in the room” over the years schools saw battle as less of an old coach and more of a business ally who understood the challenges on campus and could respond with a serviceoriented approach that’s why athletic directors still call him whether they have a question about business or they’re looking to hire a position he remains one of the most quietly influential figures in college athletics today even though he has slipped away from the daytoday duties of running the company working as clc’s chairman and an adviser for the company’s management battle  remains that important figure because of his deep relationships with clients and his ties to clc’s past his sons pat and mike and daughter shannon worked in the business through the years and pat became an influential figure in the sale of clc to img he led the growth of img college from  to  when he left the company consolidating the college marketplace from a marketing and sponsorship standpoint was pat’s ultimate goal at img college but he took his cue from his dad he said more than  years ago bill battle saw how the fragmented college marketplace could be brought together and clc came as close to doing it as anyone could “the original vision for all of this was my dad’s” pat battle said “he saw that it could be done” ‘doing the right thing’ the halls inside clc’s atlanta office today are a testament to battle’s vision boots with oklahoma state marks a red georgia tool box and a ucla no  foam finger are among the hundreds of licensed products that line the walls as long as battle is in town and not visiting one of his vacation homes or his favorite retreat a severalhundredacre farm northeast of atlanta he’s in the office taking calls from longtime associates like alabama ad mal moore or serving as a resource to img college’s sutton who oversees clc’s business now mostly though battle enjoys the spoils of what he’s built he’d just as soon be outside hunting turkeys or dropping a line the water top battle with nacda’s bob vecchione left son and thenclc executive pat battle second from right and espn’s rob temple mark clc’s th anniversary in  above the national football foundation honored battle t boone pickens center and john glenn at its awards dinner in  photos by collegiate licensing co gene boyers  national football foundation then there are days like the one a few weeks ago when barry white called and wanted to go to lunch white was fresh out of college from the university of alabamabirmingham when he called battle and asked for a job in the early s white who would become the first nonfamily employee at clc grew up a huge crimson tide fan and he knew battle’s story as a former player for bear bryant and the youngest coach in the country when he took the tennessee job at  “honestly i couldn’t believe it when bill battle called me back” white said “my parents couldn’t believe it i knew he had this little sports marketing company down in selma and to me working for him was my dream job” white had been onboard just a year or so and was still green to the licensing business when battle shocked him with an assignment to go pitch tennessee for its licensing business white guessed at the time that battle didn’t want to go because of how the volunteers treated the former coach when he was there even though battle took the vols to a bowl game in each of his first five seasons he was fired in year seven and throughout his tenure the local fans never warmed to him one day battle pulled up to his house in knoxville to find a moving van sitting there other times fans would come by in the middle of the night and express their displeasure by putting “for sale” signs in his front yard battle was an alabama guy and even his  record with the vols wasn’t enough to satisfy the big orange faithful when white returned from making his pitch to tennessee administrators battle commended him for a job well done it was later white found out that battle already had secured the business he just sent white for a confidencebuilding experience battle hired a lot of recent college graduates at clc just like white because he liked their enthusiasm and energy that day over lunch white now a highranking marketing executive with chickfila in atlanta repeated to battle something he’s said a hundred times “bill i can’t believe you gave me a chance” white told him “he gave a young guy a chance and i’ll forever be appreciative of that and the thing is that he’s done that for a lot of people” cory moss a senior vice president at clc and a veteran of nearly  years at the company runs the daytoday business now he’s one of those many young people who dreamed of a profession in sports and started at clc moss can recall two occasions that he’s been in the hospital during that span and battle was the first nonfamily member to visit each time including once when moss’ wife had triplets only to lose two of them from complications of a premature birth “bill was right there for us” moss said “he is the consummate leader by example … the one thing he always talks about is doing the right thing for the client even if it might not be the best financial decision for the company he believes that if you do the right thing for the client the program will grow” just look at battle’s associations through the years and you’ll understand why so many people call him the southern gentleman of the college business his banker rod knowles has been his friend and adviser for  years richards his attorney has worked with battle for some  years he still goes bird hunting with his college roommate and crimson tide teammate butch wilson and he still goes to visit alabama’s moore who played with battle on that  national championship team to talk about the good old days nobody it seems just does business with battle they form relationships and more times than not those relationships last a lifetime “bill has backed an untold number of people” knowles said “he probably wouldn’t want me to tell this but he has given support to so many people who have fallen on hard times just because he believed in them or wanted to help them” clc is the perfect reflection of battle img has owned the company for five years now but a trip around the clc home office near the chattahoochee river in atlanta reveals just one small img logo clc has maintained its name and an identity separate from parent company img because of all the personal equity battle built into it over the last  years “there’s just a great reverence for coach battle and for clc” sutton said “a lot of people thought that bill probably would have moved on after img bought the company but i’ve pleaded for him to stay and remain engaged he’s a great visionary a great entrepreneur and he’s been a role model for somebody like me he has an amount of good will of social capital that’s really unmatched the way i hear schools talk about clc and bill battle that’s how i want them to talk about img college” battle recalls thrills of competition from both football and business bill battle’s ability to recall details is legendary among his friends the way old coaches remember an otherwise obscure yard run from a game  years ago battle  remembers details about meetings and chance encounters that played integral roles in the development of the collegiate licensing co here are a few of the stories he shared from his days playing for bear bryant at alabama through coaching at tennessee and finally building clc into a national licensing powerhouse ■ battle’s tennessee team squared off against joe paterno’s penn state squad during the  and ’ seasons with both games played in knoxville in the  game tennessee pulled out a hardfought win  and at the midfield handshake paterno asked battle if he could speak to the team in the volunteers’ locker room paterno came over and told the vols that they played the game the way it ought to be played and offered his congratulations on the win then he added “but the real reason i’m here is that i told all my friends back in state college that i wasn’t leaving knoxville without being in the winning team’s locker room i just didn’t think i was going to have to do it this way” battle said he came to appreciate paterno after playing him and beating him both times “joe had that bronx accent and i thought he talked too much” battle said with a laugh “but after we played them i became a big joe paterno fan i was saddened tremendously by the way he went out” ■ the a club for lettermen at alabama was one of the most prestigious clubs on campus when battle was in school there in the late s and early ’s and back in the day initiation into the a club came with some pretty severe hazing including a shaved head one player joe namath decided that he didn’t care to endure the hazing and passed on an invitation to join the a club alabama’s coach bear bryant himself a former alabama athlete and a club member heard about this and called namath into a private meeting battle led the program at tennessee from  to ‘ as one of the youngest college coaches in the country photos courtesy of bill battle “i don’t know what happened in that meeting but when joe came out all of the sudden he wanted to go through initiation for a club” said battle who was president of the club his senior year ■ one of battle’s best friends in sports business is jim host while battle was building his collegiate licensing business host was building his own multimedia rights business but the models were drastically different clc paid a royalty to a school after a sale had been made which worked for battle’s conservative financial philosophy host on the other hand paid out millions in guarantees to his college clients and then sold the advertising and sponsorship to make his money back even though that model made battle nervous he had several conversations about partnering with host and merging their companies “jim is a much bigger risk taker than i am” battle said “i don’t do well with that i love jim he’s one of my favorite people and i’ve learned a lot from him we talked about trading stock or getting together i was willing to seriously entertain it so we went through the exercise we opened our books and our numbers were pretty straightforward their numbers kept moving they were based more on ‘what we’re going to do’ i don’t want to know what you’re going to do what are you doing right now i got a little nervous i didn’t see where we needed to be together” ■ on the decision to sell clc to img in  for more than  million battle said “i would have been happy either way i was happy to leave it the way it was hoping my grandchildren would get in the business someday but if you’re going to sell the time we sold was about as good a time as you could want” — michael smith return to top related topics champions street  smithssportsbusiness dailyglobal advertise with uscompany historycontact uscollege and university programeditorial

young heroes to stop the coming inferno — if he can get them to stop fighting each other and start fighting as a team before the world is reduced to cinders advertising editorial reviews from the

dale brown returns to the world stage in battle born picking up loose ends from his  technothriller fatal terrain that novel began as china launched a smallscale nuclear assault on taiwan after it declared full independence and sovereignty at the same time a nuclear explosion in yokosuka harbor outside tokyo destroyed several american warships including the aircraft carrier uss independence although the chinese were suspected the actual culprit was never positively identified when the united states tried to halt the prcs attacks against taiwan the chinese retaliated by launching a nuclear attack against us military bases on guam a stunned us struck back effectively destroying both chinas air force and its last remaining icbms but afterward chose not to escalate the conflict two years later the us is keeping a wary eye on the chinese and trying to mend fences with nervous allies japan for example fearful of chinese aggression has closed down all us military bases little does anyone know that another wild card is about to be played this time by south korea a joint usjapanesesouth korean military exercise goes horribly awry when south korean pilots race across the dmz to support a massive peoples revolt against the communists to everyones surprise the bold initiative succeeds armed with weapons the chinese provided to the north the newly minted united korea becomes the worlds newest nuclear power ironically its most likely target is china who many fear will launch a preemptive strike on the fledgling nation seeking to contain the situation a shaken us president turns to generals terrill samson and patrick mclanahan backed by technological marvels developed at groom lake a topsecret military facility and supported by a feisty group of fliers appropriated from the nevada air national guard battle born is nevadas state motto mclanahan once again enters the fray this time trying desperately to avert the beginning of world war iii the odds are against him but this doesnt phase mclanahan a bit  hes made a career out of bucking the odds obviously pitched toward technothriller fans tom clancy fans will feel right at home here battle born will satisfy general readers as well for those who crave a charismatic hero it stars browns longrunning series character patrick mclanahan for political junkies it brims with domestic and international intrigue theres hardware aplenty for techno geeks air battles for avionics buffs and plenty of thrills for action fans the book also has a serious side although brown could have better depicted the human cost of the carnage basically all we get are numbers he does a great job of casting light on the current global situation mclanahans volatile world differs from our own but not by much the korean situation he depicts is especially plausible  the conditions described in battle born are eerily close to those that exist in those troubled countries today hopefully should events develop in our reality as they do in battle born soldiers like patrick mclanahan will step forward to save the day hank wagner publishers weekly  publishers weekly last spotted on a singlehanded crusade against international terrorism in the tin man veteran hero patrick mclanahan now a onestar general is back at the head of a us air force team in this th military technothriller from the everpopular brown the generals

to take out seoul with nuclear weapons this leads to the second korean war as american flyers help their south korean allies conquer a seriously weakened enemy but a new united korea is soon threatening china and only mclanahans team flying megafortress bombers equipped with sophisticated antiballistic missiles can prevent nuclear conflict sidestepping obstructive air force bureaucracy and quelling the feuds smoldering among his pilots mclanahan takes on the role of a renegade elder statesman in his latest foray leaving most of the flying to his nevada team headed by rinc rodeo seaver and rincs clandestine lover and commanding officer rebecca furness seaver accused of causing the deaths of three officers in a training maneuver has a lot to prove and it is his story that drives the personal subplot browns strongest suit however has always been his ability to generate tension through highwire aeronautics and technological breakthroughs and in this tale he flourishes an ace top secret plasmayield warheads subatomic weapons that silently vaporize their targets his dialogue is as stilted as ever and the acronym count as high but browns poetry lies in his exhaustive

question again in my lifetime the chairman of the senate armed services committee said his voice serious but here it is looks like the devils goin to the prom and were praying he dont ask us to dancethe main part of the mornings classified closed hearing had already concluded the scientists and comptrollers had packed up their charts and spreadsheets leaving only the subcommittee members several general officers and a few aides this was the open debate portion of the session a chat session where everything was fair game and the uniformed officers had a last chance to persuade it was usually more casual and more freewheeling than formal subcommittee testimony and it gave all involved a chance to vent their frustrations and opinionsid say senator air force general victor g hayes the chief of staff of the air force responded that weve got no choice but to dance with that devil the question is can we keep him from only tipping over the punch bowl or is he going to burn down the whole school gymnasium if we dont do somethingyou characterize the attacks on taiwan and guam as just a tippedover punch bowl general a committee member askedgeneral hayes shook his head and wiped the smile from his face he knew better than to try to get too chummy or casual with these committee members no matter how plaintalking and downhome they sometimes soundedthis was the first time victor jester hayes had testified before any committee in congress although the pentagon gave charm school classes and seminars to highranking officers on how to handle reporters dignitaries and civilians in a variety of circumstances including giving testimony before congress it was simply impossible to fully prepare for ordeals like this he did not feel comfortable here and he was afraid it showed bigtimethe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff navy admiral george balboa was seated beside hayes the other members of the joint chiefs  general william marshall army chief of staff admiral wayne connor chief of naval operations and general peter traherne commandant of the marine corps along with senior deputies and aides  were also seated at the table facing the subcommittee out of the corner of his eye hayes could see the barely disguised amusement on some of their faces balboa in particular seemed to be enjoying the sight of hayes roasting a little in front of a congressional subcommitteescrew em all hayes told himself resolutely im a fighter pilot im an aerial assassin these congressmen may be highranking elected government officials but they wouldnt understand a good fight if it kicked them in the ass be yourself show em what you got as far as balboa was concerned  well he was a weasel and everyone knew it he was virtually powerless allowed to keep his position by the good graces of powerful opposition party members in congress even though he publicly ambushed his commander in chiefforgive me for trying to take some of the doomsday tone out of this discussion senator hayes responded after two days of secret testimony on some of the new black weapons programs weve included in the air force budget i thought it might be time for a little break but i assure you this is a very serious matter the future of the united states air force and indeed the fate of our military forces and the nation itself will be determined in the next several years by the decisions we make todayi characterize the ballistic missile attacks on taiwan and guam by the peoples republic of china as a repudiation of thirty years of arms reduction efforts and a warning to the united states armed forces that we must develop a multilayered antimissile defense system immediately we bargained away our antimissile capabilities in the s believing that nonproliferation would lead to peace now in the face of renewed aggression rearmament terrorism and the spread of smallscale and blackmarket weapons of mass destruction i feel we have no choice but to rebuild our defensive forces the days of believing that our conventional precision warfighting capability obviated and obsoleted decades of nuclear warfare strategy and technology are historyapparently so one committee member said ruefully i for one am mystified and angry about this waste of time money and resources weve spent hundreds of billions of dollars on these new smart weapons and now youre saying they wont protect usim saying that the rules are changing senator general hayes said earnestly and we must change with themwe gave away our defensive capability because we kept a large strong offensive force including nuclear deterrent forces we then dismantled those deterrent forces when the threat from other superpowers diminished now the threat is back but we have neither defensive nor deterrent forces in place that leaves us vulnerable to criticism at best and attack at worst the china incident is a perfect examplethats all fine and good general but these budget numbers are staggering and the path you want to embark on here reminds me of the nuclear nightmare times of eisenhower kennedy and reagan the senator went on motioning to his staff report youre asking for billions more on some truly horrifying programs like antiballistic missile lasers spacebased lasers and these socalled plasmayield weapons whats going on general is the air force so desperate for a mission right now that youll even go back to mutually assured destruction doctrines of the cold warmembers of the committee i asked secretary of defense chastain and secretary of the air force mortonson to give the air force a budget for the deployment of a new class of weapons not to shock or galvanize the congress but because i truly believe the time has long passed for us to be thinking about this kind of war fighting general hayes went on chinas recent nuclear attacks on taiwan its suspected nuclear sabotage of the aircraft carrier uss independence in yokosuka harbor and its shocking unprovoked and horrific ballistic missile nuclear attack on the island of guam which all but wiped anderson air force base off the map three years ago all are a warning to the united statesits a warning all right another senator offered but it seems more a warning to avoid stepping up to the edge of that slippery slope do we want to start another nuclear arms raceit seemed as if most folks in america had all but forgotten what had happened only three years ago hayes thought grimly in  just before their reunification day celebrations the peoples republic of china launched a smallscale nuclear assault on taiwan which had just declared full independence and sovereignty from the mainland several taiwanese military bases were decimated over fifty thousand persons lost their lives at the same time a nuclear explosion in yokosuka harbor outside tokyo destroyed several american warships including the soontoberetired aircraft carrier uss independence china was accused of that unconscionable act but the actual culprit was never positively identified when the united states tried to halt the prcs attacks against taiwan china retaliated by launching a nuclear ballistic missile attack on the island of guam shutting down two important american military bases in the pacificthe reverberations of that fateful summer of  were still being felt japan had closed down all us military bases on their soil and had only recently begun allowing some limited access to us warships  provisioning and humanitarian shore leave only with ships at anchor in the harbor not in port and no weapons transfers in their territorial waters south korea was permitting only routine provisioning and shore leave  they were allowing no weapons transfers within five miles of shore and prohibited staging military operations from their ports it was the same for most ports of call in the western pacific american naval presence in the pacific was almost niland americas response to chinas attacks was  silence except for one massive joint air forcenavy defensive air armada around taiwan that all but destroyed chinas air force and an isolated but highly effective series of air raids inside china  largely attributed to american stealth bombers aided by taiwanese fighters  the americans had not retaliated it was world condemnation alone that eventually forced china to abandon its plan to force taiwan back into its sphere of influenceim concerned about the path russia japan and north korea are taking in the wake of the economic collapse in asia and the conflict in the balkans hayes went on russia appears to be back in the hands of hardliners and neocommunists food riots in north korea have led to the slaughter of thousands of civilians by military forces foraging for food japan has isolated us out of the pacific and is proceeding with plans to remilitarize all in an apparent attempt to shore up confidence in its government i dont believe the united states sparked this return to the specter of the cold war but we must be prepared to deal with itwe are all shocked and horrified about all those events as well general the senator pointed out and we agree with the president that we must be better prepared for radical changes in the political climate but this  this buildup of such powerful weapons that youre asking for seems to be an overreaction what you are proposing goes far beyond what any of us see as a measured response to world eventsgeneral hayes swallowed hard this was turning into a much harder sell than he had expected while the world slowly went back to an uneasy suspicious peace president kevin martindale was roundly criticized for his inaction although china was stopped and an allout nuclear conflict was averted many americans wanted someone to pay a bigger price for the hundreds of thousands who had died on taiwan guam and onboard the four navy warships destroyed in yokosuka harbor the hawkish president was slammed in the press for abandoning the capital onboard air force one during the attacks on taiwan while failing to use most of the military power he had spent his entire career in washington trying to build upno one could say precisely what martindale should have done but everyone was convinced he should have done something more show more what people are saying about this clive cussler the best military adventure writer in the country today meet

sure as shinola hope so guest more than  year ago this book is really good read for anyone that likes the air force and enjoys a good war novel guest more than  year ago after writing a whole bunch of great air warfare books it seemed like mr brown was in cruise control in battle born wait for the paperback guest more than  year ago i just finished reading battle born and to tell you the truth it was a waste of time dale brown goes into so much detail about who what and when do we really need to know how many people are in a room their names families bad habits etc this book is almost  pages and there is only about  to  pages out of the whole book related to the actual battle born nevade guard unit in action otherwise just boring details geeesh i have always loved dale browns work and have read them cover to cover with great excitement i had to force myself to read this book hoping with each page that it would get better dale brown always likes to associate himself with tom clancy tom clancy has not written a good book by himself in years dale i guess is now so succesful that he can turn out any junk and put his name on it and it sells i was really burned and very very very disappointed hopefully dale will go back to his roots and start writing about flying and the excitement of that what a waste of  guest more than  year ago i have every book that brown has written its good to see that he is going back into the military aspect in his novels this book dragged though too much preparation for action and not enough action that was kind of dissapointing but the book is written masterfully and i would recommend it to anyone battle of britain by patrick bishop paperback  barnes  noble® up to  off with code savemore    off the criterion collection   favorite paperbacks
