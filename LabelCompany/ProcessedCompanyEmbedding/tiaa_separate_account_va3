sounds like a onesizefitsall investment solution tailormade for the average investor but is this annuity really a good fit for you annuities are longterm investments and variable annuities in particular can be expensive to own the tiaacref has made an admirable effort to eliminate as many of these fees as possible but at the end of the day it’s still a variable annuity variable annuities

particular annuity is in your best interest who are we annuity gator is made of a group of independent financial professionals dedicated to helping the average person decode the frantic claims made by annuity salespersons and companies claims that work hard to grab your attention such as highest payouts lowest fees top rated guaranteed income for the rest of your life  returns with no risk to your principal any of this sound familiar ever wonder if these are too good to be true it’s not that the claims they make are outright lies but rather that these features and benefits may not be explained fully so most people don’t really understand what they are getting into for example that  to  return with no risk to your principal isn’t on money that you can actually withdraw as a lump sum furthermore in order to get that guarantee you have to purchase an addon feature which will change the way the returns are actually calculated annuities can get complicated and sometimes even advisors

you so you can focus on getting what you want in the most efficient way possible making each dollar count to meet your investment goals let’s get started tiaacref intelligent variable annuity at a glance product name tiaacref intelligent variable annuity issuer tiaacref teachers insurance and annuity association college retirement equities fund standard  poor’s ratingaaa exceptionally strong phone number  websitewwwtiaaorg opening thoughts on the tiaacref intelligent variable annuity one notable difference about this variable annuity is its noble origins in  the carnegie foundation formed the teachers insurance and annuity association tiaa with the specific purpose of offering a retirement plan and pension system for professors they followed a longterm approach to investing that fortified the company against the great depression when the average rate of inflation jumped to  in  and people started living longer however the tiaa decided it was time to get into the stock market in  they created the college retirement equities fund cref which was in effect the country’s very first variable annuity with such historic beginnings it makes sense that the tiaacref has had time to perfect their product and as a company they have a rocksolid rating your annuity is only as strong as the claimspaying ability of the issuing company and you can’t get better than an aaa rating another notable feature offered by the tiaacref intelligent variable is the promise of low fees and no surrender charges both of which are rare offerings inside a variable annuity product let’s take a look at these claims closely in terms of the promises made by this annuity to grow your money and to structuring your money for income growing your money before you retire your focus is on accumulation if you are an investor who is considering this variable annuity with the goal of accumulation the tiaacref offers about  choices from  different investment management firms which is low compared to other variable annuities out there you will be charged a fair management fee for each fund that you choose in addition to the other fees charged by the insurance company we will explore these fees at length in a later section but for now you want to ask yourself if your goal is to grow your money then why would you have it in a vehicle where you also have to pay fees to an insurance company on another note a closer examination of the prospectus reveals tiers of investment options only available as a separate account va which and we quote here from the prospectus “provides variable annuities for employees of colleges universities other educational and research organizations and other governmental and nonprofit institutions” if your employer does not offer the tiaacref as an investment option and you are working with a thirdparty financial advisor who is selling you this product then be aware that he or she may deduct a fee from your annuity for the privilege of accessing these funds structuring money for income the insurance company is there to provide the guaranteed income side of the equation when the time comes here is where things start to get complicated because the features and benefits of the product start to change before you start the income payments you have the option to exit the contract without surrender charges although if you are under the age of  ½ you may be assessed other penalties however you cannot get income guarantees or the guaranteed rates of return associated with those options until your elect an annuity income option without the annuity income option your income payments and minimum income amount are not guaranteed you can access your money but you can also lose your money for example if you want to take out a portion of your money for income or to make a down payment on a condo you can take your money out of the annuity without being assessed a surrender charge by tiaacref like any mutual fund in the stock market however the value of your intelligent variable annuity could be up or it could be down we call withdrawing money from a fluctuating account “reverse dollar cost averaging” because you risk losing the compounding ability of your investment when this happens at or near retirement you risk running out of money which is why you don’t want to take out the retirement income you are depending on from investments that may go up and down in value as you near or enter retirement most people are looking for guarantees how does the tiaacref compare to other annuities in terms of these guarantees overall i’d say the guarantees they offer lock you in and give you less opportunity for growth as compared to other annuities on the market today the fixed indexed annuity for example can give you the same income guarantees with more flexibility and access to your money and for the same low fees furthermore the tiaacref variable annuity gives you no potential for capturing the upside potential of the market while getting downside protection you can get this with other annuity products such as the fia on the market there’s more to dig into here on the income side of things but first here are some legal disclosures… this is an independent product review not a recommendation to buy or sell an annuity tiaacref has not endorsed this review in any way nor do we receive any compensation for this review this review is meant to be an independent review at the request of readers so they could see our perspective when breaking down the positives and negatives of this particular model annuity before purchasing any investment product be sure to do your own due diligence and consult a properly licensed professional should you have specific questions as they relate to your individual circumstances all names marks and materials used for this review are the property of their respective owners how tiaacref describes the intelligent variable annuity tiaacref describes the benefits and features of this annuity on their website as follows a lowcost retirement solution potential for growth that can outpace inflation taxdeferred earnings a benefit all annuities provide investment options with unlimited contribution limits no surrender charges a variety of distribution options including lifetime income their biggest claimtofame is their low fees but this list here covers a few other highlights if you want to find the website andor prospectus you can click here how financial advisors might present this annuity to you tiaacref sounds like an organization with its heart in the right place with their mission of serving people who have given their lives to the service to others as a company that originally structured pensions for teachers you would expect this variable annuity to deliver their feelgood marketing materials make a lot of claims that while true individually may not all come together to paint the rosy picture you might be led to believe here are the three main concepts you may hear sales professionals use when explaining this particular variable annuity followed by a translation so you can understand what that means to you this investment can grow your money faster because the funds accumulate taxdeferred lower fees also mean greater accumulation as compared to other annuities you have the option to receive fixed income payments for as long as you andor your spouse live or you can receive payments for a fixed period of time first let’s take a look at growth all annuities regardless of whether they are a variable or fixed are able to grow your money tax deferred this means that you pay the taxes on the qualified money you put into the investment only when you take it out this is how traditional iras and ks are designed – to help encourage investors to save if you are already putting the maximum amount of money into these savings vehicles and you are looking for an investment to grow even more money taxdeferred then this annuity might make sense however if security is an issue – for example you are ten or fewer years away from retirement – then other more secure options might be a better choice there are taxdeferred investments out there that can grow your money without exposing it directly to the stock market loss second even though the tiaacref intelligent annuity does an admirable job of keeping its fees low for a variable annuity using it as an accumulation vehicle has several drawbacks as an insurance product participating in the stock market you will be charged fees on both sides of the table while the management fees charged for each mutual fund selection are reasonable and fair you’re also going to get hit on the insurance end while growing that money this variable annuity like all variable annuities will deduct a mortality and expense fees and risk fees from your account every year even before you start taking income because the insurance company knows that one day they will be responsible for guaranteeing that income furthermore to ensure your beneficiaries will get this money should you pass away before turning on the income stream you also need a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which increases your fees by  the advertisements for the tiaacref point out that on a  investment each  increase in fees can decrease your savings by at least  over  years assuming a  annual rate of return tiaa cref describes the reason for this fee in the fine print of their prospectus “tiaa’s mortality risks come from its obligations to make annuity payments” if growing and accumulating money is your current goal why would any intelligent person choose an investment where you are paying out fees for something you don’t even need there’s also more to unravel here on the income side of things the tiaacref intelligent annuity does offer single and joint life guaranteed income options but because the investments inside this variable annuity work against the goal of guaranteeing income it will ultimately result in less income paid to you than what you could get from other annuities you can also expect more restrictions in order to get the guaranteed options offered by the tiaacref intelligent variable annuity your money is annuitized to annuitize basically means to trade in a sum of money in exchange for a regular income payment this means you are locked out of the account and your beneficiaries such as your spouse won’t receive any of this money when you pass away unless you have a remaining guarantee period or have elected a joint life option furthermore with this particular variable annuity you can’t change your mind and stop taking the income once you turn it on yikes yet another reason why you want to be very sure before you decide to take the plunge what about the fees the tiaacref intelligent variable annuity lives up to its claims as a lowfee variable annuity the annual charges drop after the first ten years that you own the annuity there are no surrender charges no frontload fees and the fund expenses are low as compared to other variable annuities another thing to note and this is common with all annuities is that the more money you invest the lower your charges will be the current maximum annual annuity expense charges for the tiaacref variable ranges from  to  if the guaranteed minimum death benefit is selected then the maximum expense charge ranges from  to  there is no frontend sales load charged on the sale of this annuity at the time of its purchase no surrender charge as a percentage of the premium no transfer fee or contract fee unless your annuity is under  in which case you will be charged an annual fee of  not bad for a variable annuity especially when you consider that frontload fees instantly reduce the interest earning muscle of your investment what does all of this mean to you here is a breakdown of all the fees me  to  administrative charge  to  sales charge  annual expense charge  to  fund fees  to  fee total  to  the bottom line for you the investor is this even though the intelligent variable annuity is a lowfee variable annuity it’s still a variable annuity if you don’t take the time to choose your investments based on your current needs then you’ll end up in a onesizefitsall investment designed to do everything which means you could still end up paying more in fees than you have to the annuity gators endtake on the tiaacref intelligent variable annuity where it works best as an investment for people who are already making the maximum contributions to their ira or k savings plan and have additional money they want to put away as a catchup investment to accumulate more money for retirement in a taxdeferred vehicle for investors who need a source of guaranteed income delivered by a company with an excellent track record where it works worst for young investors who are not currently investing in their company k or a traditional ira for investors who do not need a source of guaranteed income for investors who will be retiring in the next  to  years and don’t need to take on additional risk in their portfolio in summary variable annuities like this one are often sold as the magic solution to the retirement conundrum because they can do two things at once grow your money and structure it later for guaranteed income the tiaacref intelligent variable annuity does live up to its claim as a lowfee variable annuity compared to other variable annuities but you can find other investments that do a better job of growth or income preservation for the same low fees particularly if you are at or nearing retirement in terms of growth you will be charged the fund management fees in addition to the me fees charged by the insurance company regardless of when you actually need the income also remember that higher return rates within the variable annuity do not mean that you will get higher income payouts as an income producing investment this particular variable annuity requires annuitization in order to receive income payments which means you will be locked into your decisions and denied access to your money as a lump sum there are other options out there that can give you a lot more flexibility and a higher income payout for the same promise of low fees so what does all this mean to you if you are at or near retirement and concerned about the preservation of your money then you should be aware that a variable annuity does expose your money to market risk which makes it difficult for the insurance company to guarantee you an income payment the result is a lower monthly income than you would get with other annuities designed to hedge against inflation such as the fixed indexed annuity that don’t have that risky variable

accounts we incur transaction costs and the underlying funds incur expenses for buying and selling securities these costs are borne by all contractowners in addition market timing can interfere with efficient portfolio management and cause dilution if timers are able to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies the risk of pricing inefficiencies can be particularly acute for portfolios invested primarily in foreign securities such as the tiaacref international equity fund the tiaacref international equity index fund the tiaacref emerging markets equity fund the tiaacref emerging markets equity index fund the american funds europacific growth fund the vanguard emerging markets stock index fund the dodge  cox international stock fund and the dfa emerging markets portfolio we have

under these policies and procedures contractowners who make a transfer out of any one of the investment accounts available under the contract other than the investment accounts that invest in the tiaacref money market fund and the tiaacref shortterm bond fund will not be able to make electronic transfers ie over the internet by telephone or by fax back into that same investment account in that

withdrawals systematic purchases automatic rebalancings death and hardship withdrawals certain transactions made within a retirement or employee benefit plan such as contributions mandatory distributions loans and plan sponsorinitiated transactions and other types of transactions specified by tiaa management to the extent permitted by applicable law we may reject limit defer or impose other conditions on transfers into or out of an investment account in order to curb frequent transfer activity to the extent that comparable limitations are imposed on the purchase redemption or exchange of shares of any of the funds under the separate account if we regard the transfer activity as disruptive to an underlying fund’s efficient portfolio management based on the timing or amount of the investment or because of a history of excessive trading by the investor we may limit a contractowner’s ability to make transfers by telephone fax or over the internet we also may stop doing business with financial advisors who engage in excessive transfer activity on behalf of their clients because we have discretion in applying these policies it is possible that similar activity could be handled differently with the result that some market timing activity may not be detected we seek to apply our market timing and other transfer policies uniformly to all contractowners we reserve the right to waive these policies where management believes that the waiver is in the contractowners’ best interests and that imposition of the policy’s restrictions is not necessary to protect contractowners from the effects of shortterm trading except as stated above no exceptions are made with respect to the policies the contract is not appropriate for market timing you should not invest in the contract if you want to engage in market timing activity to the extent permitted by applicable law we may not accept or we may defer transfers at any time that we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of any of the funds under the separate account contractowners seeking to engage in market timing may deploy a variety of strategies to avoid detection and despite our efforts to discourage market timing there is no guarantee that tiaa or its agents will be able to identify all market timers or curtail their trading practices if we do not identify or curtail market timers there could be dilution in the value of account shares held by longterm participants increased transaction costs and interference with the efficient portfolio management of the affected fund the funds available as investment options under the contract may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to market timing and excessive trading of their respective shares the prospectuses for the funds describe any such policies and procedures the policies and procedures of a fund may be different and more or less restrictive than our policies and procedures or the policies and procedures of other funds while we reserve the right to enforce these policies     dccs va insurance product nscc membership number    and procedures we may not have the contractual authority or the operational capacity to apply the market timing and excessive trading polices and procedures of the funds however we have entered into a written agreement as required by sec regulation with each fund or its principal underwriter that obligates us to provide to the fund promptly upon request certain information about the trading activity of individual contractowners and to execute instructions from the fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific contractowners who violate the market timing and excessive trading policies established by the fund in addition some funds may impose redemption fees on shortterm trading ie redemptions of fund shares within a certain number of days after purchase the fund determines the amount of the redemption fee and the fee is retained by or paid to the fund assessing the redemption fee and not by tiaa the redemption fee may affect the number and value of accumulation units transferred out of the investment account that
