fairvanity fairsign inthe aughtsmonsanto’s harvest of fearmonsanto already dominates america’s food chain with its genetically modified seeds now it has targeted milk production just as frightening as the corporation’s tactics–ruthless legal battles against small farmers–is its decadeslong history of toxic contaminationby donald l barlett and james b steelemay emailfacebooktwitterno thanks an antimonsanto crop circle made by farmers and volunteers in the philippines by melvyn calderongreenpeace hoap imagesgary rinehart clearly remembers the summer day in  when the stranger walked in and issued his threat rinehart was behind the counter of the square deal his “oldtime country store” as he calls it on the fading town square of eagleville missouri a tiny farm community  miles north of kansas citythe square deal is a fixture in eagleville a place where farmers and townspeople can go for lightbulbs greeting cards hunting gear ice cream aspirin and dozens of other small items without having to drive to a bigbox store in bethany the county seat  miles down interstate everyone knows rinehart who was born and raised in the area and runs one of eagleville’s few surviving businesses the stranger came up to the counter and asked for him by name“well that’s me” said rinehartas rinehart would recall the man began verbally attacking him saying he had proof that rinehart had planted monsanto’s genetically modified gm soybeans in violation of the company’s patent better come clean and settle with monsanto rinehart says the man told him—or face the consequencesrinehart was incredulous listening to the words as puzzled customers and employees looked on like many others in rural america rinehart knew of monsanto’s fierce reputation for enforcing its patents and suing anyone who allegedly violated them but rinehart wasn’t a farmer he wasn’t a seed dealer he hadn’t planted any seeds or sold any seeds he owned a small—a really small—country store in a town of  people he was angry that somebody could just barge into the store and embarrass him in front of everyone “it made me and my business look bad” he says rinehart says he told the intruder “you got the wrong guy”when the stranger persisted rinehart showed him the door on the way out the man kept making threats rinehart says he can’t remember the exact words but they were to the effect of “monsanto is big you can’t win we will get you you will pay”scenes like this are playing out in many parts of rural america these days as monsanto goes after farmers farmers’ coops seed dealers—anyone it suspects may have infringed its patents of genetically modified seeds as interviews and reams of court documents reveal monsanto relies on a shadowy army of private investigators and agents in the american heartland to strike fear into farm country they fan out into fields and farm towns where they secretly videotape and photograph farmers store owners and coops infiltrate community meetings and gather information from informants about farming activities farmers say that some monsanto agents pretend to be surveyors others confront farmers on their land and try to pressure them to sign papers giving monsanto access to their private records farmers call them the “seed police” and use words such as “gestapo” and “mafia” to describe their tacticswhen asked about these practices monsanto declined to comment specifically other than to say that the company is simply protecting its patents “monsanto spends more than  million a day in research to identify test develop and bring to market innovative new seeds and technologies that benefit farmers” monsanto spokesman darren wallis wrote in an emailed letter to vanity fair “one tool in protecting this investment is patenting our discoveries and if necessary legally defending those patents against those who might choose to infringe upon them” wallis said that while the vast majority of farmers and seed dealers follow the licensing agreements “a tiny fraction” do not and that monsanto is obligated to those who do abide by its rules to enforce its patent rights on those who “reap the benefits of the technology without paying for its use” he said only a small number of cases ever go to trialsome compare monsanto’s hardline approach to microsoft’s zealous efforts to protect its software from pirates at least with microsoft the buyer of a program can use it over and over again but farmers who buy monsanto’s seeds can’t even do thatthe control of naturefor centuries—millennia—farmers have saved seeds from season to season they planted in the spring harvested in the fall then reclaimed and cleaned the seeds over the winter for replanting the next spring monsanto has turned this ancient practice on its headmonsanto developed gm seeds that would resist its own herbicide roundup offering farmers a convenient way to spray fields with weed killer without affecting crops monsanto then patented the seeds for nearly all of its history the united states patent and trademark office had refused to grant patents on seeds viewing them as lifeforms with too many variables to be patented “it’s not like describing a widget” says joseph mendelson iii the legal director of the center for food safety which has tracked monsanto’s activities in rural america for yearsindeed not but in  the us supreme court in a fivetofour decision turned seeds into widgets laying the groundwork for a handful of corporations to begin taking control of the world’s food supply in its decision the court extended patent law to cover “a live humanmade microorganism” in this case the organism wasn’t even a seed rather it was a pseudomonas bacterium developed by a general electric scientist to clean up oil spills but the precedent was set and monsanto took advantage of it since the s monsanto has become the world leader in genetic modification of seeds and has won  biotechnology patents more than any other company according to us department of agriculture datafarmers who buy monsanto’s patented roundup ready seeds are required to sign an agreement promising not to save the seed produced after each harvest for replanting or to sell the seed to other farmers this means that farmers must buy new seed every year those increased sales coupled with ballooning sales of its roundup weed killer have been a bonanza for monsantothis radical departure from ageold practice has created turmoil in farm country some farmers don’t fully understand that they aren’t supposed to save monsanto’s seeds for next year’s planting others do but ignore the stipulation rather than throw away a perfectly usable product still others say that they don’t use monsanto’s genetically modified seeds but seeds have been blown into their fields by wind or deposited by birds it’s certainly easy for gm seeds to get mixed in with traditional varieties when seeds are cleaned by commercial dealers for replanting the seeds look identical only a laboratory analysis can show the difference even if a farmer doesn’t buy gm seeds and doesn’t want them on his land it’s a safe bet he’ll get a visit from monsanto’s seed police if crops grown from gm seeds are discovered in his fieldsmost americans know monsanto because of what it sells to put on our lawns— the ubiquitous weed killer roundup what they may not know is that the company now profoundly influences—and one day may virtually control—what we put on our tables for most of its history monsanto was a chemical giant producing some of the most toxic substances ever created residues from which have left us with some of the most polluted sites on earth yet in a little more than a decade the company has sought to shed its polluted past and morph into something much different and more farreaching—an “agricultural company” dedicated to making the world “a better place for future generations” still more than one web log claims to see similarities between monsanto and the fictional company “unorth” in the movie michael clayton an agribusiness giant accused in a multibilliondollar lawsuit of selling an herbicide that causes cancermonsanto brought false accusations against gary rinehart—shown here at his rural missouri store there has been no apology photographs by kurt markusmonsanto’s genetically modified seeds have transformed the company and are radically altering global agriculture so far the company has produced gm seeds for soybeans corn canola and cotton many more products have been developed or are in the pipeline including seeds for sugar beets and alfalfa the company is also seeking to extend its reach into milk production by marketing an artificial growth hormone for cows that increases their output and it is taking aggressive steps to put those who don’t want to use growth hormone at a commercial disadvantageeven as the company is pushing its gm agenda monsanto is buying up conventionalseed companies in  monsanto paid  billion for seminis which controlled  percent of the us market for lettuce tomatoes and other vegetable and fruit seeds two weeks later it announced the acquisition of the country’s thirdlargest cottonseed company emergent genetics for  million it’s estimated that monsanto seeds now account for  percent of the us production of soybeans which are used in food products beyond counting monsanto’s acquisitions have fueled explosive growth transforming the st louis–based corporation into the largest seed company in the worldin iraq the groundwork has been laid to protect the patents of monsanto and other gmseed companies one of l paul bremer’s last acts as head of the coalition provisional authority was an order stipulating that “farmers shall be prohibited from reusing seeds of protected varieties” monsanto has said that it has no interest in doing business in iraq but should the company change its mind the americanstyle law is in placeto be sure more and more agricultural corporations and individual farmers are using monsanto’s gm seeds as recently as  no genetically modified crops were grown in the us in  the total was  million acres planted worldwide the figure was  million acres many farmers believe that gm seeds increase crop yields and save money another reason for their attraction is convenience by using roundup ready soybean seeds a farmer can spend less time tending to his fields with monsanto seeds a farmer plants his crop then treats it later with roundup to kill weeds that takes the place of laborintensive weed control and plowingmonsanto portrays its move into gm seeds as a giant leap for mankind but out in the american countryside monsanto’s noholdsbarred tactics have made it feared and loathed like it or not farmers say they have fewer and fewer choices in buying seedsand controlling the seeds is not some abstraction whoever provides the world’s seeds controls the world’s food supplyunder surveillanceafter monsanto’s investigator confronted gary rinehart monsanto filed a federal lawsuit alleging that rinehart “knowingly intentionally and willfully” planted seeds “in violation of monsanto’s patent rights” the company’s complaint made it sound as if monsanto had rinehart dead to rightsduring the  growing season investigator jeffery moore through surveillance of mr rinehart’s farm facility and farming operations observed defendant planting brown bag soybean seed mr moore observed the defendant take the brown bag soybeans to a field which was subsequently loaded into a grain drill and planted mr moore located two empty bags in the ditch in the public road rightofway beside one of the fields planted by rinehart which contained some soybeans mr moore collected a small amount of soybeans left in the bags which defendant had tossed into the public rightof way these samples tested positive for monsanto’s roundup ready technologyfaced with a federal lawsuit rinehart had to hire a lawyer monsanto eventually realized that “investigator jeffery moore” had targeted the wrong man and dropped the suit rinehart later learned that the company had been secretly investigating farmers in his area rinehart never heard from monsanto again no letter of apology no public concession that the company had made a terrible mistake no offer to pay his attorney’s fees “i don’t know how they get away with it” he says “if i tried to do something like that it would be bad news i felt like i was in another country”gary rinehart is actually one of monsanto’s luckier targets ever since commercial introduction of its gm seeds in  monsanto has launched thousands of investigations and filed lawsuits against hundreds of farmers and seed dealers in a  report the center for food safety in washington dc documented  such lawsuits in  stateseven more significant in the center’s opinion are the numbers of farmers who settle because they don’t have the money or the time to fight monsanto “the number of cases filed is only the tip of the iceberg” says bill freese the center’s sciencepolicy analyst freese says he has been told of many cases in which monsanto investigators showed up at a farmer’s house or confronted him in his fields claiming he had violated the technology agreement and demanding to see his records according to freese investigators will say “monsanto knows that you are saving roundup ready seeds and if you don’t sign these informationrelease forms monsanto is going to come after you and take your farm or take you for all you’re worth” investigators will sometimes show a farmer a photo of himself coming out of a store to let him know he is being followedlawyers who have represented farmers sued by monsanto say that intimidating actions like these are commonplace most give in and pay monsanto some amount in damages those who resist face the full force of monsanto’s legal wrathscorchedearth tacticspilot grove missouri population  sits in rolling farmland  miles west of st louis the town has a grocery store a bank a bar a nursing home a funeral parlor and a few other small businesses there are no stoplights but the town doesn’t need any the little traffic it has comes from trucks on their way to and from the grain elevator on the edge of town the elevator is owned by a local coop the pilot grove cooperative elevator which buys soybeans and corn from farmers in the fall then ships out the grain over the winter the coop has seven fulltime employees and four computersin the fall of  monsanto trained its legal guns on pilot grove ever since its farmers have been drawn into a costly disruptive legal battle against an opponent with limitless resources neither pilot grove nor monsanto will discuss the case but it is possible to piece together much of the story from documents filed as part of the litigationmonsanto began investigating soybean farmers in and around pilot grove several years ago there is no indication as to what sparked the probe but monsanto periodically investigates farmers in soybeangrowing regions such as this one in central missouri the company has a staff devoted to enforcing patents and litigating against farmers to gather leads the company maintains an  number and encourages farmers to inform on other farmers they think may be engaging in “seed piracy”once pilot grove had been targeted monsanto sent private investigators into the area over a period of months monsanto’s investigators surreptitiously followed the coop’s employees and customers and videotaped them in fields and going about other activities at least  such surveillance videos were made according to court records the investigative work was outsourced to a st louis agency mcdowell  associates it was a mcdowell investigator who erroneously fingered gary rinehart in pilot grove at least  mcdowell investigators have worked the case and monsanto makes no bones about the extent of this effort “surveillance was conducted throughout the year by various investigators in the field” according to court records mcdowell like monsanto will not comment on the casenot long after investigators showed up in pilot grove monsanto subpoenaed the coop’s records concerning seed and herbicide purchases and seedcleaning operations the coop provided more than  pages of documents pertaining to dozens of farmers monsanto sued two farmers and negotiated settlements with more than  others it accused of seed piracy but monsanto’s legal assault had only begun although the coop had provided voluminous records monsanto then sued it in federal court for patent infringement monsanto contended that by cleaning seeds—a service which it had provided for decades—the coop was inducing farmers to violate monsanto’s patents in effect monsanto wanted the coop to police its own customersin the majority of cases where monsanto sues or threatens to sue farmers settle before going to trial the cost and stress of litigating against a global corporation are just too great but pilot grove wouldn’t cave—and ever since monsanto has been turning up the heat the more the coop has resisted the more legal firepower monsanto has aimed at it pilot grove’s lawyer steven h schwartz described monsanto in a court filing as pursuing a “scorched earth tactic” intent on “trying to drive the coop into the ground”even after pilot grove turned over thousands more pages of sales records going back five years and covering virtually every one of its farmer customers monsanto wanted more—the right to inspect the coop’s hard drives when the coop offered to provide an electronic version of any record monsanto demanded handson access to pilot grove’s inhouse computersmonsanto next petitioned to make potential damages punitive—tripling the amount that pilot grove might have to pay if found guilty after a judge denied that request monsanto expanded the scope of the pretrial investigation by seeking to quadruple the number of depositions “monsanto is doing its best to make this case so expensive to defend that the coop will have no choice but to relent” pilot grove’s lawyer said in a court filingwith pilot grove still holding out for a trial monsanto now subpoenaed the records of more than  of the coop’s customers in a “you are commanded … ” notice the farmers were ordered to gather up five years of invoices receipts and all other papers relating to their soybean and herbicide purchases and to have the documents delivered to a law office in st louis monsanto gave them two weeks to complywhether pilot grove can continue to wage its legal battle remains to be seen whatever the outcome the case shows why monsanto is so detested in farm country even by those who buy its products “i don’t know of a company that chooses to sue its own customer base” says joseph mendelson of the center for food safety “it’s a very bizarre business strategy” but it’s one that monsanto manages to get away with because increasingly it’s the dominant vendor in townchemicals what chemicalsthe monsanto company has never been one of america’s friendliest corporate citizens given monsanto’s current dominance in the field of bioengineering it’s worth looking at the company’s own dna the future of the company may lie in seeds but the seeds of the company lie in chemicals communities around the world are still reaping the environmental consequences of monsanto’s originsmonsanto was founded in  by john francis queeny a tough cigarsmoking irishman with a sixthgrade education a buyer for a wholesale drug company queeny had an idea but like a lot of employees with ideas he found that his boss wouldn’t listen to him so he went into business for himself on the side queeny was convinced there was money to be made manufacturing a substance called saccharin an artificial sweetener then imported from germany he took  of his savings borrowed another  and set up shop in a dingy warehouse near the st louis waterfront with borrowed equipment and secondhand machines he began producing saccharin for the us market he called the company the monsanto chemical works monsanto being his wife’s maiden namethe german cartel that controlled the market for saccharin wasn’t pleased and cut the price from  to  a pound to try to force queeny out of business the young company faced other challenges questions arose about the safety of saccharin and the us department of agriculture even tried to ban it fortunately for queeny he wasn’t up against opponents as aggressive and litigious as the monsanto of today his persistence and the loyalty of one steady customer kept the company afloat that steady customer was a new company in georgia named cocacolamonsanto added more and more products—vanillin caffeine and drugs used as sedatives and laxatives in  monsanto began making aspirin and soon became the largest maker worldwide during world war i cut off from imported european chemicals monsanto was forced to manufacture its own and its position as a leading force in the chemical industry was assuredafter queeny was diagnosed with cancer in the late s his only son edgar became president where the father had been a classic entrepreneur edgar monsanto queeny was an empire builder with a grand vision it was edgar—shrewd daring and intuitive “he can see around the next corner” his secretary once said—who built monsanto into a global powerhouse under edgar queeny and his successors monsanto extended its reach into a phenomenal number of products plastics resins rubber goods fuel additives artificial caffeine industrial fluids vinyl siding dishwasher detergent antifreeze fertilizers herbicides pesticides its safety glass protects the us constitution and the mona lisa its synthetic fibers are the basis of astroturfduring the s the company shifted more and more resources into biotechnology in  it created a molecularbiology group for research in plant genetics the next year monsanto scientists hit gold they became the first to genetically modify a plant cell “it will now be possible to introduce virtually any gene into plant cells with the ultimate goal of improving crop productivity” said ernest jaworski director of monsanto’s biological sciences programover the next few years scientists working mainly in the company’s vast new life sciences research center  miles west of st louis developed one genetically modified product after another—cotton soybeans corn canola from the start gm seeds were controversial with the public as well as with some farmers and european consumers monsanto has sought to portray gm seeds as a panacea a way to alleviate poverty and feed the hungry robert shapiro monsanto’s president during the s once called gm seeds “the single most successful introduction of technology in the history of agriculture including the plow”by the late s monsanto having rebranded itself into a “life sciences” company had spun off its chemical and fibers operations into a new company called solutia after an additional reorganization monsanto reincorporated in  and officially declared itself an “agricultural company”in its company literature monsanto now refers to itself disingenuously as a “relatively new company” whose primary goal is helping “farmers around the world in their mission to feed clothe and fuel” a growing planet in its list of corporate milestones all but a handful are from the recent era as for the company’s early history the decades when it grew into an industrial powerhouse now held potentially responsible for more than  environmental protection agency superfund sites—none of that is mentioned it’s as though the original monsanto the company that long had the word “chemical” as part of its name never existed one of the benefits of doing this as the company does not point out was to channel the bulk of the growing backlog of chemical lawsuits and liabilities onto solutia keeping the monsanto brand purebut monsanto’s past especially its environmental legacy is very much with us for many years monsanto produced two of the most toxic substances ever known— polychlorinated biphenyls better known as pcbs and dioxin monsanto no longer produces either but the places where it did are still struggling with the aftermath and probably always will be“systemic intoxication”twelve miles downriver from charleston west virginia is the town of nitro where monsanto operated a chemical plant from  to  in  the plant began to make a powerful herbicide known as t called “weed bug” by the workers a byproduct of the process was the creation of a chemical that would later be known as dioxinthe name dioxin refers to a group of highly toxic chemicals that have been linked to heart disease liver disease human reproductive disorders and developmental problems even in small amounts dioxin persists in the environment and accumulates in the body in  the international agency for research on cancer a branch of the world health organization classified the most powerful form of dioxin as a substance that causes cancer in humans in  the us government listed the chemical as a “known human carcinogen”on march   a massive explosion rocked monsanto’s nitro plant when a pressure valve blew on a container cooking up a batch of herbicide the noise from the release was a scream so loud that it drowned out the emergency steam whistle for five minutes a plume of vapor and white smoke drifted across the plant and out over townresidue from the explosion coated the interior of the building and those inside with what workers described as “a fine black powder” many felt their skin prickle and were told to scrub downwithin days workers experienced skin eruptions many were soon diagnosed with chloracne a condition similar to common acne but more severe longer lasting and potentially disfiguring others felt intense pains in their legs chest and trunk a confidential medical report at the time said the explosion “caused a systemic intoxication in the workers involving most major organ systems” doctors who examined four of the most seriously injured men detected a strong odor coming from them when they were all together in a closed room “we believe these men are excreting a foreign chemical through their skins” the confidential report to monsanto noted court records indicate that  plant workers became illaccording to court documents that have surfaced in a west virginia court case monsanto downplayed the impact stating that the contaminant affecting workers was “fairly slow acting” and caused “only an irritation of the skin”in the meantime the nitro plant continued to produce herbicides rubber products and other chemicals in the s the factory manufactured agent orange the powerful herbicide which the us military used to defoliate jungles during the vietnam war and which later was the focus of lawsuits by veterans contending that they had been harmed by exposure as with monsanto’s older herbicides the manufacturing of agent orange created dioxin as a byproductas for the nitro plant’s waste some was burned in incinerators some dumped in landfills or storm drains some allowed to run into streams as stuart calwell a lawyer who has represented both workers and residents in nitro put it “dioxin went wherever the product went down the sewer shipped in bags and when the waste was burned out in the air”in  several former nitro employees filed lawsuits in federal court charging that monsanto had knowingly exposed them to chemicals that caused longterm health problems including cancer and heart disease they alleged that monsanto knew that many chemicals used at nitro were potentially harmful but had kept that information from them on the eve of a trial in  monsanto agreed to settle most of the cases by making a single lump payment of  million monsanto also agreed to drop its claim to collect  in court costs from six retired monsanto workers who had unsuccessfully charged in another lawsuit that monsanto had recklessly exposed them to dioxin monsanto had attached liens to the retirees’ homes to guarantee collection of the debtmonsanto stopped producing dioxin in nitro in  but the toxic chemical can still be found well beyond the nitro plant site repeated studies have found elevated levels of dioxin in nearby rivers streams and fish residents have sued to seek damages from monsanto and solutia earlier this year a west virginia judge merged those lawsuits into a classaction suit a monsanto spokesman said “we believe the allegations are without merit and we’ll defend ourselves vigorously” the suit will no doubt take years to play out time is one thing that monsanto always has and that the plaintiffs usually don’tpoisoned lawnsfive hundred miles to the south the people of anniston alabama know all about what the people of nitro are going through they’ve been there in fact you could say they’re still therefrom  to  monsanto’s anniston works produced pcbs as industrial coolants and insulating fluids for transformers and other electrical equipment one of the wonder chemicals of the th century pcbs were exceptionally versatile and fireresistant and became central to many american industries as lubricants hydraulic fluids and sealants but pcbs are toxic a member of a family of chemicals that mimic hormones pcbs have been linked to damage in the liver and in the neurological immune endocrine and reproductive systems the environmental protection agency epa and the agency for toxic substances and disease registry part of the department of health and human services now classify pcbs as “probable carcinogens”today  years after pcb production ceased in anniston and after tons of contaminated soil have been removed to try to reclaim the site the area around the old monsanto plant remains one of the most polluted spots in the uspeople in anniston find themselves in this fix today largely because of the way monsanto disposed of pcb waste for decades excess pcbs were dumped in a nearby openpit landfill or allowed to flow off the property with storm water some waste was poured directly into snow creek which runs alongside the plant and empties into a larger stream choccolocco creek pcbs also turned up in private lawns after the company invited anniston residents to use soil from the plant for their lawns according to the anniston starso for decades the people of anniston breathed air planted gardens drank from wells fished in rivers and swam in creeks contaminated with pcbs—without knowing anything about the danger it wasn’t until the s— years after monsanto stopped making pcbs in anniston—that widespread public awareness of the problem there took holdstudies by health authorities consistently found elevated levels of pcbs in houses yards streams fields fish and other wildlife—and in people in  monsanto and solutia entered into a consent decree with the epa to clean up anniston scores of houses and small businesses were to be razed tons of contaminated soil dug up and carted off and streambeds scooped of toxic residue the cleanup is under way and it will take years but some doubt it will ever be completed—the job is massive to settle residents’ claims monsanto has also paid  million to  anniston residents exposed to pcbs but many of them continue to live with pcbs in their bodies once pcb is absorbed into human tissue there it forever remainsmonsanto shut down pcb production in anniston in  and the company ended all its american pcb operations in  also in  monsanto closed a pcb plant in wales in recent years residents near the village of groesfaen in southern wales have noticed vile odors emanating from an old quarry outside the village as it turns out monsanto had dumped thousands of tons of waste from its nearby pcb plant into the quarry british authorities are struggling to decide what to do with what they have now identified as among the most contaminated places in britain“no cause for public alarm”what had monsanto known—or what should it have known—about the potential dangers of the chemicals it was manufacturing there’s considerable documentation lurking in court records from many lawsuits indicating that monsanto knew quite a lot let’s look just at the example of pcbsthe evidence that monsanto refused to face questions about their toxicity is quite clear in  the company tried to sell the navy a hydraulic fluid for its submarines called pydraul  which contained pcbs monsanto supplied the navy with test results for the product but the navy decided to run its own tests afterward navy officials informed monsanto that they wouldn’t be buying the product “applications of pydraul  caused death in all of the rabbits tested” and indicated “definite liver damage” navy officials told monsanto according to an internal monsanto memo divulged in the course of a court proceeding “no matter how we discussed the situation” complained monsanto’s medical director r emmet kelly “it was impossible to change their thinking that pydraul  is just too toxic for use in submarines”ten years later a biologist conducting studies for monsanto in streams near the anniston plant got quick results when he submerged his test fish as he reported to monsanto according to the washington post “all  fish lost equilibrium and turned on their sides in  seconds and all were dead in ½ minutes”jeff kleinpeter of baton rouge was accused by monsanto of making misleading claims just for telling customers his cows are free of artificial bovine growth hormonewhen the food and drug administration fda turned up high levels of pcbs in fish near the anniston plant in  the company swung into action to limit the pr damage an internal memo entitled “confidential—fyi and destroy” from monsanto official paul b hodges reviewed steps under way to limit disclosure of the information one element of the strategy was to get public officials to fight monsanto’s battle “joe crockett secretary of the alabama water improvement commission will try to handle the problem quietly without release of the information to the public at this time” according to the memodespite monsanto’s efforts the information did get out but the company was able to blunt its impact monsanto’s anniston plant manager “convinced” a reporter for the anniston star that there was really nothing to worry about and an internal memo from monsanto’s headquarters in st louis summarized the story that subsequently appeared in the newspaper “quoting both plant management and the alabama water improvement commission the feature emphasized the pcb problem was relatively new was being solved by monsanto and at this point was no cause for public alarm”in truth there was enormous cause for public alarm but that harm was done by the “original monsanto company” not “today’s monsanto company” the words and the distinction are monsanto’s the monsanto of today says that it can be trusted—that its biotech crops are “as wholesome nutritious and safe as conventional crops” and that milk from cows injected with its artificial growth hormone is the same as and as safe as milk from any other cowthe milk warsjeff kleinpeter takes very good care of his dairy cows in the winter he turns on heaters to warm their barns in the summer fans blow gentle breezes to cool them and on especially hot days a fine mist floats down to take the edge off louisiana’s heat the dairy has gone “to the ultimate end of the earth for cow comfort” says kleinpeter a fourthgeneration dairy farmer in baton rouge he says visitors marvel at what he does “i’ve had many of them say ‘when i die i want to come back as a kleinpeter cow’ ”monsanto would like to change the way jeff kleinpeter and his family do business specifically monsanto doesn’t like the label on kleinpeter dairy’s milk cartons “from cows not treated with rbgh” to consumers that means the milk comes from cows that were not given artificial bovine growth hormone a supplement developed by monsanto that can be injected into dairy cows to increase their milk outputno one knows what effect if any the hormone has on milk or the people who drink it studies have not detected any difference in the quality of milk produced by cows that receive rbgh or rbst a term by which it is also known but jeff kleinpeter—like millions of consumers—wants no part of rbgh whatever its effect on humans if any kleinpeter feels certain it’s harmful to cows because it speeds up their metabolism and increases the chances that they’ll contract a painful illness that can shorten their lives “it’s like putting a volkswagen car in with the indianapolis  racers” he says “you gotta keep the pedal to the metal the whole way through and pretty soon that poor little volkswagen engine’s going to burn up”kleinpeter dairy has never used monsanto’s artificial hormone and the dairy requires other dairy farmers from whom it buys milk to attest that they don’t use it either at the suggestion of a marketing consultant the dairy began advertising its milk as coming from rbghfree cows in  and the label began appearing on kleinpeter milk cartons and in company literature including a new web site of kleinpeter products that proclaims “we treat our cows with love … not rbgh”the dairy’s sales soared for kleinpeter it was simply a matter of giving consumers more information about their productbut giving consumers that information has stirred the ire of monsanto the company contends that advertising by kleinpeter and other dairies touting their “no rbgh” milk reflects adversely on monsanto’s product in a letter to the federal trade commission in february  monsanto said that notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that there is no difference in the milk from cows treated with its product “milk processors persist in claiming on their labels and in advertisements that the use of rbst is somehow harmful either to cows or to the people who consume milk from rbstsupplemented cows”monsanto called on the commission to investigate what it called the “deceptive advertising and labeling practices” of milk processors such as kleinpeter accusing them of misleading consumers “by falsely claiming that there are health and safety risks associated with milk from rbstsupplemented cows” as noted kleinpeter does not make any such claims—he simply states that his milk comes from cows not injected with rbghmonsanto’s attempt to get the ftc to force dairies to change their advertising was just one more step in the corporation’s efforts to extend its reach into agriculture after years of scientific debate and public controversy the fda in  approved commercial use of rbst basing its decision in part on studies submitted by monsanto that decision allowed the company to market the artificial hormone the effect of the hormone is to increase milk production not exactly something the nation needed then—or needs now the us was actually awash in milk with the government buying up the surplus to prevent a collapse in pricesmonsanto began selling the supplement in  under the name posilac monsanto acknowledges that the possible side effects of rbst for cows include lameness disorders of the uterus increased body temperature digestive problems and birthing difficulties veterinary drug reports note that “cows injected with posilac are at an increased risk for mastitis” an udder infection in which bacteria and pus may be pumped out with the milk what’s the effect on humans the fda has consistently said that the milk produced by cows that receive rbgh is the same as milk from cows that aren’t injected “the public can be confident that milk and meat from bsttreated cows is safe to consume” nevertheless some scientists are concerned by the lack of longterm studies to test the additive’s impact especially on children a wisconsin geneticist william von meyer observed that when rbgh was approved the longest study on which the fda’s approval was based covered only a day laboratory test with small animals “but people drink milk for a lifetime” he noted canada and the european union have never approved the commercial sale of the artificial hormone today nearly  years after the fda approved rbgh there have still been no longterm studies “to determine the safety of milk from cows that receive artificial growth hormone” says michael hansen senior staff scientist for consumers union not only have there been no studies he adds but the data that does exist all comes from monsanto “there is no scientific consensus about the safety” he sayshowever fda approval came about monsanto has long been wired into washington michael r taylor was a staff attorney and executive assistant to the fda commissioner before joining a law firm in washington in  where he worked to secure fda approval of monsanto’s artificial growth hormone before returning to the fda as deputy commissioner in  dr michael a friedman formerly the fda’s deputy commissioner for operations joined monsanto in  as a senior vice president linda j fisher was an assistant administrator at the epa when she left the agency in  she became a vice president of monsanto from  to  only to return to the epa as deputy administrator the next year william d ruckelshaus former epa administrator and mickey kantor former us trade representative each served on monsanto’s board after leaving government supreme court justice clarence thomas was an attorney in monsanto’s corporatelaw department in the s he wrote the supreme court opinion in a crucial gmseed patentrights case in  that benefited monsanto and all gmseed companies donald rumsfeld never served on the board or held any office at monsanto but monsanto must occupy a soft spot in the heart of the former defense secretary rumsfeld was chairman and ceo of the pharmaceutical maker g d searle  co when monsanto acquired searle in  after searle had experienced difficulty in finding a buyer rumsfeld’s stock and options in searle were valued at  million at the time of the salefrom the beginning some consumers have consistently been hesitant to drink milk from cows treated with artificial hormones this is one reason monsanto has waged so many battles with dairies and regulators over the wording of labels on milk cartons it has sued at least two dairies and one coop over labelingcritics of the artificial hormone have pushed for mandatory labeling on all milk products but the fda has resisted and even taken action against some dairies that labeled their milk “bstfree” since bst is a natural hormone found in all cows including those not injected with monsanto’s artificial version the fda argued that no dairy could claim that its milk is bstfree the fda later issued guidelines allowing dairies to use labels saying their milk comes from “nonsupplemented cows” as long as the carton has a disclaimer saying that the artificial supplement does not in any way change the milk so the milk cartons from kleinpeter dairy for example carry a label on the front stating that the milk is from cows not treated with rbgh and the rear panel says “government studies have shown no significant difference between milk derived from rbghtreated and nonrbghtreated cows” that’s not good enough for monsantothe next battlegroundas more and more dairies have chosen to advertise their milk as “no rbgh” monsanto has gone on the offensive its attempt to force the ftc to look into what monsanto called “deceptive practices” by dairies trying to distance themselves from the company’s artificial hormone was the most recent national salvo but after reviewing monsanto’s claims the ftc’s division of advertising practices decided in august  that a “formal investigation and enforcement action is not warranted at this time” the agency found some instances where dairies had made “unfounded health and safety claims” but these were mostly on web sites not on milk cartons and the ftc determined that the dairies monsanto had singled out all carried disclaimers that the fda had found no significant differences in milk from cows treated with the artificial hormoneblocked at the federal level monsanto is pushing for action by the states in the fall of  pennsylvania’s agriculture secretary dennis wolff issued an edict prohibiting dairies from stamping milk containers with labels stating their products were made without the use of the artificial hormone wolff said such a label implies that competitors’ milk is not safe and noted that nonsupplemented milk comes at an unjustified higher price arguments that monsanto has frequently made the ban was to take effect february  wolff’s action created a firestorm in pennsylvania and beyond from angry consumers so intense was the outpouring of emails letters and calls that pennsylvania governor edward rendell stepped in and reversed his agriculture secretary saying “the public has a right to complete information about how the milk they buy is produced”on this issue the tide may be shifting against monsanto organic dairy products which don’t involve rbgh are soaring in popularity supermarket chains such as kroger publix and safeway are embracing them some other companies have turned away from rbgh products including starbucks which has banned all milk products from cows treated with rbgh although monsanto once claimed that an estimated  percent of the nation’s dairy cows were injected with rbst it’s widely believed that today the number is much lowerbut don’t count monsanto out efforts similar to the one in pennsylvania have been launched in other states including new jersey ohio indiana kansas utah and missouri a monsantobacked group called afact—american farmers for the advancement and conservation of technology—has been spearheading efforts in many of these states afact describes itself as a “producer organization” that decries “questionable labeling tactics and activism” by marketers who have convinced some consumers to “shy away from foods using new technology” afact reportedly uses the same st louis publicrelations firm osborn  barr employed by monsanto an osborn  barr spokesman told the kansas city star that the company was doing work for afact on a pro bono basiseven if monsanto’s efforts to secure acrosstheboard labeling changes should fall short there’s nothing to stop state agriculture departments from restricting labeling on a dairybydairy basis beyond that monsanto also has allies whose foot soldiers will almost certainly keep up the pressure on dairies that don’t use monsanto’s artificial hormone jeff kleinpeter knows about them toohe got a call one day from the man who prints the labels for his milk cartons asking if he had seen the attack on kleinpeter dairy that had been posted on the internet kleinpeter went online to a site called stoplabelinglies which claims to “help consumers by publicizing examples of false and misleading food and other product labels” there sure enough kleinpeter and other dairies that didn’t use monsanto’s product were being accused of making misleading claims to sell their milkthere was no address or phone number on the web site only a list of groups that apparently contribute to the site and whose issues range from disparaging organic farming to downplaying the impact of global warming “they were criticizing people like me for doing what we had a right to do had gone through a government agency to do” says kleinpeter “we never could get to the bottom of that web site to get that corrected”as it turns out the web site counts among its contributors steven milloy the “junk science” commentator for foxnewscom and operator of junksciencecom which claims to debunk “faulty scientific data and analysis” it may come as no surprise that earlier in his career milloy who calls himself the “junkman” was a registered lobbyist for monsantodonald l barlett and james b steele are vanity fair contributing
