content search web pages submit ee business management for electrical engineers and computer scientists main page » productmarket fit on this page productmarket fit productmarket fit the only thing that matters is getting to productmarket fit by marc andreesen june   this post is all about the only thing that matters for a new startup but first some theory if you look at a broad crosssection of startups  say  or  or more enough to screen out the pure flukes and look for patterns  two obvious facts will jump out at you first obvious fact there is an incredibly wide divergence of success  some of those startups are insanely successful some highly successful many somewhat successful and quite a few of course outright fail second obvious fact there is an incredibly wide divergence of caliber and quality for the three core elements of each startup  team product and market at any given startup the team will range from outstanding to remarkably flawed the product will range from a masterpiece of engineering to barely functional and the market will range from booming to comatose and so you start to wonder  what correlates the most to success  team product or market or more bluntly what causes success and for those of us who are students of startup failure  whats most dangerous a bad team a weak product or a poor market lets start by defining terms the caliber of a startup team can be defined as the suitability of the ceo senior staff engineers and other key staff relative to the opportunity in front of them you look at a startup and ask will this team be able to optimally execute against their opportunity i focus on effectiveness as opposed to experience since the history of the tech industry is full of highly successful startups that were staffed primarily by people who had never done it before the quality of a startups product can be defined as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses it how easy is the product to use how feature rich is it how fast is it how extensible is it how polished is it how many or rather how few bugs does it have the size of a startups market is the the number and growth rate of those customers or users for that product lets assume for this discussion that you can make money at scale  that the cost of acquiring a customer isnt higher than the revenue that customer will generate some people have been objecting to my classification as follows how great can a product be if nobody wants it in other words isnt the quality of a product defined by how appealing it is to lots of customers no product quality and market size are completely different heres the classic scenario the worlds best software application for an operating system nobody runs just ask any software developer targeting the market for beos amiga os or next applications what the difference is between great product and big market so if you ask entrepreneurs or vcs which of team product or market is most important many will say team this is the obvious answer in part because in the beginning of a startup you know a lot more about the team than you do the product which hasnt been built yet or the market which hasnt been explored yet plus weve all been raised on slogans like people are our most important asset  at least in the us propeople sentiments permeate our culture ranging from high school selfesteem programs to the declaration of independences inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  so the answer that team is the most important feels right and who wants to take the position that people dont matter on the other hand if you ask engineers many will say product this is a product business startups invent products customers buy and use the products apple and google are the best companies in the industry today because they build the best products without the product there is no company just try having a great team and no product or a great market and no product whats wrong with you now let me get back to work on the product personally ill take the third position  ill assert that market is the most important factor in a startups success or failure why in a great market  a market with lots of real potential customers  the market pulls product out of the startup the market needs to be fulfilled and the market will be fulfilled by the first viable product that comes along the product doesnt need to be great it just has to basically work and the market doesnt care how good the team is as long as the team can produce that viable product in short customers are knocking down your door to get the product the main goal is to actually answer the phone and respond to all the emails from people who want to buy and when you have a great market the team is remarkably easy to upgrade on the fly this is the story of search keyword advertising and internet auctions and tcpip routers conversely in a terrible market you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team and it doesnt matter  youre going to fail youll break your pick for years trying to find customers who dont exist for your marvelous product and your wonderful team will eventually get demoralized and quit and your startup will die this is the story of videoconferencing and workflow software and micropayments in honor of andy rachleff formerly of benchmark capital who crystallized this formulation for me let me present rachleffs law of startup success the  companykiller is lack of market andy puts it this way when a great team meets a lousy market market wins when a lousy team meets a great market market wins when a great team meets a great market something special happens you can obviously screw up a great market  and that has been done and not infrequently  but assuming the team is baseline competent and the product is fundamentally acceptable a great market will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to equal failure market matters most and neither a stellar team nor a fantastic product will redeem a bad market ok so what well first question since team is the thing you have the most control over at the start and everyone wants to have a great team what does a great team actually get you hopefully a great team gets you at least an ok product and ideally a great product however i can name you a bunch of examples of great teams that totally screwed up their products great products are really really hard to build hopefully a great team also gets you a great market  but i can also name you lots of examples of great teams that executed brilliantly against terrible markets and failed markets that dont exist dont care how smart you are in my experience the most frequent case of great team paired with bad product andor terrible market is the second or thirdtime entrepreneur whose first company was a huge success people get cocky and slip up there is one highprofile highly successful software entrepreneur right now who is burning through something like  million in venture funding in his latest startup and has practically nothing to show for it except for some great press clippings and a couple of beta customers  because there is virtually no market for what he is building conversely i can name you any number of weak teams whose startups were highly successful due to explosively large markets for what they were doing finally to quote tim shephard a great team is a team that will always beat a mediocre team given the same market and product second question cant great products sometimes create huge new markets absolutely this is a best case scenario though vmware is the most recent company to have done it  vmwares product was so profoundly transformative out of the gate that it catalyzed a whole new movement toward operating system virtualization which turns out to be a monster market and of course in this scenario it also doesnt really matter how good your team is as long as the team is good enough to develop the product to the baseline level of quality the market requires and get it fundamentally to market understand im not saying that you should shoot low in terms of quality of team or that vmwares team was not incredibly strong  it was and is im saying bring a product as transformative as vmwares to market and youre going to succeed full stop short of that i wouldnt count on your product creating a new market from scratch third question as a startup founder what should i do about all this lets introduce rachleffs corollary of startup success the only thing that matters is getting to productmarket fit productmarket fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market you can always feel when productmarket fit isnt happening the customers arent quite getting value out of the product word of mouth isnt spreading usage isnt growing that fast press reviews are kind of blah the sales cycle takes too long and lots of deals never close and you can always feel productmarket fit when its happening the customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it  or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers money from customers is piling up in your company checking account youre hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can reporters are calling because theyve heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it you start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from harvard business school investment bankers are staking out your house you could eat free for a year at bucks lots of startups fail before productmarket fit ever happens my contention in fact is that they fail because they never get to productmarket fit carried a step further i believe that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts before productmarket fit call this bpmf and after productmarket fit apmf when you are bpmf focus obsessively on getting to productmarket fit do whatever is required to get to productmarket fit including changing out people rewriting your product moving into a different market telling customers no when you dont want to telling customers yes when you dont want to raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital  whatever is required when you get right down to it you can ignore almost everything else im not suggesting that you do ignore everything else  just that judging from what ive seen in successful startups you can whenever you see a successful startup you see one that has reached productmarket fit  and usually along the way screwed up all kinds of other things from channel model to pipeline development strategy to marketing plan to press relations to compensation policies to the ceo sleeping with the venture capitalist and the startup is still successful conversely you see a surprising number of really wellrun startups that have all aspects of operations completely buttoned down hr policies in place great sales model thoroughly thoughtthrough marketing plan great interview processes outstanding catered food  monitors for all the programmers top tier vcs on the board  heading straight off a cliff due to not ever finding productmarket fit ironically once a startup is successful and you ask the founders what made it successful they will usually cite all kinds of things that had nothing to do with it people are terrible at understanding causation but in almost every case the cause was actually productmarket fit because really what else could it possibly be editorial note this post obviously raises way more questions than it answers how exactly do you go about getting to productmarket fit if you dont hit it right out of the gate how do you evaluate markets for size and quality especially before theyre fully formed what actually makes a product fit a market what role does timing play how do you know when to change strategy and go after a different market or build a different product when do you need to change out some or all of your team and why cant you count on on a great team to build the right product and find the right market all these topics will be discussed in future posts in this series by marc
