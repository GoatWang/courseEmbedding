cable is a wellknown cable tv and internet provider that also offers a range of smart home security and automation packages time warner gives customers access to professional installations stateoftheart touchscreen panels  monitoring and video surveillance however these features come at a price—the upfront cost of a time warner home security system is relatively high compared to what other companies in the industry typically charge the good shorter contract lengths stateoftheart touchscreen panel broadband monitoring with cellular backup indoor or outdoor video surveillance professional installation shorter contract lengths time warner cable’s contract length for home security systems is  months which is considerably shorter than the three to fiveyear contracts required by many other companies in the industry stateoftheart touchscreen panel time warner is very transparent when it comes to providing potential customers with equipment and pricing information all packages include an inhome touchscreen panel a motion or glassbreak sensor and two doorwindow sensors then depending in which package you choose you’ll get either a smart thermostat or an indooroutdoor camera the component that really stands out in this mix is the touchscreen panel which has a sleek attractive design that will look great in any home the panel also carries a hour battery backup builtin cellular backup wifi connectivity and access to dozens of apps broadband monitoring with cellular backup as mentioned above time warner’s touchscreen panel carries hour battery backup cellular backup and wifi connectivity this means that even if your home’s electricity or internet is down you can have peace of mind knowing that your security system is still up and running indoor or outdoor video surveillance many home security companies only provide an indoor camera with standard packages and offer the option to purchase exterior cameras separately however time warner provides its customer with a rare level of flexibility by allowing them to select whether they would like an indoor or an outdoor security camera with their package the camera may be programmed to record at specific times and can be controlled and monitored online or via smartphone professional installation all time warner security systems are professionally installed so customers can be confident that their system will be set up correctly the bad time warner internet required high upfront costs expensive monthly monitoring mixed camera reviews time warner internet required in order to use time warner’s home security services customers must utilize the company’s internet services as well this can be a difficult expensive and inconvenient switch for those who are not currently customers of time warner high upfront costs time warner’s equipment is pretty pricey upfront costs start at  for the basic security package  for the security  video package and  for the security video  energy package if you’d like to purchase additional windowdoor sensors you’ll be paying  to  each expensive monthly monitoring time warner’s monthly monitoring rates are on the more expensive side as well monitoring prices start  per month which is double what some competing home security companies charge for comparable packages mixed camera reviews according to reviews we’ve received some customers have had problems with their time warner security cameras reported issues include cameras that do not work all of the time display only black and white footage malfunction in temperatures below  degrees and are not compatible with other home security systems the bottom line time warner cable’s home security service offers some great features including professional installations short contract lengths indoor and outdoor surveillance and stateoftheart equipment however upfront costs are high and monthly monitoring rates are expensive in comparison to many other top companies in the industry additionally time warner home security customers must also use time warner internet a requirement that can be costly and inconvenient for those who are not currently

own cameras that i can not take with me to other companys they take the monitoring screen back n they cameras are useless it was a complete waste of money on my part the prices are outragious you have to use spectrums wifi services for the system to work they trap you completely thank god we were smart n left them…your better off with dvr system every  days the data is lost it wont store footage so

people found this review helpful we’ve had twc now spectrum intelligent home for several years it as expensive to set up and nowadays there are better options for an intelligent home system the touch pad from spectrum is actually quite good and easy to use with lots of information the apps for your phonemobile device are also easy to set up and use the alarm system itself is adequate you can control the system from anywhere in the world where you have internet connection if someone is coming to your house you can give them a temporary code to get in and you will be notified by text when they arrive and when they depart the intelligent home thermostats are a different story they are old and clunky you cannot program them to turn on or off at specific times the maximum temperature for air conditioning is  degrees which is too hot if you’re home … but if your leaving for several days and want to keep the house at  to lower ac costs you’re out of luck we live in the desert where daytime highs are often in the  range furthermore the phone app only works occasionally when raising or lowering the temperature from a remote location or even within the home you’ll lower the temp from  to  when returning home only to arrive at home and discover it never changed even though the app says it did overall i would not get intelligent home from twcspectrum now several years ago when it first came out it was cutting edge but they have failed to keep up with the technology was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  rosalyn edmonds may th  chicago il  people found this review helpful all away around horrible cameras and a waste of money here’s to all burglars…the crappy nighttime image double image from window reflection not weather resistant for outside eve installation small viewing radius and intermittent video viewing will allow you to wipe out a house with little worries of identification i cannot even view my pet sitter or contractors come and go because of the long delay and delay in video while viewing remotely thank you twc for taking my  for cameras and making me feel as unprotected as if i had not installed tour crappy cameras at all even tour tech guys agree that they are laughable and won’t even use them in their own homes even this they’re free to them these were purchased  months ago and they’ve had no upgrades was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  tyler in texas may th  laredo tx  people found this review helpful an absolute nightmare stay away from them i finally get rid of this system tomorrow and this is after they were trying to add an additional month to contract luckily i had documentation of when installed system is just sorry and once i paid equipement off and expected to have a lower bill then spectrum raised my cable internet and phone rate along with dropping channels from lineup and i rarely can even get mbs download wired or wifi when paying for mbs this of course sends unintelligent home into a spin cameras don’t do what they claim all but useless also you make any changes to your other spectrum services you have to go through a special number to unintelligent home and they mess things up more often than not i can not say one good thing about spectrum or any of their services was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  melvin rice may th   people found this review helpful i have been very disappointed with the quality of service first of all their  monitoring is always going offline also as they note you must have their cable service since spectrum has taken over the price for everything has jumped almost  i decided to go with another security service and as i was

canceling my service for a company that actually values my business and has technology that actually works was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  louise april th  monrovia ca  people found this review helpful my home carried twc for nearly ten years and offered me a chance to upgrade service by getting security on twc as well i wasn’t under contract and would get a price break however there were  in hidden fees for yet another installation and then twc changed to spectrum and would not honor any of the agreements and the cable speed dropped while my bill that was promised to drop down to  for bundle that tripled at  per month and the speed was not being met i was told it was the rented modem and router and after spending several days trying to fix a cable guy came in and changed the gear and told me that i had extra boxes i didn’t need but am having to pay for so asked him to take back to reduce my rate he took the box but did not amend and i end up owing for that as well this is an unethical company most the time my security camera would not work because the system was down or the router was defective and i’m paying rent on all the gear and having to pay extra to make faster cable speed so as twc now spectrum did not honor end to provide service i brought all the gear back and terminated account yet intelligenthome hits my credit rating with false report of me owing an additional  for termination fee guys they stole an extra  from me each month after stealing  in gear and not providing quality service i ought to sue is what i ought to do in all this company has cost me a loss of  and false sense of security when system was never functional under intelligenthome look elsewhere you will have more money and better security without intelligenthome was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  pam overstreet april th  dallas tx  people found this review helpful tried to get additional

take heart and listen to the reviews you have been warned was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  matthew fultz march th  cleveland oh  people found this review helpful ive had intelligent home for  years now i have a feeling most people’s issues with it are lack of knowledge this system works perfectly fine no camera has ever gone offline as far as i can tell nor has any sensor one of the cameras are pointed at the driveway we have a big house so we use it to see whos home ive checked it at all hours during the day from work and night time when on vacation never an issue the system has a lot of customization for alerts you can set it to tell you the basics like when an alarm is tripped or when the power goes out or for more custom occurrences like if a certain door is opened after a certain time or if it isnt opened by a certain time great for knowing if kids leave in the middle of the night or if they dont come home from somewhere when planned my only issue has been with customer service for the alarm portion everyone gives you a different answer and certain account changes have to be made by ih support not twc normal customer service it was a bit bumpy in the beginning with what i as given with what i was promised after a few rough conversations they made it right its a shame to see they no longer offer new subscriptions ive spent  years talking this thing up and had a few people who are also very happy sign up the only other negative i think would be the upfront cost i spent almost  on equipment and additional sensors are  but can be found on amazon for  the door locks are another pain point ea and only from best buy but like any smart shopper i did my research before buying i knew what i was getting into was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  daniel db moreno march th   people found this review helpful note that time warner is now spectrum and the relationship that time warner had with intelligent home is not promoted or offer in their current portfolio of services and products that being said my experience was not positive and regret having done business with them not trustworthy or accommodating in any manner avoid this at all costs was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  brenda mcduffie

poor quality you will only be able to see what ever you need to see if the target does not move for  seconds on average i called time warner and their answer was that that is best their system can do

video image for intentional overnight damage to vehicle…the cameras were “offline” cameras had not been recording for two months i was told to check online status frequently after the first incident

daily really went to bed one night after checking and confirming online status by morning someone had intentionally moved things around on my porch by now the neighborhood must know that my cameras are not reliable i knew that i would catch it on  but no it went offline at am i hate twc their solution…” cancel the service” sure refund me something was this review helpful yes share get embed code

month to fix failed sensors customer service is not greatthey call you from the same number that an alarm is in progress call comes from if there is a problem with the equipment several times i have left work meetings because home security is calling and i think that my house was being robbed only to find that once again they were letting me know that i have a failed sensor the sensors should not fail as often as they do save your money and time and invest in a real home security system was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  judy martin january rd   people found this review helpful when this system was installed i was promised a  credit which i never received they did not install the thermostat so i had to hire an electrician and at the end of the lease they insisted that i return all of the equipment although they specifically told me in person that all the equipment was mine to keep shame on them for scamming an older lady breaking promises and illegal marketing was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  nia december st  creedmoor nc  people found this review helpful so after  months of
