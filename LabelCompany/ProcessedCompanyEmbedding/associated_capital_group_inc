associated capital group inc and its subsidiaries through which our operations are actually conducted the spinoff on november   gamco distributed all the outstanding shares of each class of common stock of ac group on a pro rata oneforone basis to the holders of each class of gamcos common stock prior to the distribution gamco contributed the  interest it held in gabelli  company investment advisers inc gcia fka gabelli securities inc and certain cash and other assets to ac group during the twelve months ended december   ac purchased the  of gcia shares owned by third parties and certain employees in exchange for  shares of the company gcia is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ac in addition the following transactions were also undertaken in connection with the spinoff gamco issued a promissory note the gamco note to ac group in the original principal amount of  million used to partially capitalize the company in connection with the spinoff the gamco note bears interest at  per annum and has a maturity date of november   with respect to the original principal amount of the gamco note interest on the gamco note will accrue from the most recent date for which interest has been paid or if no interest has been paid from the effective date of the gamco note provided however that at the election of gamco payment of interest on the gamco note may in lieu of being paid in cash be paid in whole or in part in kind on the thenoutstanding principal amount a pik amount gamco will repay all pik amounts added to the outstanding principal amount of the gamco note in cash on the fifth anniversary of the date on which each such pik amount was added to the outstanding principal amount of the gamco note in no event may any interest be paid in kind subsequent to november   gamco may prepay the gamco note prior to maturity without penalty during the year ended december   ac received principal repayments totaling  million on the gamco note  million of the prepayment was applied

contributed by gamco to ac and gcia became a majorityowned subsidiary of ac on november   in connection with the completion of the spinoff the gcia note is thus now an intercompany note within the ac group factors affecting financial condition and results of operations except for the one month period subsequent to the spinoff the companys combined statements of income for the three months ended december   and the companys combined consolidated statements of income for the twelve months ended december   were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of gamco as the company was not a standalone public company prior to the spinoff the combined consolidated statement of income for the period ended december   includes allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by gamco and not historically recorded at the business unit level these expenses were allocated on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a prorata basis of headcount or other measures management believes the assumptions underlying the combined consolidated financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses are reasonable nevertheless the combined consolidated financial statement may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the company and may not reflect its combined results of operations financial position and cash flows had it been a separate standalone company during the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if the company had been a separate standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure references within these notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and the combined consolidated statements

organizational chart during the second quarter of  we negotiated to exchange ac shares for gcia shares from the minority investors in gcia ac increased its interest in gcia by  in return for  shares

institutional services holdings llc a newly formed delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ac as of december   as of january   image removed overview consolidated statements of income investment advisory and incentive fees which are based on the amount and composition of aum in our funds and accounts represent our largest source of revenues growth in revenues depends on good investment performance which influences the value of existing aum as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels growth in aum is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels which is usually based on several factors including performance and service incentive fees generally consist of an incentive allocation on the absolute gain in a portfolio or a fee of  of the economic profit as defined in the agreements governing the investment vehicle we recognize revenue only when the measurement period has been completed or at the time of an investor redemption institutional research services revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis or direct payments on behalf of institutional clients commission revenues vary directly with the perceived value of the research as well as account trading activity and new account generation compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers portfolio managers sales trading research and all other professional staff variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents  of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs management fee is incentivebased and entirely variable compensation in the amount of  of the aggregate pretax profits which is paid to mr gabelli or his designee for acting as executive chairman pursuant to his employment agreement so long as he is an executive of ac other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs and clearing charges and fees incurred by the brokerage business other income and expenses include net gains and losses from investments which include both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities and equity in earnings of investments in partnerships interest and dividend income and interest expense net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders as reported on a separate company basis of our consolidated majorityowned subsidiaries and net income attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate please refer to notes a and d in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report consolidated statements of financial condition we ended the  year with approximately  million in cash and investments net of securities sold not yet purchased of  million this includes  million of cash and short term us treasuries  million of securities net including  million shares of gamco stock and  million invested in affiliated and third party funds and partnerships our financial resources underpin our flexibility to pursue strategic objectives that may include acquisitions liftouts seeding new investment strategies and coinvesting as well as shareholder compensation in the form of share repurchase and dividends total shareholders equity was  million or  per share on december   compared to  million or  per share on december   note that these shareholders equity per share calculations are a nongaap measurement the increase in equity from the end of  was largely comprised of an increase in cash and cash equivalents of  million an increase in investments in securities net and affiliated and third party funds of  million a reduction of  million in liabilities partially offset by a reduction in receivables of  million the company also reviews an analysis of adjusted economic book value aebv and aebv per share a nongaap financial measure that management believes is useful for analyzing acs financial condition because it reflects the impact on book value if and when the gamco note is paid down the gamco note that was issued as part of the spinoff transaction is not treated as an asset for gaap purposes but as a reduction in equity and will continue to be reflected as a reduction in equity in future periods in the amount of the principal then outstanding as the gamco note pays down the companys total equity will increase and once the gamco note is fully paid off by gamco the companys total equity and aebv will be the same at december   aebv for the company was  million and the aebv per share was  per share the reconciliation of gaap book value and gaap book value per share to aebv and aebv per share at december   is shown below in thousands except for per share data reconciliation of total equity to adjusted economic book value total per share total equity as reported     add gamco note   adjusted economic book value     our primary goal is to use our liquid resources to opportunistically and strategically grow book value and net income while this goal is a priority if opportunities are not present with what we consider a margin of safety we will consider
