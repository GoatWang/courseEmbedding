provide a more detailed review of our financials before i share with you our goals for fiscal  teresa steve and i will then take your questions when i assumed the role as aerovironments chief executive officer a little more than a year ago i was confident we were well positioned to execute our strategy successfully drive value for shareholders and provide our customers more actionable intelligence so they can proceed with certainty to troops on the front line that certainty can mean the difference between life and death to businesses it can mean helping to ensure their financial prosperity our core business is strong with leading market positions and the ability to generate attractive returns and our growth portfolio is compelling with the highly differentiated solutions weve been developing for launch into large new global market opportunities achieving these opportunities requires planning when we developed our fiscal  plan customer order timing resulted in a heavily weighted fiscal fourth quarter thanks to the support and dedication of our amazing team we delivered record fourth quarter results as follows revenue of  million an increase of  yearoveryear operating income of  million an increase of nearly  yearoveryear and fully diluted earnings per share of  an increase of more than  from the prior year our outstanding fourth quarter performance combined with careful operating expense management throughout the year produced full year revenue of  million a small increase over fiscal  and fully diluted earnings per share of    well above our guidance and a  increase yearoveryear gross margin decrease partly the result of our onetime reserve reversal in fiscal  and partly due to higher sustaining expenses our focus on operating expense management more than offset low gross margin to produce operating income of  million a  increase over last year our expense management included reducing internal rd investments from  of revenue in fiscal  to  of revenue in fiscal  as we consistently communicated to you throughout the year in addition to our financial performance we achieved nearly all of the objectives for fiscal  that we shared with you a year ago and we emerged even better positioned for long term value creation than before at the beginning of fiscal  i shared with you our  key milestones for the year which i will now report on we continued the expansion of our domestic small uas business through sustainment and upgrades deliveries that support potential us army procurement programs and promising us navy adoption we began shipments of mantis i sensors to dod customers for puma ae upgrades at the end of fiscal  the i sensors suite delivers unparalleled imaging capabilities for small uas and has the potential to drive its own significant upgrade cycle among puma ae customers we also improved our positioning for us army soldier born sensor competition with our next generation pocketable snipe unmanned aircraft system including completing shipment of our first  systems for customer evaluation and we continue to demonstrate effective small uas capabilities aboard naval vessels to drive further navel adoption of our solutions we extended out international small uas installed base with existing and new customers small uas constitutes the majority of air environments international revenue which grew from  to  of company revenue in fiscal  or from about  million to nearly  million we offered a comprehensive solution that appeals to our international customers and they are procuring one or more products from our family of small uas as well as multiyear services such as training and repairs some of these customers are even using our systems  relying heavily on them to protect their forces and pushing the extreme capabilities of our unmanned solutions aerovironment is without question helping these customers proceed with certainty with very high stakes on the line this integrated family of systems has helped to score increased adoption across a broader geographic range from western to eastern europe from the middle east to asia and oceana expanding our list of allied customers to more than  countries new uas customers in fiscal  included indiscernible and three other nato and middle east countries as an example of family of systems adoption in october we announced a  million contract with the netherlands for digital upgrades to their existing raven fleet and for new wasp ae and puma ae systems on june st we announced that the australian defense force selected our wasp ae for small uas program we anticipate more multiyear contracts from international customers ahead as our installed base grows and we create more opportunities to build recurring revenue streams from sustainment services and upgrades we continued to progress toward the us dod frequency relocation program for small uas winning an initial contract that we believe positions us well for follow on work expected this fiscal year the strategic investments we have been making to build our tms business continue to deliver results in fiscal  our tms revenue was about  million growing to more than  million in fiscal  in fiscal  tms revenue grew to more than  million an increase of more than  over the previous year from fiscal  this represents a compound annual growth rate of  as you can see the returns on our strategic incremental tms investments of previous years are very positive tms now accounts for  of total company revenue we continue to build our family of tactical missile systems to address the important needs of a growing number of customers and we continue to successfully deliver switchblade systems to our us government customers in october we announced a  million contract from the us army for switchblade systems which strengthens our position as the leader in loitering munitions one type of the tactical missile systems in fiscal  we deployed blackwing systems for use on navy submarines with very positive results an encouraging milestone on the path towards longterm adoption into a navy program of record still within our tms business progress continued on our multiple switchblade variance including production and delivery of one variant  technical difficulty operator operator instructions you may resume steven gitlin thank you very much this is steve gitlin and we again we apologize for whatever technical issues cut our call off so wahid is going to start a little bit earlier in the script apologies if there is some repetition here but we want to make sure that youre tracking with his prepared comments wahid nawabi thank you steve we continue to progress towards the us view of this frequency relocation program for small uas winning an initial contract that we believe positions us well for follow on work expected this fiscal year the strategic investments weve been making to build our tms business continue to deliver results in fiscal  our tms revenue was about  million growing to more than  million in fiscal  in fiscal  tms revenue grew to more than  million an increase of more than  over the previous year from fiscal  this represents a compound annual growth rate of  as you can see the returns on our strategic incremental tms investments of previous years are very positive tms now accounts for  of total company revenue we continue to build out our family of tactical missile systems to address the important needs of a growing number of customers and we continue to successfully deliver switchblade systems to our us government customers in october we announced a  million contract from the us army for switchblade systems which strengthens our position as the leader in loitering munitions one type of tactical missile system in fiscal  we deployed blackwing systems for use on navy submarines with very positive results an encouraging milestone on the path toward long term adoption into a navy program of record still within our tms business progress continued on our multiple switchblade variants including production and delivery of one variant and further development of others nearly half of our fiscal  tms revenue comes in the form of customer funded research and development while customer funded rd is usually lower margin business structured and costs plus contracts it’s also a strong indicator of customer engagement that generally leads to higher margin product revenue in subsequent years additionally we are demonstrating effective counter uaf capabilities that have the potential to protect troops from the growing threat of lethal drones operated by our adversaries in our commercial information solutions business we unveiled our innovative quantix drone an av decision support system analytics platform shared news about important and relevant research with fresno state university and made continued progress with early adopter customers and multiple industries in april we performed an important demonstration with legado networks dominion virginia power and virginia tech during this event we flew our puma ae system up to  miles away from its operator along power lines using legados satellite and terrestrial capabilities to maintain communication and control this demonstration illustrated a safe and effective approach to controlling drones and beyond visual line of sight operation this type of capability will be critical towards maximizing the economic benefits of drones in commercial applications additionally we achieved further engagement with potential customers for atmospheric satellite systems in our ees business we grew revenue by  year over year and accelerated our global ev charging strategy by winning a contract with volvo to support their plugin vehicle rollout in europe and china which we announced in march we continue to enjoy strong demand and growth for ev test systems from global oems and battery manufacturers particularly in china north america and south korea our passenger ev charging solutions enjoyed strong unit growth in  and we surpassed  level two charging systems deployed shipments of evses increased sharply over last year as we supported the launch of the chevrolet bolt ev outside of north america our multiyear program with volvo to develop a residential charger for the european chinese and north america markets is in progress building on our next generation ev charging systems architecture and is compatible with  global standards and agency requirements also in fiscal  our evsers system was integrated with emotorwerks juicenet for two utility programs this development added to our broad portfolio of network integrated charging solutions that demonstrate our adaptability to the evolving ev charging network ecosystem for demand response and vehicletogrid applications finally in ees we began shipping turbocord level two chargers to a major global german automaker we made good progress on our continued improvement initiatives enhancing business processes quality our organization planning and execution these initiatives have already delivered high customer and employee satisfaction which ultimately contribute to shareholder value across our business we achieved our goals in fiscal  and improved our positioning to achieve our longterm growth objectives now i will turn the call over to teresa to provide more detail on our

increase in inventory dollars was primarily due to an anticipated first half shipment turning to capital expenditures in the fiscal year  we invested approximately  million or  of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment and recognized  million of depreciation and amortization expense now an update to our fiscal  visibility as of today we have q ending backlog that we expect to execute in fiscal  of  million quarter to date bookings that we anticipate to execute in fiscal  of  million unfunded backlog from incrementally funded contracts that we anticipate to recognize revenue during the balance of the year are  million revenues needed to hold ees revenues flat relative to last year up  million this adds up to  million  at the midpoint of revenue guidance now id like to turn things back to wahid to discuss areovironments expectations for fiscal year  wahid nawabi thanks teresa now i would like to provide a macro view on our industry industry trends are favorable for our  in fiscal  first the global threat environment remains very dynamic requiring highly capable small military teams that can operate flexibly and effectively in a wide variety of theaters around the globe in this environment organic intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and precision strike solutions like our small uas and tms offer game changing capabilities that help troops obtain the actionable intelligence they need to act decisively and proceed with certainty because us forces are not operating alone in these theaters demand from our allies for aerovironment solutions remained strong as well second the federal government fiscal year  budget request includes procurement line items associated with aerovironment solutions the budget request includes approximately  million for the us army navy marine corp us socomm and for the first time coast guard and customs and border patrol programs seeking aerovironments small uas or tactical missile systems third our international footprint continues to grow with an increasing number of new international customers we now count more than  countries outside of the us as customers for a family of small uas similarly our family of tactical missile systems footprint among us customers continues to advance with strong pulls from the unique and game changing capabilities these systems offer and the highly dynamic threat environment in our dod small uas market we see incremental opportunities and upgrades the soldier borne sensor or sbs program in frequency relocation combined with growing international demand for our family of small uas we see healthy opportunities for us in this core part of our business as for our growth portfolio in tms switchblade and its variants not only represent our second largest business but also continue to improve our positioning for an annual domestic opportunity that we estimate exceeds  billion in value in cis were poised to make the next step in our plan to enter that what could be a multibillion dollar global market opportunity looking ahead were focused on building on our  success and accomplishing  objectives which i will now outline first increasing our small uas footprint in domestic and international markets continuing strong multiyear international revenue momentum winning the us army sbs program should a competition and award take place this year achieving further progress in our us governments frequency relocation program and demonstrating progress with other us government customers such as the coast guard and dhs second continuing to grow our tms business while increasing its contribution to funded backlog and continuing adoption momentum of switchblade variants third achieving the next major milestone in our cis business plan this calendar year which includes shipment of initial quantix drone and decision support system subscriptions to customers in agriculture were taking a gated approach that includes evaluating adoption to inform each subsequent phase of how we build this potentially large business fourth continuing to grow our ev charging business domestically and globally through relationships with automakers while maintaining our leadership in industrial ev charging and ev test systems and fifth successfully deploying our key fiscal  strategic internal initiatives which include our people strategy and our business process improvement program to further position aerovironment for long term growth and value creation now i will share our view of fiscal  as teresa described moments ago our total visibility for fiscal  is now  the same as this time last year given our visibility the strong performance our team our planning and forecasting based on customer demand signals favorable macro factors and our strong position we expect revenue to grow to between  million and  million this year we expect the mix of revenue meaning the blend of higher margin product revenue and fixed priced contract versus lower margin services revenue in cost plus contracts to result in lower gross margin this year than last year we plan to spend between  and  of revenue on internal research and development investments in fiscal  and we expect a significantly higher tax rate than last year we anticipate the net impact of revenue mix spending and taxes will produce fully diluted earnings per share between  and  we expect lower seasonality in our results than last year with first half revenue representing about  of our full year we anticipate revenue in our first quarter historically the lowest of each fiscal year of between  million and  million which fully diluted loss per share of between  and  before we move to qa i would like to reemphasize the main point of todays call first our business remains strong and profitable and our team achieved or exceeded our financial objectives for fiscal  second we achieved good progress on our fiscal  milestones that maintained the leading market position in our core business and advanced our differentiated solutions for large and new global opportunities and our growth portfolio and third we remain on track for long term value creation i would also like to remind you that aerovironment continues to maintain a strong position in the most exciting categories of the defense market with profitable businesses and strong growth prospects our strategic growth opportunities such as our commercial businesses offered the ability to capitalize on additional multibillion dollar market opportunities and our strong balance sheet gives us the important ability to move quickly to seize new markets when opportunities emerge thank you to the aerovironment team for your outstanding efforts in fiscal  and for your relentless dedication to supporting our customers thank you to our customers who continue to make aerovironment their preferred choice and thank you to our shareholders for your continued interest and confidence in us now teresa steve and i will take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of joseph de nardi with stifel your line is now open joseph de nardi wahid i think you mentioned seeing some renewed interest in global observer i guess in the quarter im wondering if you could just talk about that a little bit more in detail wahid nawabi as we have said before aerovironment remains to be a leader in that particular area of capability with a very strong demonstrated track record over two decades of successes and programs that we have executed on and as we said from approximately three years ago that we have been engaged  to my knowledge at least engaged with various interested of customers both in the defense as well as the commercial markets for potential adoption and contracts for such capability and we  although the investment level is there fairly low but we are still engaging and we continue to be engaged with customer  of interested customers for that capability weve also said in the past and i repeat that that represents a very large opportunity which remain so far to be essentially a zero for us in terms of capitalizing on that and making it to a real business and however should that odds change or that situation change it does represent a very large opportunity for aerovironment and aerovironment offers a very compelling differentiated capability than anyone else in the world in that front and as we have more progress and engagements with the customers that are significant we will keep you abreast and informed joseph de nardi okay but should i understand the comment that you made to suggest that you did see that in the quarter you have seen some renewed interest there or no wahid nawabi all ive said is that we continue to be enraged with various customers who have an interest in that capability i have not said whether we have been engaged more or less than before its been an ongoing activity and effort for us a very small very small insignificant investment but still a small investment to pursue those opportunities that have a serious what i call qualify potential customers that could turn into an adoption eventually but so far there is nothing new to report operator thank you our next question comes from the line of greg konrad with jefferies your line is now open greg konrad i just wanted to touch on lmams kind of where that program stands if you look at the half mark ph they are obviously very supportive and you saw a nice markup there and maybe some of the milestones for that program or what type of feedback you are getting from the customer wahid nawabi yes sure so you are absolutely correct that the government budgeting process and the hapc or hapc ph i think its referred to as had a favorable indicator for the procurement of those solutions and budgeting for that through the congressional budget approval process again that remains to be just  again it goes  going through the process by itself right now there is a specific line item on the armys oco or overseas contingency operations line item for missile procurement of lmams and its essentially its  i believe its line  on the actual budget line and it represents roughly  million worked up appropriation now keep in mind that that does not mean that actual dollars are completely approved or funded its a request that has been made by the presidents budget request or submittal and it has to go through the approval process as it always does what i can tell you is that as you saw from our results in fiscal  in the fourth quarter we remain fairly enthusiastic and excited about the prospects of our tactical missile systems product portfolio we are positioned very well because we have delivered very successfully in the past on multiple such opportunities one of which that i mentioned earlier in the call in fiscal  the customer seems to really appreciate and prefer aerovironments capability and offering and as i mentioned on my earlier remarks also the macro threat environment is such that i believe we are an exciting category of the defense as well as in a very exciting subcategory of uavs or drones which is a loitering munitions which switchblade offers steven gitlin and one thing to add greg this is steve is that lmams refers to a specific program for the army that were currently addressing with the product that we call switchblade which is the first the initial but only one of  one element of our emerging family of tactical missile systems that are now addressing a broad range of customers opportunities and potential market value so progress on lmams progress with our switchblade product but also as you can see from the results in the year on significant progress across the breath of our portfolio and tactical missile systems contributing to that  cagr from  and revenue associated with that part of our business greg konrad thank you and then just i wanted to touch on working capital i think you mentioned in the script that there was some buildup of inventory to meet first half shipment should we expect to see working capital come down as we kind of move through  or is this kind of the appropriate level teresa covington so greg this is teresa in my prepared remarks i talked that inventory although down from the third quarter ending the year at  million was above the prior year i mentioned that yes some of that is related to shipments that we expect in the first half of fiscal  we do from timetotime on a casebycase basis we will increase our inventory level to respond quickly to an international small uas customer or a key domestic customer that we believe gives us ability to win business and has proven effective for us but thats on a casebycase basis also our accounts receivable including our unbilled it was up  million at the end of  versus  that is a result of just the high revenue in q no change in terms of our dso or collections operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of peter armand with baird your line is now open peter armand wahid on the guidance for revenues the  million to  million wondering if you could just clarify why the kind of expectation you have a lower margin mix it seems like tms is really ramping international is really ramping would seem that would be that might potential have some additional favorable margins wahid nawabi peter great question as i mentioned on my remarks so we do expect the gross margin percentage for the year fiscal  to be slightly lower than fiscal  and theres actually two factors related to  three things or factors that make up the gross margin percentage and the product category first one is the different products such as one version of the raven versus a different version of the raven have different profitability profiles so different product mix by itself has a different profile number two is variations between product sales and services sale as you could see from our tactical missile systems business for example that we generated a significant amount of revenue from customer funded rmv programs or engineering services type programs or projects and those tend to be slightly lower margin than just selling products as a product revenue and then third the type of contracts that we actually engage with customers or we deliver products to or services to customers also have a different profile of probability for example products that we sell at firm fixed price contracts tend to generally have slightly higher risk but also a higher profit for the company primarily because we invest money to sell those  to make those products and then we sell them as a fixed price contract on the other hand cost plus contracts relatively speaking has a slightly lower gross margin and profitability profile due to the fact that has lower risk but also you know lower profiting profile so based on those three main factors of types of mix that changes in the product we expect the gross margins in fiscal  to be lower and that usually changes every year to some degree or another but thats what the profile looks like for fiscal  right now peter armand got it and just one followup on tms the growth has been exponential and  million i guess in revenue was i think the number you quoted for fiscal  at what point does this business start to acquire significantly more capex going forward wahid nawabi another great question peter so we have been obviously very enthusiastic and bullish on our tactical missile systems for a while if you recall about three years ago one of our strategic growth initiatives where we communicated to our shareholders that were going to invest incrementally above and beyond our historical levels was a tactical missile systems business and while we could not share the specific details of how much and to what product we were fairly confident that the investments were going to payoff dividend and theyve done so as you could see from the results from the past few years and fiscal  revenues were close to  million versus about  million or  million in fiscal  so that family of products  and so in addition to that we now have multiple variants of the products as i said for different customer needs and different mission profiles and different applications and all that means were pursuing a few potential programs of records as well as i mentioned so all of that means that when there is a program of record or theres more customer demand for or buying signals for those products we will have to invest in ramping up manufacturing and building additional production capacity and part of the investments that we made in last fiscal year was actually to expand and upgrade that capability to build the worlds best what i call tactical missile systems or loitering munitions manufacturing capability in the world and so were on track with that and well make the investments as we see them judiciously and prudently operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of troy jensen with piper jaffray your line is now open nick johnson thanks for taking my call its actually nick johnson on for troy congrats first of all on the strong quarter i wanted to ask on the news of your contract with the australian defense force and your comments on future expansion with international customers would you guys expect these future contracts with the new countries be substantial in size similar to one with australia additionally do you further expect to expand your fleet with your current international customers wahid nawabi so nick good afternoon and as you also saw from our previous  my previous or earlier comments the international small uas category of our business has been very strong in the last few years and ive said this many times in the past which is the adoption cycle and phase which most of our international customers on aggregate are at is about five to  years behind our domestic us dod customer adoption curve and the number of countries im pleased to inform  obviously announce that weve achieved over  countries its a very reputable list of countries around multiple continents and multiple geographies so that all bodes really well for the strength and the customers desire and pull for our solutions and our differentiated capabilities every country is somewhat different and unique in its profile of need as well as the adoption curve so specific to your question we have a mix of all we have a mix of some customers that are fairly advanced in their adoption curve such as the announcement with the netherlands customers we see the contracts that i mentioned in my call for multimillions of dollars and it was primarily an upgrade and extension of our line versus other customers that are just initiating initial buy or the australian case where they had evaluated our products and now they are actually proceeding with a program of record for the wasp ae family of systems so in general we expect that to grow and continue to be strong throughout this year and in coming year and we are very delighted about our position and pleased with the results that weve achieved so far operator operator instructions and we have a follow up question from the line of joseph de nardi with stifel your line is now open joseph de nardi wahid thanks for the additional color on tms in terms of disclosing the revenue if you look at uas excluding the growth from tms revenues were down there does that  the remainder of the uas business starts to stabilize in fy  is that your expectation wahid nawabi great question joe and you welcome about the comment earlier so here is how i view this in general peter  joe first and foremost since our product portfolio has grown over the last few years significantly we now have different customers and different markets and geographies and different applications with various degrees or different stages of their adoption in life cycle i would characterize the domestic small uas customer base the most what i call advanced or ahead of the adoption curve where they are in a sustainment and upgrade mode i referred to those terminologies internally so i hope you can understand my rational behind that and what i mean by that is that we have a very large installed base they are very comfortable with our products they see the value in our products and primarily they are buying upgrades and sustainment spare parts and logistic services for the products in those cases for example the i which we announced and shift a significant number of them in fourth quarter was one example of that upgrade opportunity within our domestic us customer base in addition to that we are also launching new products and introducing products such as the example of the snipe uav that i mentioned that we delivered  systems in the fourth quarter and that’s geared towards the new program of potential program of record calls sbs of soldier board sensor program and so that represents a new growth opportunity additionally we are pursuing new customers for existing and new products and i mentioned in my  on the call earlier that we are pursuing adoption and we made progress with the us navy and also their line items in the budget for department of homeland security or customs and border petrol as well as us coast guards these are customers that we have been pursuing and engaged with for a while and they are now starting to come online or do procurements and budget for these capabilities which i expect in the long run to pay fairly strong dividend for us in general so i don’t feel as its down i view that its going through a different cycle of its phase and it has growth opportunities within itself but also upgraded new products sales to new and existing customers joseph de nardi okay and then i guess just on tms can you just talk about to the extent you can how big that business can get in terms of the way it seems deployed now is it being used more broadly than you had expected i mean just any color on what you are expectations are for that family of products wahid nawabi sure so joe a long time ago we decided to really provide specific guidance in terms of the exact size of these market except to refer to third party data what we have shared in the tactical missile systems category for example specifically the original switchblade that the addressable market which switchblades  the original switchblade can and does provide a more compelling value preposition that can replace or displace represents roughly about  billion worth of annual spend in the us dod budgets for line items alone and so again thats just a general rough estimate of the size of that potential market opportunity for the original switchblade and as i mentioned we have more than one variant of our original switchblade one variant of which weve been able to disclose with you in more detail which was the blackwing product and that is a submarine launched uav nonlethal that essentially gives the submarine visual lineofsight beyond the periscope and it allows it to communicate multidomain platforms through to a ship airplane satellite and submarines and uuvs so that portfolio is growing the customer interest in that product line is strong and fairly healthy and also our execution and our value preposition seems to be resonating with the customer base and very compelling and differentiatable operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of martin miller ph a private investor your line is now open unidentified analyst i apologize in advance if this subject has been covered because i was disconnected for a shorttime as follows in the last reporting period i recall that we were told that the company was essentially debt free i might not be using the phrase correctly but im wondering if that has changed materially or thank you wahid nawabi thank you martin this is wahid we have  were fairly in a good position in terms of our balance sheet you are fairly accurate on your conclusion that the company doesn’t carry much debt so we have lines of credits but we don’t really don’t really carry much debt at all in our balance sheet and we do have a strong cash position on the balance sheet primarily the board looks at that on a very regular basis we as a management team review that very regularly and there are many reasons as to why we have that position that we have based on our strategy and our business profile unidentified analyst alright thank you and may i have the second question again i apologize in advance if covered already and im wondering if our team is addressing with the government regulators the issues of altitude and distance on air traffic and the like and are we making progress are we being joined by other interested manufacturers thank you wahid nawabi sure martin this is wahid again so we enjoy a very good and positive working relationship with various regulatory agencies in the national airspace primarily the faa weve had a relationship with faa for a very long time and i characterize it as a very cooperative productive and successful healthy relationship there are number of different activities that were involved with and engage with faa and the industry partners and the commercial rules and regulatory requirements around the use of drones and uavs in the national airspace for commercial applications there are multiple different projects and well be glad to share that with you in more detail later at a separate time if you like but we are involved in that and we are aware of the fact that would play a significant role in the long run in terms of the adoption of uavs for the commercial airspace one example that i shared on the  on my comments earlier was the demonstration that we made with dominion virginia power and virginia tech with a strategic industry partner called ligado and what we did is we flew our puma uavs approximately  miles away from the site where it was launched along power lines and we transferred communication and control of the uav to a satellite and terrestrial system provided by the legado networks which essentially demonstrated the capability of operating beyond visual line of sight and that is a significant demonstration in my opinion in terms of demonstrating the ability that we can operate these uavs safely and successfully well beyond the visual line of sight in the national airspace for commercial applications and we did that earlier this summer this year and i consider it as one example of such engagements that we have with the industry and various government agencies steven gitlin and one note to add to that if i may our products unlike many others in the  who are entering the market have been used for decades regularly around the world in some of the most inhospitable environments and beyond visual line of sight missions and application so we design our products to perform effectively safely and reliably in a wide variety of applications including beyond visual line of sight and as wahid mentioned were actively engaged domestically and are eager to help lead the way into a future where safe effective and reliable beyond visual line of sight drone operations take place operator thank you and we have a follow up question from the line of peter armand with baird your line is now open peter armand just a quick housekeeping one you mentioned the higher tax rate for fiscal  teresa is there any sort of expected range that youre looking at teresa covington yes peter i did not include and we didnt provide guidance on the range we are expecting it to be higher historically with higher pretax income aerovironments tax range has been in the  to  range operator thank you and im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to mr steven gitlin for any closing remarks steven gitlin thank you chelsey we do

third quarter performance exceeded our expectations second high third quarter funded backlog of  million demonstrates continued strong customer demand for innovative solutions and third we anticipate growth this year and tactical missile systems and international small uas and we’re excited about the availability of our commercial information solutions later this calendar year on today’s call i’ll review our third quarter financial performance and then provide an update on the progress we’re making to achieve our fiscal  objectives teresa covington aerovironment cfo will then provide a detailed financial review before i discuss our outlook for the year and confidence in our longterm potential for value creation following our prepared remarks teresa steve and i will take a questions now a quick summary of third quarter financial performance during the quarter we continue to execute our strategy successfully and achieve our objectives importantly continued strength and bookings an indicator of robust customer demand for innovative solutions produced our third highest scorer funded backlog ever of  million this backlog combined with yeartodate revenue and bookings this quarter provides us with  visibility into the midpoint of our full year guidance which teresa will discuss in more detail shortly third quarter revenue up  million was above the high end of the range i previewed last quarter and loss per share of  was significantly more favorable than our expectations two factors contributed to the loss first revenue was lower than our breakeven run rate second similar to our first and second quarter this year plan increases and sustaining engineering reduced gross margins compared to levels from last year the loss was smaller than we expected mainly due to higher than expected revenue favorable revenue mix and lower spending now let’s quickly review progress and the quarter again some of the milestones i identified at the beginning of this fiscal year our core business with the us department of defense for group  uas remains strong with the largest unit share by far of the total unmanned aircraft fleet and a successful track record of winning more than  of the competitive task order dollars issued under the army’s latest small uas program since exception in  we continue to provide new small uas to customers to meet their stated requirements and deliver replacements when systems reach the end of their operational lives and uas we also deliver sustainment support through spare parts and provide options for our customers to upgrade their products in order to serve their needs better our i sensor suite significantly improve situational awareness through superior optical capabilities the i is an upgrade to our puma ae system that represents a healthy opportunity for us and reflects the value of continuous innovation to creating new capability for customers as a point of reference when we introduced the gimbal sensor upgrade several years ago our us dod customers procured it to upgrade their existing raven b fleets we recently submitted our proposal to the army for the frequency relocation program which requires that all small uas be modified to operate on a new segment of the frequency spectrum this spectrum ship is due to the fact that the federal government sold the frequency currently used by small uas to commercial firms we will provide an update on this opportunity as we learn more indicative of new opportunities within the us dod we expect to deliver  next generation snipe nano unmanned aircraft systems to a domestic customer for evaluation soon the army soldier borne sensors or sbs program calls for pocketable uavs that frontline troops can quickly deploy to gain situational awareness within their immediate surroundings we also continue to work with the us navy to pursue deployment of puma ae systems on a larger number of their vessels given our strong customer relationships and innovative solutions we believe we are wellpositioned to build on these opportunities to drive value for our stockholders after a strong first generation small uas procurement cycle from the early s to early  the us dod market has transitioned into a sustainment and upgrade phase for those systems while we continue to refine and advance new second generation capabilities and contract the international market is in the initial stage of adoption for first generation small uas during our third quarter we continue to see strong international demand for a small uas contributing to our robust funded backlog and representing a significant portion of our expected high fourth quarter revenue turning back to the us government market our tactical missile systems business which has grown into a significant contributor to our results remained a strategic longterm growth opportunity we believe the market opportunity for tactical missile systems represents more than  billion based on annual dod expenditures for legacy weapon systems we believe tms family of systems offers the fundamentally superior in more cost effective solutions than the legacy systems employed today and which we expect to displays for an array of missions tms remains focused on us government customers and continues to grow the direct result of straight strategic investments we made and prior years that have – and will continue to benefit our results within tms we continue to produce switchblade systems for dismounted infantry force protection and focus on improving this product for a pending army program a record for lethal miniature aerial missile systems or lmams we continue to work with the us navy to position blackwing our submarine launched intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance or isr solution broad adoption through deployment development and evaluation of the four additional switchblade variants we have discussed previously one is in production and three are in various stages of development testing and evaluation much of it with customer funding we expect tms revenue to grow significantly from fiscal  and believe there are compelling opportunities for additional growth in the years ahead another area of strategic investment is our commercial information solutions business or cis based on third party market assessments we see a global market valued in the billions of dollars for drone based commercial solutions cis offers three differentiated solutions to commercial customers first our unique quantix drone enables our customers to automatically map and scan more than  acres in  minutes using both color and multispectral sensors all at the push of a button second our decision support system processes scanned imagery and automatically produces descriptive analytics and historical comparisons and third our turnkey flight services support customers who choose not to own or operate drones part of what differentiates our valuable offering is it ease of views high degree of integration and its professional grade design for example if the customer knows how to use the tablet device then they can operate our quantix drone which plant its own flight path based on a user defined mapping area then launches scans the area and lands itself right where it launched from our av dss processes the data from quantix and then performs a number of automated operations that include anomaly detection and canopy coverage analysis for growers we continue to work with early adopter customers in agriculture energy utilities and transportation to test and validate our solution and this process is generating strong interest as we prepare for production and delivery later this calendar year moving to another opportunity area we remain engaged with potential customers for our atmospheric satellite capabilities we will inform you should we achieve meaningful results in our discussions and our ees segment which consist ev test system ev solutions and industrial ev charging systems – quarterly revenue increased by more than  yearoveryear we experienced strong demand for ev test systems from global automakers and battery manufacturers in north america and asia and our ev solutions product line we began shipping our level  home chargers to meet larger than forecasted initial demand driven by the chevy bolt ev launched in an additional north america oem program in january we surpassed  level  chargers deployed our posicharge industrial charger shipments picked up with several deployments of our new procore line introduced earlier this year we also benefited from continued demand for our ground support equipment charging systems at several airports during the quarter before turning to our financial results i’d like to welcome teresa covington to her new position as chief financial officer teresa most recently served as our vice president of finance responsible for ees finance and managing corporate planning and treasury functions

the first three quarters of fiscal  the increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower gross margins of  million partially offset by decrease in sga expense of  million and rd expense of  million the effective income tax benefit rate for the nine months ended january   was  compared to the effective income tax benefit rate from the prior year of  for the nine months ended january   the net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal  with  million or  loss per share compared to net income of  million or  earnings per share for the nine months ended january   our funded backlog as of january   with  million an increase of  million or  from the third quarter of fiscal year  and an increase of  million or  from the second quarter of fiscal  turning to our balance sheet cash cash equivalents and investments at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  totaled  million a decrease of  million from the prior quarter the decrease in cash cash equivalents and investments was driven by higher working capital requirements of the business accounts receivable including unbilled and retention receivables at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  totaled  million a decrease of  million from the prior quarter total days sales outstanding was approximately  days compared to  days at the end of the prior quarter net inventory at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  was  million compared to  million at the end of the prior quarter days and inventory were approximately  days compared to  days at the end of the prior quarter this increase in days and inventory was primarily due to an increase in inventory for anticipated fourth quarter shipments turning to capital expenditures in the third quarter of fiscal  we invested approximately  million or  of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment and recognized  million of depreciation and amortization expense now an update to our fiscal  visibility as of today we have yeartodate q revenues of  million q ending backlog that we expect to execute in fiscal  of an additional  million q quartertodate bookings that we anticipate to execute in fiscal  of an additional  million no unfunded backlog from incrementally funded contracts that we anticipate to recognize revenue during the balance of the year and no revenues needed to hold ees revenue flat relative to last year this adds up to  million or  at the midpoint of our revenue guidance now i’d like to turn things back to wahid to discuss av’s expectations for the remainder of the year wahid nawabi thanks teresa we continue execute our strategy building on leading positions and our core business and moving our growth portfolio toward the significant longterm market opportunities were pursuing we remain the leading supplier of small uas to the us dod our international small uas business is thriving tms is growing cis is poised for launch and we see great progress in ees we’re also very much aware of the variability and our shortterm financial performance due to uncertainties associated with customer adoption as we have stated throughout this fiscal year our results have been in line with our expectations we’ve been preparing for our expected increase in revenue during the fourth quarter to achieve our full year outlook we have been ordering long lead items in advance preparing documentation for export license request to the us department of state building inventory and implementing additional efficiency enhancements across the organization even with our planning and preparation as our international business and the number of customers were servicing has grown our exposure to delays associated with contracting exporting licensing and even travel visa approvals have increased as we look to the balance of the fiscal year with this exposure in mind we now expect full year financial results at the low end of our previously stated revenue and earnings per share guidance range of  million to  million and  to  respectively once again our main messages today are first third quarter revenue – performance exceeded our expectations second high third quarter funded backlog of  million demonstrates continued strong customer demand for innovative solutions and third we anticipate growth this year in tactical missile systems and international small uas and we’re excited about the availability of our commercial information solutions later this calendar year thanks to our customers who placed their trust in aerovironment to help them precede with certainty thanks to you our stockholders who trust us to create longterm value and thanks to our employees for their continuous efforts to deliver on our commitments now teresa steve and i will take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ken herbert with canaccord ken herbert hi good afternoon wahid nawabi good afternoon ken ken herbert hi wahid hey i just wanted to followup specifically on the international growth you’re seeing within the small unmanned aircraft or the small unmanned systems market i mean clearly seems like that’s been a real source of upside over the last few quarters can you provide any commentary specifically around risks to this from a timing standpoint have you seen it sounds like most of this obviously is in your backlog but are you seeing any concern past sort of the fourth quarter of  into fiscal  around sustainability of this growth and any change recently in sort of the attitude amongst your customers since the election in particular internationally wahid nawabi ken that’s a great question the question that we think about and discuss and analyze quite thoroughly internally overall as you know our international sales this year in the past year as well grown significantly and we expect this growth to continue throughout fiscal  given and knowing that we have significant revenue and growth in this space the size of these orders and contracts are large in nature and the number – i would refer to as a hurdles that we’ve to go through in order to secure a contract to get international travel schedules arranged get these approvals for some of our customers to come for demonstrations and factory acceptance tests as well as securing export licenses from our us department of state always is a risk factor and continues to be a risk factor in terms of the timing of those orders being transformed into revenue and so for that matter we do see those risks as we’ve always seen and that has been the nature of our business in regards to the prospects for the longterm we remain confident about our international small uas business i’ve said this in the previous earnings calls that our assessment is that the international markets for small uas is about  to  years behind the adoption curve of the us domestic dod market and so that means that we believe in the long run we will see more adoption of our products and need for our products internationally and we look forward to that however the timing of those orders always is a tough challenge to predict precisely ken herbert thanks wahid just as a followup to that are you seeing as much demand internationally on the services side as you establish sort of a foothold with the products and does that something that you’ve seen much of the upside there yet or is that really upside that could be coming here in the future wahid nawabi so pretty much ken on all of our international customers we not only provide to our customers with a family of systems or systems solution but also services related to training and enabling their force just to be able to operate these systems effectively so they can get the actionable intelligence that they need – they deserve to precede with certainty as well as support and logistics services such as spare parts and a sustainment as well as repair activities that goes beyond just the initial acquisition of system solution and services and so usually almost all of our international as well as domestic customers have a long life cycle with us beyond the initial procurement and once we are into the sustainment mode we also get an opportunity to provide upgrades beyond just spare parts and sustainment ken herbert thank you very much i’ll stop there wahid nawabi you’re welcome operator operator instructions your next question comes from joseph de nardi with stifel joseph de nardi yes thank you very much wahid i’m just wondering if you can talk a little bit about where we are kind on the this curve of reinvesting core earnings back into the business for some of the growth drivers is that kind of come to an end next year i mean you’re going to generate a decent amount of earnings in fourth quarter so i was think about what the run rate is for next year wahid nawabi joe great question again so our – as i mentioned in my remarks previously as well as today our domestic us dod as you know primarily with the us army we’re what i’d referred to as an sustainment mode they have the number or the quantity of systems that our us dod customer believes primarily us army to maintain and meet the requirements that they had intended to achieve and in the past several years as you know we have been providing a significant amount of spare parts repair activities and upgrades to our existing fleet so beyond that we have opportunity to sell and deliver new solutions for new requirements of our existing customers and new customers for example the snipe uab that i just mentioned in this call and also the last call is a new requirement by the us army for soldier borne sensor which we believe were positioned extremely well and we’re going to be delivering  systems for demonstration in evaluation and beyond that we’ve been engage in the last year or two with us navy for the maritime application of our puma ae system so in the domestic market we continue to serve our domestic existing customers with sustainment and upgrade and we also continue to pursue new growth opportunities with new customers or existing customers or new products and last we also believe that while the lifecycle of the first generation of uabs with the us domestic customers is going to sometime come to an end it will – we believe that it will initiate the procurement of what we referred to as the second generation of our small uas solutions to our us domestic customers and that will take a little bit of time however we do look forward to that and we are working towards that opportunity outcome joseph de nardi okay and then maybe just on the balance sheet with the plan for the cash i mean maybe on the commercial or enterprise side of the business do you see yourselves as acquirers in that market or is it too early really to do that wahid nawabi we joe believe that the commercial information solutions or the commercial application of drones and software analytics represents a very large but also a longterm opportunity and we’re very much as you said at the very very early stages of getting the right solution to the market for us we believe that our existing solutions that that we have demonstrated and unveiled is disruptive and has a unique and compelling value proposition that has received so far very strong positive customer feedback so we’re excited about launching that product and then we will be in a position to be able to test the market and then provide you with some updates as to what we expect in that market to happen related to the capabilities and acquisitions we’ve always had the belief and the intent to fill the gaps of our capabilities when we find opportunities for acquisitions of filling that gap either in terms of a timeframe or cost we could do it better and cheaper by acquisitions we will always do so so far we haven’t come across any that we believe and the board believes that is right for a decision an execution and implementation i also personally believe that there is quite significant investments going on in the space and the likelihood of properties becoming available at reasonable prices probably will improve over time with any other industry and when we find those opportunities we are – we will not hesitate to take action and deliver the result that we expect to our shareholders joseph de nardi thank you operator i’m showing no further questions in queue at this time i’d like to turn the call back to mr gitlin for any closing remarks steve gitlin thank you liz before we do close out one question that typically comes up on the call for teresa would be some indication of our expected capex this year and tax rate for the full year teresa would you mind addressing that teresa covington sure regarding our capital spend our history at aerovironment has been in the  to  of revenue range yeartodate we’ve spent  million on capital and i would expect our full year to be in  to  revenue range regarding our tax rate we estimate our full year tax rate and we start with the statutory rate of our federal and state and then we have both a deduction for our federal rd tax credit and then we also mention that we had a reserve release in q of  and so that would be our estimate of our full your tax rate is a combination of those factors steve gitlin great so with that we will close out and we thank you all for your attention today for your interest in aerovironment an archived version of this call all sec filings and relevant company and industry news
