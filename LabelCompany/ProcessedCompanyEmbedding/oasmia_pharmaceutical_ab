assistance questions call  or apply now menu about us our story we know the story all too well you or your loved one has a chronic illness you constantly worry about how you’re going to afford prescriptions sometimes you even have to grapple with the horrible question of whether you’re going to pay rent buy groceries keep the lights on or purchase your lifesaving medication we want this tugofwar to end but how simplefill was established in october of  after both founders personally experienced firsthand how vital prescription assistance programs truly are after experiencing frustrations at the bureaucracy of prescription assistance we decided to take the reins and create a new system that allows all patients to be treated with dignity respect and care so they can get the medications they need to live well simplefill began as a small team of dedicated advocates trying to find a solution to the high cost of brand name prescriptions over the years simplefill has grown into a company that proudly serves thousands of patients each month both insured and uninsured with the cost of their much needed brand name medications what we do simplefill is a program dedicated to offering efficient assistance for patients who are prescribed unaffordable medications we do this by using the available programs offered through the pharmaceutical companies and foundations that offer grant funding for chronic diseases we tailored a proprietary system which ensures patients receive their medications and never fall through the cracks each patient is assigned to an advocate who monitors their medications and eligibility in the programs our advocates continue to provide support even after the medication is received simplefill is a nationwide advocacy service that helps patients who do not have adequate financial resources and limited to no prescription coverage receive help with their medications the rarity of prescription assistance programs means there’s also a rarity in the amount of personal attention and care patients receive our mission is to change all of that and become not just a place to help patients get the prescriptions they need at a price they can afford but also lend a caring ear and provide a source of comfort during stressful and frightening times our advocates work directly with their patients’ doctors to obtain the correct prescription we double and triple check prescription names dosages and patient information to ensure our patients will receive their muchneeded medication with as little hassle as possible our elderly and sick patients cannot advocate for themselves and rely on simplefill to take care of the details while they focus on living well what makes us different your relationship with simplefill doesn’t end by receiving a pack of forms to fill out on your own our dedicated advocates interview you to determine how we can best help you in your search for lowcost prescriptions as experts we are familiar with prescription drug substitutions which could make a world of difference to your wallet as some medications are covered in prescription assistance plans while others are not we know the insurance industry is complicated with many barriers and bureaucracy many times our patients will have multiple doctors and multiple medications we advocate on behalf of our patients to alleviate the massive burden of understanding what type of assistance is available we find the best way to navigate those services we work with your doctor directly and send necessary paperwork to your doctor’s office your advocate will be in contact with them every step of the way once you reach out to your advocate you will hear a response within  hours if for some reason your prescription cannot be filled we also

best probiotic supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance the good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements we received encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group to make matters worse many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health with so many different brands we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review top  signs you should be taking

pill reviews probiotic supplement buyer’s guide for july  which probiotic supplement works best probiotic supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance the good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements we received encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group to make matters worse many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health with so many different brands we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review top  signs you should be taking probiotics taken antibiotics antiinflammatory pain meds or birth control in the last few years experienced digestive issues such as constipation diarrhea gas bloating upset stomach or have even had food poisoning at some point noticing skin blemishes acne dullness in skin rosacea psoriasis or eczema feeling depressed moody irritable brain fog or low energy get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year the importance of a “balanced gut” our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body the gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components carbohydrates fats proteins which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration it also regulates hormones and activates the immune system our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms bacteria fungi and viruses when in balance the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes yeasts and parasites which can cause an imbalance what is “leaky gut” syndrome our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response building up antibodies to fight back the problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones as these attacks continue over time it can lead to a variety of health problems a “leaky gut” may not be your fault the reality is that antibiotics pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut the processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes all of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria leading to gut and immune system disruption the results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs gas bloating constipation diarrhea and heartburn the internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne rosacea psoriasis and even eczema and if all of that was not bad enough an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression low energy and memory and recall issues this is why it is critical to rebalance your gut with a “quality” probiotic “good gut” bacteria secrets you may not have known you have more nerves in your gut than you do in your entire spinal cord your gut has  trillion bacteria  pounds worth and all those cells are more than the human cells that can be found in the rest of your entire body that’s a lot of cells in your gut having good gut bacteria dictates how well your immune system will function want glowing and clear skin good bacteria plays a vital role in the appearance of your skin a surprising  of the serotonin the happy molecule in your brain is made in your gut balance your gut with good bacteria and you can help improve your mood and achieve more mental clarity how probiotic supplements work probiotics supplements contain live strains of “good bacteria” delivered to your gut in a convenient daily pill which can help to balance your intestinal microbiome building your gut with more friendly bacteria can help prevent the overcolonization of “bad bacteria” which is a major factor in how well your immune system can respond to invading harmful pathogens and fight prevent infections research has shown that an optimal balance in your gut is  “good” bacteria to  “bad” bacteria although the perfect percentage may vary for each individual person the most important objective to achieve health is to create an environment for healthy bacteria to flourish it is essential to choose a highquality probiotic brand with the correct strains in the correct proportions to help bring your gut flora back into balance and prevent the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria   our probiotic research approach to determine which probiotics were effective and which were just marketing hype we first investigated the brands to asses if the ingredients in the pills themselves were the same as their labels claimed second we surveyed customers who have used these brands over time to get a better understanding of their experiences lastly we took a close look at online marketplaces like amazon and ebay to see what other actual customers were saying we then combined all these factors so we could properly review the best probiotic supplement products available today  essential ingredient criteria to a quality
