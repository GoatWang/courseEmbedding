alex palanza mary jane palanza and michael palanza v eric freling md edward j zelnick md and corina j waldman md case no  broward circuit court description medical malpractice filing date april   trial date march   judge thomas m lynch iv plaintiff attorneys linda alley and valerie conzo law office of sheldon schlesinger in fort lauderdale defense attorney liana silsby george hartz lundeen fulmer johnstone king  stevens in fort lauderdale details on april   mary jane palanza who was  weeks pregnant had her water break she called her obgyns office where she spoke with the surgeon on duty he told her to go to hollywood memorial hospital to be seen palanzas pregnancy was considered a high risk due to complications she encountered with a previous pregnancy at  weeks her doctors put a cerclage  a stitch  in place to close her cervix when she arrived at the hospital she was seen by dr zelnick a partner of her prenatal obgyn dr waldman zelnick examined her and saw that the stitch was still in place he tested for infection around the stitch since its presence increased the risk results of the test were not obtained for three days at which point they came back positive for infection zelnick gave palanza drugs to hold off labor and steroids to mature the babys lungs on the third day of her hospital stay after two days of contractions palanza gave birth to a boy alex freling was the doctor in the delivery room he had examined palanza earlier in the day and had told palanza to try to hold in the baby because he was too small to deliver alex was born with a grade  on a scale of  brain hemorrhage and cerebral palsy which has affected three of his limbs alex has had to have subsequent surgery to loosen his leg muscles to allow him to walk he currently can walk with pronounced gait and balance problems alley said she said he will be ok cognitively but will have to work harder in school to keep up plaintiffs case alley and conzo argued that negligence on the part of zelnick freling and waldman led to alexs disabilities no one checked palanzas cervix the day she went into labor alley said and therefore no one knew she was almost fully dilated and the baby ready to be born the morning of april   the buildup of pressure combined with the uterine infection and the premature birth caused alexs brain hemorrhage alley said she argued that the doctors examining palanza needed to take out the cerclage in order to relieve the pressure on alex and that palanzas doctors should have started her on antibiotics when she arrived at the hospital experts also testified alley said that because of her previous pregnancy complications palanza should have been put on bed rest defense case silsby argued the doctors did everything appropriately and the reason for the hemorrhage was alexs premature birth the doctors followed all appropriate care she said outcome after a fiveweek trial and   days of deliberations the jury decided that freling was  percent responsible for alexs disability zelnick was  percent responsible and there was no negligence on the part of waldman the jury awarded  for alexs medical expenses  for his lost earning ability  million for his past pain and suffering and  million for future pain and suffering the award totaled  million the jury also awarded  to mary jane and michael palanza for alexs past and future medical expenses posttrial silsby said the case is not yet over she said there will be a hearing tentatively set for may  to rule on modifications to the final judgment these may include offsets for settlements with other defendants there is also a pending defense motion for a new trial comments alley said she thinks the jury decided freling was most responsible for what happened to alex because palanza was clearly in labor the morning of the april   and instead of delivering the baby he gave her a lecture about not complaining and ignored the comments her nurse was relaying about palanzas pain  rebecca riddick linda alley photo by
