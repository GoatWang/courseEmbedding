japan post bank reportedly considers joining the consortium to acquire a stake in the toshiba unit jul   sk hynix inc kosea has demanded voting interest in toshiba memory corporation in the future stalling talks between toshiba corporation tse and a japaneseussouth korean consortium including sk hynix on a contract for the planned sale of the toshiba unit informed source said on july   meanwhile japan post bank co ltd tse is considering joining the consortium to acquire a stake in the toshiba unit for tens of billions of yen according to the sources the move is believed to be backed by the japanese government with the government concerned about possible leaks of toshibas flash memory technology the company has defended the planned sale to the consortium by stressing that technology leaks are unlikely as sk hynix will not have voting rights in the toshiba unit but the south korean member of the consortium now wants to own voting shares in toshiba memory in the future although it is ready initially to provide funds in the form of lending the future acquisition of voting shares in toshiba memory by sk hynix could prolong antitrust screenings of the unit sale
