had neither the staff nor the resources to identify acquisition candidates or to select motivate monitor and hold management accountable for executing the business plan lubar reasoned professional ownership® was put to the test when lubar acquired sorgel electric corp in collaboration with massachusetts mutual life state mutual life and first national bank of boston five years later sorgel had increased revenues  times and was merged into square d corp for a record return on investment over the years lubar  co has applied professional ownership® to many companies today our investments are
