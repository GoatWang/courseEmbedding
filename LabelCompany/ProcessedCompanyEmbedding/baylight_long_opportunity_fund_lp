opportunity fund is californias leading microfinance provider opportunity fund believes that small amounts of money and financial advice can help people make permanent and lasting change in their own lives driving economic mobility and building stronger communities we say “yes” to small business owners lowincome students and families because entrepreneurship education and sound financial habits are proven pathways to greater economic opportunity   our strategy combines microloans for small business owners and microsavings accounts to help students pay for college and families save for a rainy day as california’s leading microfinance provider our team has deployed  million and helped more than  people since      missionto advance the economic wellbeing of working people by helping them earn save and invest in their future visionopportunity fund believes that everyone should have the chance to build a dignified life regardless of their economic background our role is to help working families realize their dreams and move beyond worrying about how to live day to day by investing in those who don’t have ready access to financial resources we strive to break the cycle of poverty for good core values   message from ceo eric weaver at the beginning  when opportunity fund was just an idea  we didn’t know if small amounts of money and financial advice could be enough to enable people to make big changes for the better but i believed there was a way for working people to achieve life goals that once seemed out of reach simply because they didn’t have the financial means or knowhow over the last  years we have seen individuals graduate from higher education programs purchase homes save at a higher rate than the average american start small businesses that provide sustainable income and create jobs and build assets for their families most tell us that they could not have done it without the help opportunity fund provided but to me it’s clear all our clients needed was your belief in them and a chance to succeed i am proud that opportunity fund’s investors and staff recognize that entrepreneurship hard work and ideas—the pillars of silicon valley businesses—are also the pillars of its lower income communities together we are building a diverse vibrant community where opportunity knowledge and access to capital are within reach for everyone

crescat longshort hedge fund composite includes all accounts that are managed according to the firm’s longshort equity hedge fund strategy over which the manager has full discretion this hedge fund strategy strives to grow and protect client capital through an activelymanaged prudentlydiversified longbiased longshort equity portfolio comprised of liquid large and midcap global equities the manager follows a multidisciplinary valuebased investment process with risk controls the strategy blends topdown macroeconomic analysis with bottomup fundamental valuation the investment team’s macroeconomic analysis includes the valuation of currencies commodities industries and markets in order to develop global macroeconomic investment themes that are expressed in the strategy through long and short equity positions the manager may trade and invest in individual equities as well as exchangetraded funds and related options the strategy employs a moderate amount of leverage within constraints based on the investment team’s assessment of market risks and opportunities the strategy’s bottomup approach to equity valuation starts with a proprietary fundamental quantitative model that was originally built in  by the firm’s chief investment officer kevin c smith cfa the model applies an innovative and robust discountedfreecashflow methodology to produce daily valuations of the top  largest and mostliquid global equities that trade on a us exchange the fundamental quant model has been consistently refined and applied to managing this strategy since its inception the investment team performs additional qualitative analysis to validate buy and sell signals generated by the model and to integrate modeldriven ideas with the firm’s macro themes the goal of the
