if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric

would be helpfulgeoff jonesalteryx incproduct manager – user experience see more ideas labeled with preparation  stars default date format status under review submitted on ‎  pm submitted by thisistestnumber on ‎  pm  comment  new whenever alteryx recognizes a field as a date it should default to date not datetime i dont think im in the minority but i rarely need to see the date and the time  of all of my date fields do not have a time associate with them such as open date close date remodel date lease expiration date lease start date date record updated relocation date etc etc etc so i always get results like   which makes it difficult to query against without changing to just date i would venture to guess that most people dont use the time either but i may be wrong so defaulting to just date would save a lot of us that extra step for each date column see more ideas labeled with preparation  stars option to quickly include specific values of fields not just field names in formulae status under review submitted on ‎  pm submitted by lzsom on ‎  pm comment hi allwhen we create formulae or filters in alteryx it would be great not just tohave the option to include fields by their names in the formulae butalso have the option to include specific values from the fields right from a dropdown menu eg if i have a field called ‘region’ with  values like africa and middle easteurope etc filtering the database for these individual values of ‘region’would be simpler if i could just select the values themselves from a dropdownlist i have now the ‘variables’ small tab in the formula configuration window butevery time i have to type the value after selecting ‘region’ from the variablesthis is annoying with long field values  you have to be careful with pronunciationif a simple right click or a new tab in the configuration window would list me the valuesof the field eg only if a categorical variable  it can list the top  most frequent valuesit is simpler to write the formulathank youlaszlo see more ideas labeled with preparation  stars automatic rewire capability for upstream added tools status comments requested submitted on ‎  am submitted by margossianchrista on ‎  am  comments  new when working with complex modules it would be great to allow an option to add a tool upstream and automatically rewire to downstreams toolssimplified exampletext input flows to  filter and  formulae tool if i want to drag and drop a formulae icon after the text input to be applied to both paths i cant i have to either choose to apply to path  or to path  i know that you can right click press insert after and search for the tool but this is not a time efficient manner  you can also delete the wiring and rewire yourself but if you have mutliple downstream tools this is a pain  see more ideas labeled with configuration general preparation  stars datetimefirstofweek formula function status under review submitted on ‎  pm submitted by joelipski

submitted on ‎  am submitted by claje on ‎  am comment our alteryx users query a number of different data sources  some of these include external servers outside our controlto avoid any issues regarding locking we use the read uncommitted function as part of the data input tool as part of our baseline design probably  of the time or moreit would be very beneficial for our organization if there was a way for us to set this option to be checked by default so that it was one less thing users needed to remember when configuring a quick data pull see more ideas labeled with input output preparation tool improvement  stars only need one click to write a customer filter status completed submitted on ‎  pm submitted by joelipski on ‎  pm  comments  new i love the new basic filter option and it makes writing filters easyselfexpanatory for new users and helps with functions like isnull however im almost always writing what are now called custom filters and it takes two clicks to do thisfrom a user experience perspective it would be great if you could click in the expression box to write the filter rather than having to check the customer filter check box or start by creating a basic filter and then make it more complex using the custom filter box without having to check the tick boxfollowing on from this and something that is probably a lot harder to implement  but with the new basic filter it would be great to have a list of available fields populate the options to filter by  similar to the option that you get in calgary eg country  and then the drop down list would contain whatever is available in the data eg spain uk usa etc see more ideas labeled with preparation  star metadata editor module status new submitted on ‎  am submitted by jdw on ‎  am comment user story  as a data analyst i want to be able to easily edit my datas metadata so that downstream actions can easily consume and export my data  currently you can do a bulk edit of your datas metadata however this has to be done using the multifield formula however this solution is nonintuitive and seems to run counter to the solution design of alteryx where each and every step is its own module  a single module handling bulk and single columnattribute metadata transformations and editing would be a much more intuitive and b save analysts time of hand editing metadata  cheers  see more ideas labeled with new tool preparation  stars increment function status under review submitted on ‎  pm submitted by danielkresina on ‎  pm  comments  new it would be handy to have an increment function similar to sqls identity datatype that allows you to specify a seed and increment value  it would seem like a really simple tool to add  ideally the seed value could come from an incoming connection to give the flexibility of retrieving the seed value from a databaseive found a workaround explained on my blog here but it would just be handy to have this built in  see more ideas labeled with preparation  star advanced join macro  update and modify datasets status new submitted on ‎  pm submitted by pauleykamp on ‎  pm comment it would be really useful to have a join function that updated an existing file not a database but a flat or yxdb file the rough sas equivalent are the update and modify statementshttpsupportsascomdocumentationcdlenbasesshtmldefaultviewerhtmahtm the goal would be to have a join function that would allow you to update a master datasets missing variables from a transaction database and optionally to overwrite values on the master data set with current ones without duplicating records based on a common key the use case is you have an original file new information comes in and you want to fill in the data that was originally missing without overwriting the original data if there is data on the transaction file for that variable in this case only missing data is changed or as a separate use case you had original data which has now been updated and you do want to overwrite the original data in this case any variable with new values is updated and variables without new values is left unchanged why this is needed if you dont have a oracle type database it is difficult to do this task inside of alteryx and information changes over time customers buy new products customers update profiles you have a file that is missing some data and want to merge with a file that has better data for missing values but worse data for exisitng values it is from a different time period eg older  in theory you could do this with if isnull then replace statements but youd have to build them for each variable and have a long data flow to capture the correct updates now is is much faster to do it in sas and import the updated file back into alteryx

comments  new in the summary tool we often use the summary tool to concatenate strings  we love this functionality however we would also like to be able to concatenate just the unique values of strings this could be done if we ran the preceding text field through the unique tool first and then concatenate but when we are doing this for multiple text variables and when we need to summarize other types of data at the same time this becomes a very unnatural combination of joins  macros  thanks for consideringjeremy see more ideas labeled with preparation  star be able to highlight and

submitted by atabarezz on ‎  am comment ideain forecasting and in commercialsme risk scoring there is a need for trying vast number of algebraic equations which is a very cumbersome prosess lets add symbolic regression as a new competitive capability rationalesummations ratios power transforms and all combinations of a like are needed to be tested as new variables for a forecasting or prediction model doing this by hand manually is a though and long business and there is always a possibility for one to skip a valuable combination  symbolic regression is a novel techinique for automatically generating algebraic equations with use of genetic programming in every evolution a variable is selected checked if the equation is discriminatitive of the target variable at hand in every next step frequently observed variables will be selected more likely  benefit for clientsthis method produces variables mainly with nonlinear relationships it is a technique that will help in corporatecommercialsme risk modelling such that powerful risk models are generated from a hort list of bs and pl based algebraic equationsthere is potential use cases in algorithmic trading as well there are  very interesting world problems solved with symbolic regression herea very relevant thesis by sean wouter is attached as a pdf document for your reading pleasure r side of thingsive

comments  new idea some well known scoring methods use optimal binned variables for added robustness lets add this capability to alteryx retionaleheres a basic link on why to do that httpdocumentssoftwaredellcomstatisticstextbookoptimalbinning current status in alterys as im aware oftile tool or multifield binning tool for completing same task as tile tool on multiple fields splits the variables by  methodsequal records or intervals or sumssmart tileunique value manualunfortunately equal something binnings are bad idea as the values are categorized blindly irrespective of the effects on the predictive power of the models  what to dowhats needed is to bin both numerical and categorical variables optimally such that the weights of evidences woe should present a monotone increasing or decreasing pattern maybe at most a v or u shaped convex structure quick winwithout constraining ourselves with monotonicity or convex cases the easiest practice would be running a c or chaid tree algorithm produces multiple splits rather than binary splits in cart for a single variable and select the target as the dependent variable and all the resulting nodes will be the bins we are looking for doing this for multiple variables at once is the key to the tool to be generated clientsthis capability is sought by risk management departments building robust stable

ideas labeled with preparation  star temp output window  comment  message status under review submitted on ‎  pm submitted by cbridges on ‎  pm  comments  new it would be great to just have a little tool like a comment box that could be based on whatever you want like if you always want to see the max date at a certain point or the grand total it would be similar to how you can put formulas in the titles in tableau like current as of maxdate or something like that the best way i think would be to have it like the annotations but make it so you can turn it on or off at any stage in the workflow right now annotations are only show or hide all and make it dynamic based on results from the workflow up to that point right now im accomplishing this just by using a summary and browse tool and then i put the result in the title of the toolbox manually see more ideas labeled with preparation « previous    next » idea statuses new  comments requested  under review  on the roadmap  coming
