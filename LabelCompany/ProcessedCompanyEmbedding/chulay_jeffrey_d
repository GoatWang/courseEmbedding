stressrelated disorders mirnamediated mechanisms of longterm traumatic and nontraumatic memory storage neural regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche vascular ectonucleotidase regulation of ischemic stroke interdepartmental neuroscience center   abstract alpha antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited genetic condition characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha antitrypsin aat and increased risk of developing emphysema and liver disease which affects up to  individuals in the united states the only currently approved therapy for this orphan disease is weekly intravenous infusions of aat protein that has been purified from normal plasma donors the current therapy is in short supply resulting in low physician motivation to accurately diagnose the vast majority of patients since not all of the minority of patients who are currently diagnosed are able to receive treatment the longterm objective of the research proposed in this application is to develop and bring to market a novel gene therapy product for the treatment of alpha antitrypsin deficiency using a recombinant adenoassociated virus raav serotype  vector expressing the human aat gene raavcbhaat raav vectors are uniquely suitable for in vivo gene therapy because they are nontoxic highly efficient at transducing a wide variety of nondividing cell types and persist for long periods primarily in episomal form resulting in longterm expression of the transgene the specific aim of this research proposal is to perform a phase  clinical trial of raavcbhaat the study is a nonrandomized openlabel multicenter sequential threearm phase  clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of administration of a raavcbhaat vector administered by intramuscular im injection each participant will receive raavcbhaat on a single occasion three groups of three subjects each will receive raavcbhaat at dosage levels of  x  vector genome vgkg  x  vgkg or  x  vgkg by im injection subjects in group  will receive a total of  im injections distributed across a single muscle site subjects in group  will receive a total of  im injections distributed across three muscle sites and subjects in group  will receive  im injections distributed across muscle sites each injection will be given in a volume of  ml at the appropriate vector concentration to achieve the desired total vector dose and the injection density at each administration site nine im injections per  cm skin surface area will be the same as the injection density that was well tolerated in a previous phase  clinical trial with raavcbhaat safety will be monitored by evaluation of adverse events hematology and clinical chemistry parameters histological examination of muscle biopsies and measurement of serum antibodies to aat efficacy will be measured by evaluation of serum concentrations of mspecific aat and total aat and serum aat phenotype determined on isoelectric focusing gels additional information to be collected will include presence of the vector in blood or semen changes in serum antiaav antibody titers and changes in t cell responses to aav and aat results from this phase  trial will be used to develop a phase  study designed to satisfy the requirements for licensure of a gene therapy treatment for this orphan disease public health relevance alpha antitrypsin deficiency is an important public health issue that affects up to  americans but the vast majority of patients are not treated due to extremely limited supplies of the only therapy currently available this project will evaluate a novel gene therapy product for the treatment of alpha antitrypsin deficiency in a phase  clinical trial to evaluate safety and the ability to achieve serum levels of alpha antitrypsin protein that are adequate to reduce the risk of lung disease caused by alpha antitrypsin deficiency   funding agency agencynational institute of health nih institutefood and drug administration fda typeresearch project r

supplements abstract purpose  to select the preferred adenoassociated virus aav capsid and promoter and to construct a stable fulllength retinitis pigmentosa gtpase regulator rpgr cdna for aavbased gene therapy of xlinked retinitis pigmentosa xlrp caused by mutations in the rpgr gene methods  grk and irbp are two small photoreceptor specific promoters able to drive rpgr transgene expression in dogs with xlrp disease beltran et al  the ability of irbp and grk promotors and aavtyf and aav capsids to target photoreceptors was evaluated in nonhuman primates nhps by subretinal injection of aav vectors containing a gfp expression cassette cynomolgus macaques receiving bilateral subretinal injection of  ml of aav vector at a concentration of  x  vgml or  x vgml were followed for up to  weeks gfp expression was evaluated by observation of fluorescence inlife and by qrtpcr and immunohistochemistry postmortem hrpgr cdna was codon modified based on the cdna sequence published by alan wright variant c nm the codon modified hrpgr cdna encodes a full length hrpgr protein whose amino acid sequence is  identical to the published sequence synthesized hrpgr cdna was first cloned in puc cloning vector and then in aav plasmid for aav production stability of hrpgr cdna sequence was confirmed by dna sequencing at each step of cloning and also in the aav preparations results  in nhps direct comparison between aavtyfgrkgfp and aavgrkgfp revealed that aavtyfgrkgfp achieved an overall better gfpreporter gene expression in photoreceptors than aavgrkgfp at both dose levels in contrast to the observation from published studies in dogs minimal or no gfp expression was present in the eyes receiving the aavirbpgfp vector the redesigned fulllength rpgr cdna cloned in either a conventional cloning vector or in an aav plasmid was stable during large scale plasmid production and aav vector manufacturing conclusions  the grk promoter was significantly more efficient than irbp promoter at directing expression in primate photoreceptors and aavtyf is a preferred capsid a stable rpgr cdna that encode fulllength native rpgr protein was obtained these results should inform the design of an aav vector for treatment of patients with xlrp this is an abstract that was submitted for the  arvo annual meeting held in seattle wash may   this work is licensed under a creative commons
