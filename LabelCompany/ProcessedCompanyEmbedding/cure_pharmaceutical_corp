million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having

are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that

condition ever he prescribed a medication that didn’t do anything but make the boil worst i was in so much pain for about  days i have a  month old who is very active i could barley hold or rock him to sleep i was in so much pain i then came across emuaid  was kind of skeptical at first but nothing else was working so why not give it a shot the reviews were great so i order the emuaid max ordered it tuesday morning received it thursday started to use it immediately today is saturday and the boil has already popped  this was a life saver i was shocked how fast it work  love love love this product  j davis   i have been a sufferer of hs for   years this is the only thing that helps me with pain inflammation tenderness this product will be in my medicine cabinet forever for any and all skin issues thanks emuaid   lorraine m   this is my second order and i am so pleased with this product it is a life saver for treating my boils thank you so much  joihelene h   i’m  years old african american female single never married and no children i’ve had hidradenitis suppurativa hs or acne inversa ai for about  to  years it started very small and has built up to make me very unhappy frustrated and honestly depressed about the prospect of romantically socializing my breakout is located in the pelvis groin area and under my belly upper pelvis i have rd stage hsai with multiple cysts many with sinus tracks deepseated abscesses they are located in the inner thighs vulva and buttocks as well i do not have many of the cysts coming to head or seeping pus most have no seepage or are lightly bloody andor clear seepage from the large deepseated abscesses i was using strong zit gel zit cleanser hibiclens and polysporin to take care of my breakouts i stumbled upon a youtube video of a young lady from europe talking about your product emuaid at first i was extremely skeptical about her testimony though the video was short amateurishly crafted her testimony video rang extremely true to my need i found myself ordering it and received it in the mail tuesday evening august   i used it in only one location to test my reactions around pm that night after following the directions i have extremely sensitivity skin and can have allergic reactions easily so i wanted to play it safe i awoke around am to use the facilities and found that the area i had administered the emuaid on was much changed the abscess had had a sinus track creating a new cyst on my outerthigh it was now shrunk almost twice in size with the sinus track gone and the new cyst flattened and almost completely disappeared to say i was amazed and excited is an understatement i immediately started using it all over my pelvis area including my vulva i had no stinging or ill results in fact the total opposite it was cooling soothing and felt healing immediately i am totally amazed at your product i wish i had known about it sooner i would love to show you pictures but of course i can’t due to the breakout location but i want you to know that i’m telling all my clinician friends about this amazing product and all that it can do for skin issues especially ones as serious as hsai last week i had finally gone to a dermatologist who had recommended putting me on a very strong drug it has horrible side effects and my instincts told me to not to take it i’m a singer and voice artist and taking that medicine would have been harmful to my voice instrument after consulting two pharmacists two nurse practitioners and a few nurse friends i decided not to take it and told the dermatologist i’m so glad that in the meantime i discovered emuaid instead thank you i have a background in marketing if you would like to utilize me as a spokesperson please let me know i would like to help others who have suffered like i have to know about this product showhide all customer reviews     happy c   my husband has hidradentitis supportive and has used emuaid for several years it along with antibiotics

  loetitia   best treatment i have ever found in  years to calm hs flares…………it’s great   anonymous customer   words cannot explain i have hs and although their is no known cure this has done wonders to my flare ups it brought immediate relief  nicole   so ive been using it for almost two weeks now here are my findings i decided in the beginning to pick an area and stick with that area well that didnt last because i started to flare in another spot and emuaid makes it feel so much better i had one start to come up in my butt crack sorry for the verbage yesterday and i applied it  times and this morning it was down and less tender the spot i originally started to focus on was my lower tummy where i have one that constantly fills and is hard under the skin with some mild sinus tracking seems as though the emuad has not only made the hardness under my skin in that particulaar area soften and condense in size but also repairing the skin and its color from the scaring we all love those purple scars my right armpit the lesser affected one by hs had some mild scaring and bumps are completely gone now to work on my left armpit its the worst with a lesion that never goes away emu aid makes that lesion feel better but i know its going to take time on that to go away i am happy with the results and im thinking it helps my purple scars too no its not a cure all but a helpfull tool if these results continue until the whole free trial tub is gone i will be a customer for life i also slather some on in the bad areas b excersise to help prevent friction and chaffing and it works wonders im estatic for those of you that are on the trial and it is working for you i know everyone is different and i continue to pray for those with no luck or bad reaction to the product hope that u find some thing that works for you soon  alina   i’m on day  using it at bedtime i have definitely noticed less inflammation and many of the red areas are now pink — under arms and upper thighs  amber   i have been using the product for about a week and a half i still have not recieved a questionare i have taken before pics and will take one on fri as it will be the  week mark and post them

flare i used it on seemed alot more painful after i applied it i used it on some areas that felt like they were getting ready to flare and they never did it doesn’t seem to do much for the active flares  carletta   i’ve been using mine for a week and i’ve noticed a significant change in my groin area just got a spot on my belly button to pop up and i started putting it there today  christine

glad to have found emuaid i am amazed at how fast and effective it is i’m a believer  linda   i expected to throw this back in my doctor’s face when it didn’t work i couldn’t because it worked i was shocked i have a terrible case of hs went to a surgeon to have it removed he said he couldn’t because it was too close to the pelvic bone it wouldn’t heal but he told me to get emuaid and try it i was mad thought he was copping out on me but i was determined to go and get it and show him i tried it and it didn’t work like everything else i tried and then what else would he tell me the first day of using it it calmed things down a week later i wasn’t bleeding and dripping all over the place and then they went down so that they were not hurting amazing i laughed and made jokes about it tried it on my brothers mosquito bites it worked a friend had a bbq blow up in her face she used it and a week later you would never know it had happened i am on my th jar doesn’t cure it but makes it so much more bareable and my brother has a jar and my friend who had the bbq explode on her i wish it wasn’t as expensive since i have to use so much of it or maybe they could have a punch card and after so many jars you get a free one i am like the man on the greek wedding putting windex on everything i put emuaid on everything and it works  dawn   loooove this product it is all it says it is i have hs

uses for her diabetic mother my son has been using emuaid for the past two months and although he still gets breakouts they are minimized in size frequency and the healing time has maximized and the pain is minimum recently a determatologist was able to diagnose his condition with the grim news that it’s an annoying incurable chronic condition with the use of emuaid he gets much needed relief for his symptoms not a cure but finally we found something that helps in my last order of emuaid i order one for myself due to dryitchy skin due to diabitic thank you so much for your product  brenda

promised expeditiously thank you monica within  hours after application there was a noticeable difference within  hours today she is still making progress i hope this continues i might also add that she is taking the probiotic as well  ilanhovan   it really works… hi i’m from south east asia and i’m been suffering from bad hs for last  years and beginning of this year i’ve developed fistulla at groin area which was very painful and limited all my social activities out there i almost gave up after the dermalogist to me there is no cure that’s the time i found emuaid oilment on the net and bought  jar for trial i was so happy when the fistulla eventually healed with the application of this oilment and the pain was not there emuaid gave me a new life even though my hs is not cured and i still have problems with it this oilment got rid of the fistulla which was a great pain to bear mentally and physically now i just started emuaid first defense probiotic supplement i hope it will give me a good results to cure the hs from inside to hs sufferers like me please try out emuaid it really works rather than depending on oral supplements from the dermalogist  joseph   hydradenitis supprativa kept in check with emuaid finally a product that works and at a very good price  linda   used emuaid once and i love it have been suffering from hidradentis suppurativa and now have found relief i can’t believe it i am going to order another bottle  cynthia   living again  loving it i had been suffering with hydridentis supportiva hs for over  years i was an extremely active person working out  days a week  my favorite hobby was dancing well that all changed once i was finally diagnosed with hs my quality of life was greatly affected this condition made it painful to wear clothing the pain  intense itching associated with hs is unbearable years of steroids antibiotics ice packs  the such all equaled up to the sum of no relief two weeks after i began using emuaid which i’ve affectionately nicknamed mu the itching was significantly decreased  two months after the flares ups were decreased and now i would say i am in  remission the flares ups are now far  few between i’m back to working out and i put on clothes to go out dancing so close to the holidays if you are suffering with hs or any other skin disorder that involves pain  itching and loved ones ask you what they should put in your stocking tell them emuaid i would highly recommend you give this a try emuaid gave me back my life  nana yaa   god answered my prayers with emuaid first aid ointment i am about to order the maximum strength first aid ointment after  day of using the product i was not happy when i got a small amount of the product however the product is an answer to my prayers it works excellent i have cystic breast and cyst that becomes boils on my breast very rare condition it is herediteral went on mission and some how the shots caused my rashes to explode and have left open sores nothing worked until now thank you for creating this product  dawn   emuaid the hs skin disease relief medicine consistent use of emuaid will result in relief of the most irritating and painful skin diseases i have had hs for  years and have taken all sorts of prescriptions and had surgeries nothing has helped quite like the emuaid if you have hs i totally recommend emuaid with consistent use you will experience relief from this very painful condition give it a try you won’t be sorry sounds like some past reviewers were not patient or consistent enough with the use hs is a very infection ridden skin disease and sometimes the flare ups are very involved it could take days maybe a couple of weeks with consistent use of emuaid to experience the real results i cannot stress enough about the consistent use hs is not cureable and emuaid is not a cure but it surely will help the pain and anything is an improvement with as painful as it can be i will buy this product for the rest of my life…………  alpha   not a cure but a great relief i had major surgery to remove a large area polluted with hidradenitis recently the hs has started returning causing large painful boils in my skin i was extremely skeptical with this product but the price is what i would pay to see a doctor anyway so i took a gamble the package arrived very quickly and they included the trial pills as well  the smell of the product is of tea tree oil but not as strong it is not a smell i find offensive but some may the moment i applied the ointment i felt relief to the area not a ‘deadened nerve feeling’ but a soothing pain free feeling it allows me to get through my day without the pain from these boils it appears to lessen the smaller ones and bring the bigger ones to a head faster sorry for being gross i am very happy with emuaid i don’t guarantee it will work for everyone but that is why they have a great return policy give it a try if it works for you then great if not then get a refund and try to find something else hope this helps  delores   a miracle for my daughter my daughter has suffered and i mean suffered from hs for years now she did ‘t have one day that was pain free sometimes she would lay and just cry i gave emuaid a shot after reading some very positive reviews the results for her were truly amazing within  hours she was pain free she cried again but with happiness she is no longer taking pain pills at all she can move without pain etc she was skeptical and so quit emuaid for a few days to test if it really was the emuaid or not her pain came back within about  hours needless to say she went back on emuaid and is enjoying life once again pain free if you haven’t tried emuaid you must it truly will change your life it is worth every penny i give emuaid a million stars  holly   life saver i am  and was recently diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa and have been dealing with scars under my armpits and groin area for the last year i even had them

of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly

todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover

didn’t do anything but make the boil worst i was in so much pain for about  days i have a  month old who is very active i could barley hold or rock him to sleep i was in so much pain i then came across emuaid  was kind of skeptical at first but nothing else was working so why not give it a shot the reviews were great so i order the emuaid max ordered it tuesday morning received it thursday

is my second order and i am so pleased with this product it is a life saver for treating my boils thank you so much  joihelene h   i’m  years old african american female single never married and no children i’ve had hidradenitis suppurativa hs or acne inversa ai for about  to  years it started very small and has built up to make me very unhappy frustrated and honestly depressed about the prospect of romantically socializing my breakout is located in the pelvis groin area and under my belly upper pelvis i have rd stage hsai with multiple cysts many with sinus tracks deepseated abscesses they are located in the inner thighs vulva and buttocks as well i do not have many of the cysts coming to head or seeping pus most have no seepage or are lightly bloody andor clear seepage from the large deepseated abscesses i was using strong zit gel zit cleanser hibiclens and polysporin to take care of my breakouts i stumbled upon a youtube video of a young lady from europe talking about your product emuaid at first i was extremely skeptical about her testimony though the video was short amateurishly crafted her testimony video rang extremely true to my need i found myself ordering it and received it in the mail tuesday evening august   i used it in only one location to test my reactions around pm that night after following the directions i have extremely sensitivity skin and can have allergic reactions easily so i wanted to play it safe i awoke around am to use the facilities and found that the area i had administered the emuaid on was much changed the abscess had had a sinus track creating a new cyst on my outerthigh it was now shrunk almost twice in size with the sinus track gone and the new cyst flattened and almost completely disappeared to say i was amazed and excited is an understatement i immediately started using it all over my pelvis area including my vulva i had no stinging or ill results in fact the total opposite it was cooling soothing and felt healing immediately i am totally amazed at your product i wish i had known about it sooner i would love to show you pictures but of course i can’t due to the breakout location but i want you to know that i’m telling all my clinician friends about this amazing product and all that it can do for skin issues especially ones as serious as hsai last week i had finally gone to a dermatologist who had recommended putting me on a very strong drug it has horrible side effects and my instincts told me to not to take it i’m a singer and voice artist and taking that medicine would have been harmful to my voice instrument after consulting two pharmacists two nurse practitioners and a few nurse friends i decided not to take it and told the dermatologist i’m so glad that in the meantime i discovered emuaid instead thank you i have a background in marketing if you would like to utilize me as a spokesperson please let me know i would like to help others who have suffered like i have to know about this product showhide all customer reviews     happy c   my husband has hidradentitis supportive and has used emuaid for several years it along with antibiotics has managed the outbreaks my

good i got the extra strength this time i am assured that it will work as well or better nothing i have tried before worked until i discovered this product it’s a miracle in a jar   loetitia   best treatment i have ever found in  years to calm hs flares…………it’s great   anonymous customer   words cannot explain i have hs and although their is no known cure this has done wonders to my flare ups it brought immediate relief  nicole   so ive been using it for almost two weeks now here are my findings i decided in the beginning to pick an area and stick with that area well that didnt last because i started to flare in another spot and emuaid makes it feel so much better i had one start to come up in my butt crack sorry for the verbage yesterday and i applied it  times and this morning it was down and less tender the spot i originally started to focus on was my lower tummy where i have one that constantly fills and is hard under the skin with some mild sinus tracking seems as though the emuad has not only made the hardness under my skin in that particulaar area soften and condense in size but also repairing the skin and its color from the scaring we all love those purple scars my right armpit the lesser affected one by hs had some mild scaring and bumps are completely gone now to work on my left armpit its the worst with a lesion that never goes away emu aid makes that lesion feel better but i know its going to take time on that to go away i am happy with the results and im thinking it helps my purple scars too no its not a cure all but a helpfull tool if these results continue until the whole free trial tub is gone i will be a customer for life i also slather some on in the bad areas b excersise to help prevent friction and chaffing and it works wonders im estatic for those of you that are on the trial and it is working for you i know everyone is different and i continue to pray for those with no luck or bad reaction to the product hope that u find some thing that works for you soon  alina   i’m on day  using it at bedtime i have definitely noticed less inflammation and many of the red areas are now pink — under arms and upper thighs  amber   i have been using the product for about a week and a half i still have not recieved a questionare i have taken before pics and will take one on fri as it will be the  week mark and post them i have had one flair up since using emuaid because of the stress of changing jobs but it hasnt been as bad as it usually is and has calmed down much sooner the redness and inflamation are both more controled it seems and the pain level is down considerably i will continue to document and use the product  kelly   i have been using mine for about a week the extreme itching seems better the first flare i used it on seemed alot more painful after i applied it i used it on some areas that felt like they were getting ready to flare and they never did it doesn’t seem to do much for the active flares  carletta   i’ve been using mine for a week and i’ve noticed a significant change in my groin area just got a spot on my belly button to pop up and i started putting it there today  christine   i used it last night for the first time under both arms within  minutes the pain and most of the swelling had gone down i now move both arms with out feeling like the skin is going to rip also i put in on areas that had already had opened and half way drained  randi   i have only been using the emuaid and aleve it has brought me drastic relief and does help to bring them to a head so i can drain them myself i love emuaid  tammy   excellent i cant tell you how glad i am that i have found emuaid i have hidradenitis suppurativa i received emuaid in the mail within two days and as soon as i applied it to my out break it helped the pain stopped and the swelling receded in about four days all was clear there is no doubt that i will continue to use emuaid thank you so much i now have something that will help me

case of hs went to a surgeon to have it removed he said he couldn’t because it was too close to the pelvic bone it wouldn’t heal but he told me to get emuaid and try it i was mad thought he was copping out on me but i was determined to go and get it and show him i tried it and it didn’t work like everything else i tried and then what else would he tell me the first day of using it it calmed things down a week later i wasn’t bleeding and dripping all over the place and then they went down so that they were not hurting amazing i laughed and made jokes about it tried it on my brothers mosquito bites it worked a friend had a bbq blow up in her face she used it and a week later you would never know it had happened i am on my th jar doesn’t cure it but makes it so much more bareable and my brother has a jar and my friend who had the bbq explode on her i wish it wasn’t as expensive since i have to use so much of it or maybe they could have a punch card and after so many jars you get a free one i am like the man on the greek wedding putting windex on everything i put emuaid on everything and it works  dawn   loooove this product it is all it says it is i have hs that i have

said why not nothing else worked maybe this stuff will i am so glad that i did i use it almost everyday to prevent future flareups not only does this ointment clear it up and heal the area it keeps it from coming back i am just so grateful for this company and this product i can now enjoy wearing a bikini at the pool in the summertime without embarrassment plus i dont have to buy massive amounts of

thank you thank you thank you so much  carmen   miraculous ointment my son has been suffering from painful recurrent boils for over  years a friend recommended emuaid which she uses for her diabetic mother my son has been using emuaid for the past two months and although he still gets breakouts they are minimized in size frequency and the healing time has maximized and the pain is minimum recently a determatologist was able to diagnose his condition with the grim news that it’s an annoying incurable chronic condition with the use of emuaid he gets much needed relief for his symptoms not a cure but finally we found something that helps in my last order of emuaid i order one for myself due to dryitchy skin due to diabitic thank you so much for your product  brenda   this product

improvement  cheryl   our urgent need was speer lab’semuaid’s priority my daughter has had hs for  years i have searched high and low for a product to treat this horrible condition to date this is the only product that i have found thus far symptomatic treatment my daughter had to have incision and drainage with packing for one of these horrible boils about the size of a golf ball on the buttocks with recurrence of the boil within a week this is when definitely in a panic i called and spoke with speer labs in an effort to get an expedited shipment of emuaid this was shipped as promised expeditiously thank you monica within  hours after application there was a noticeable difference within  hours today she is still making progress i hope this continues i might also add that she is taking the probiotic as well  ilanhovan   it really works… hi i’m from south east asia and i’m been suffering from bad hs for last  years and beginning of this year i’ve developed fistulla at groin area which was very painful and limited all my social activities out there i almost gave up after the dermalogist to me there is no cure that’s the time i found emuaid oilment on the net and bought  jar for trial i was so happy when the fistulla eventually healed with the application of this oilment and the pain was not there emuaid gave me a new life even though my hs is not cured and i still have problems with it this oilment got rid of the fistulla which was a great pain to bear mentally and physically now i just started emuaid first defense probiotic supplement i hope it will give me a good results to cure the hs from inside to hs sufferers like me please try out emuaid it really works rather than depending on oral supplements from the dermalogist  joseph   hydradenitis supprativa kept in check with emuaid finally a product that works and at a very good price  linda   used emuaid once and i love it have been suffering from hidradentis suppurativa and now have found relief i can’t believe it i am going to order another bottle  cynthia   living again  loving it i had been suffering with hydridentis supportiva hs for over  years i was an extremely active person working out  days a week  my favorite hobby was dancing well that all changed once i was finally diagnosed with hs my quality of life was greatly affected this condition made it painful to wear clothing the pain  intense itching associated with hs is unbearable years of steroids antibiotics ice packs  the such all equaled up to the sum of no relief two weeks after i began using emuaid which i’ve affectionately nicknamed mu the itching was significantly decreased  two months after the flares ups were decreased and now i would say i am in  remission the flares ups are now far  few between i’m back to working out and i put on clothes to go out dancing so close to the holidays if you are suffering with hs or any other skin disorder that involves pain  itching and loved ones ask you what they should put in your stocking tell them emuaid i would highly recommend you give this a try emuaid gave me back my life  nana yaa   god answered my prayers with emuaid first aid ointment i am about to order the maximum strength first aid ointment after  day of using the product i was not happy when i got a small amount of the product however the product is an answer to my prayers it works excellent i have cystic breast and cyst that becomes boils on my breast very rare condition it is herediteral went on mission and some how the shots caused my rashes to explode and have left open sores nothing worked until now thank you for creating this product  dawn   emuaid the hs skin disease relief medicine consistent use of emuaid will result in relief of the most irritating and painful skin diseases i have had hs for  years and have taken all sorts of prescriptions and had surgeries nothing has helped quite like the emuaid if you have hs i totally recommend emuaid with consistent use you will experience relief from this very painful condition give it a try you won’t be sorry sounds like some past reviewers were not patient or consistent enough with the use hs is a very infection ridden skin disease and sometimes the flare ups are very involved it could take days maybe a couple of weeks with consistent use of emuaid to experience the real results i cannot stress enough about the consistent use hs is not cureable and emuaid is not a cure but it surely will help the pain and anything is an improvement with as painful as it can be i will buy this product for the rest of my life…………  alpha   not a cure but a great relief i had major surgery to remove a large area polluted with hidradenitis recently the hs has started returning causing large painful boils in my skin i was extremely skeptical with this product but the price is what i would pay to see a doctor anyway so i took a gamble the package arrived very quickly and they included the trial pills as well  the smell of the product is of tea tree oil but not as strong it is not a smell i find offensive but some may the moment i applied the ointment i felt relief to the area not a ‘deadened nerve feeling’ but a soothing pain free feeling it allows me to get through my day without the pain from these boils it appears to lessen the smaller ones and bring the bigger ones to a head faster sorry for being gross i am very happy with emuaid i don’t guarantee it will work for everyone but that is why they have a great return policy give it a try if it works for you then great if not then get a refund and try to find something else hope this helps  delores   a miracle for my daughter my daughter has suffered and i mean suffered from hs for years now she did ‘t have one day that was pain free sometimes she would lay and just cry i gave emuaid a shot after reading some very positive reviews the results for her were truly amazing within  hours she was pain free she cried again but with happiness she is no longer taking pain pills at all she can move without pain etc she was skeptical and so quit emuaid for a few days to test if it really was the emuaid or not her pain came back within about  hours needless to say she went back on emuaid and is enjoying life once again pain free if you haven’t tried emuaid you must it truly will change your life it is worth every penny i give emuaid a million stars  holly   life saver i am  and was recently diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa and have been dealing with scars under my armpits and groin area for the last year i even had them removed by the doctor just to
