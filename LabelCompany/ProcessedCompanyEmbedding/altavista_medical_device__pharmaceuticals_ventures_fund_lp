negotiations in the local language of each asian country joint ventures joint venture structures regulations and opportunities will vary in each asian country for example when negotiating a joint venture in china it is often difficult to determine who is in charge on the chinese side of the table as government officials industry representatives factory executives and others may be involved in the negotiations these different parties on the chinese side may have competing interests in addition chinese documentation is often very vague and negotiations can drag on much longer than one would expect in the 99s most chinese joint ventures were  deals today joint venture deals with an  or even 9 ownership structure with the foreign partner holding the majority are more common licensing licensing of medical products will vary according to the asian market you are doing business in for example in japan in the early to mid99s many japanese licensing deals with western biotech companies were concluded without conducting sufficient due diligence and as a result there were many failures in recent years however japanese investors are more sophisticated and more due diligence is being done japanese firms today are likely to invest only in later stage deals if you are looking for expert assistance with your acquisition joint venture or licensing issues in asia please contact us
