is to continue to manage variable annuity sales in light of prudent growth and management of the company’s balance sheet source business wire  full story    reads what is driving the rush for the variable annuity exit the variable annuity industry in the us is highly concentrated  ten insurance companies generate roughly  percent of industry revenue and the top  companies generate over  percent of total sales a meaningful signal is sent when five of the top  variable annuity companies announce that they are either exiting the business entirely or paringback existing product lines this is exactly what has taken place over the past several months with the following companies dialing down their variable annuity exposure or pullingout entirely sun life the hartford jackson national ing metlife equity market volatility and low interest rates are the common themes running through the most or all of the retrenching decisions  there are a few way in which high volatility and low interest rates can hurt the companies that provide variable annuities poor equity market performance and low interest rates affect the value of guaranteed living benefits which are liabilities for the insurance company  poor stock market performance and low rates both increase the amount of the insurance company liability higher volatility results in higher hedging costs stock market performance affects the value of separate account assets which in turn affects fee income related to those assets under management many return on equity roe models consider capital market volatility or “beta” as a proxy for risk  in this context “extreme” capital market conditions create higher hurdle rates and result in lower return on equity metlife’s recent investor conference call sheds some light on the return on equity issue during the call metlife categorizes its product lines based by level of roe  there are three roe categories  greater than  percent     percent and  less than  percent retail annuities including variable annuities are in the less than  percent roe bucket included in this less than  percent bucket are other capital intensive business lines that require “margin improvement” metlife also alludes to capital intensity and the level of economic capital required in the variable annuity business  economic capital refers to the amount of capital that needs to be set aside to deal with the risks in a particular line of business  perceived risk is high in the capital markets right now so economic capital requirements are high as well the capital intensity theme was a major factor for the hartford as well the argument in favor of leaving the va business was based on the notion that capital could be allocated to more flexible and less intensive areas such as property and casualty lines a point to consider though is that all of these value assessments require the assumption that capital market conditions will continue to be as extreme as they have been over the past several years metlife sheds some light on the glass half full perspective when they talk about the potential leverage in their variable annuity business some points to consider as of march  metlife had total variable annuity liability balances of  billion  billion of the  billion had a living benefit rider of the  billion  billion was in the form of a guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib rider  percent of the gmib riders were in the money as of march  the gmib net amount at risk the additional money metlife would need to comeup with if everyone annuitized their gmib contract immediately as of march  was  billion if the sp  were to increase by  percent and the yield on  year treasuries increased by  percent metlife’s net amount at risk and in the money percentage would go “pretty close to ” only  out of the   billion worth of revenue variable annuity contracts sold by metlife over the past  years have a living benefit rider that is in the money today it seems that recent market volatility and ultra low interest rates could be distorting the perspectives of variable annuity issuers and the perspectives of certain shareholders of these companies maybe the world has entered a permanent state of high volatility and low interest rates then again maybe it has not  in any event there is at least a possibility that current perspectives on the variable annuity business are distorted by an overemphasis on recent experience sources metlife  reads    of  ›› key phrases key phrases retirementmutual fundsglossary annuityassetfixed annuityimmediate

variable life insurance policy is a form of permanent life insurance variable life insurance provides permanent protection to the beneficiary upon the death of the policyholder this type of insurance is generally more expensive than term insurance because it allows the insured to allocate a portion of the premium dollars to a separate account comprised of various instruments and investment funds within the insurance companys portfolio such as stocks bonds equity funds money market funds and bond funds next up universal life insurance life insurance adjustable life insurance whole life insurance policy breaking down variable life insurance policy because of investment risks variable policies are considered securities contracts and are regulated under the federal securities laws therefore they must be sold via a prospectus as a securities product fund performance may lead to declining cash value or death benefit over timevariable life insurance policies have certain tax benefits made available to policyholders such as the ability to utilize cash value on a taxbenefited basis as long as premiums are paid and the policy remains in force policyholders can access the cash value through a taxfree loan against the policy should cash value be withdrawn instead of borrowed the policyholder faces tax implications on any realized earnings any loans taken out that are not repaid have the potential to decrease the death benefit paid to beneficiaries at the time the insured passes awayvariable life insurance flexibilityone of the aspects of variable life insurance that makes it stand out among other permanent life insurance policies is the flexibility it provides policyholders in terms of premiums paid and cash value accumulation premiums paid to a variable life insurance policy are not fixed as they are with traditional whole life insurance or term insurance instead they can be shifted up or down over time within certain limits based on the insureds needs for example an insured with a variable life insurance policy may decide to reduce monthly premium payments from  to  because a major expense may have impeded cash flow for a period of time the cash value within the policy can be used to make up the shortage in premium payments during the time lower premium payments are made when cash flow returns to a comfortable level the insured has the option to increase premiums back to the initial  per monthdownsides of variable life insuranceunlike fixed life insurance products variable life insurance may require policyholders to add premiums over time to ensure the death benefit remains guaranteed to a certain age paying more than the minimum cost of insurance for a variable life insurance policy is one method to ensure guarantees remain intact additionally investment risks within the cash value of a variable life insurance policy fall completely on the policyholder not the insurance company as such there are no guarantees as to how well the cash value may perform over time making it difficult to plan for using accumulated earnings in the future like most life insurance policies individuals are required to undergo full medical underwriting to obtain a variable life insurance policy related terms universal life insurance a type of flexible permanent life insurance offering the lowcost  life insurance a protection against the

advertisements or other sales material when a subaccount advertises its standardized total return it will usually be calculated for one year five years and ten years or some other relevant periods if

to have a specified dollar amount transferred from either the general account option or the hartford money market subaccount whichever meets the applicable minimum value to other subaccounts of the separate account at monthly quarterly semiannual or annual intervals transfer intervals this is known as dollar cost averaging the main objective of a dollar cost averaging program is to minimize the impact of short term price fluctuations since the same dollar amount is transferred to other subaccounts at set intervals more units are purchased in a subaccount if the value per unit is low and less units are purchased if the value per unit is high therefore a  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th lower average cost per unit may be achieved over the long term a dollar cost averaging

how do i know what my participant account is worth your participant account value reflects the sum of the amounts under your participant account allocated to the general account option and the subaccounts there are two things that affect your subaccount value  the number of accumulation units and  the accumulation unit value the subaccount value is determined by multiplying the number of accumulation units by the accumulation unit value therefore on any valuation day the portion of your participant account allocated to the subaccounts will reflect the investment performance of the subaccounts and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying funds contributions made or contract values allocated to a subaccount are converted into accumulation units by dividing the amount of the contribution or allocation minus any premium taxes by the accumulation unit value for that valuation day the more contributions or contract values allocated to the subaccounts under your participant account the more accumulation units will be reflected under your participant account you decrease the number of accumulation units in a subaccount under your participant account by requesting surrenders transferring money out of a subaccount submitting a death benefit claim or by electing an annuity payout from your participant account to determine the current accumulation unit value we take the prior valuation days accumulation unit value and multiply it by the net investment factor for the current valuation day the net investment factor is used to measure the investment performance of a subaccount from one valuation day to the next the net investment factor for each subaccount is calculated by dividing a by b and subtracting c where a is the net asset value per share of each fund held in the subaccount at the end of the current valuation day b is the net asset value per share of each fund held in the subaccount at the end of the prior valuation day c is the daily factor representing the mortality and expense risk charge and any applicable administration charge deducted from the subaccount adjusted for the number of days in the valuation period and any other applicable charge we will send you a statement in each calendar quarter that tells you how many accumulation units you have their value and your total participant account value you can also call  to obtain your participant account value how are the underlying fund shares valued the shares of the fund are valued at net asset value on a daily basis a complete description of the valuation method

equal to  of the taxable portion of a distribution from certain taxqualified retirement plans however the  penalty tax does not apply to a distributions that is  made on or after the date on which the

his or her designated beneficiary  except in the case of an ira made to an employee after separation from service after reaching age  or  not greater than the amount allowable as a deduction to the employee for eligible medical expenses during the taxable year in addition the  penalty tax does not apply to a distribution from an ira that is  made after separation from employment to an unemployed ira owner for health insurance premiums if certain conditions are met  not in excess of the amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses as defined by section t of the code or  a qualified firsttime homebuyer distribution meeting the requirements specified at section t of the code if you are a participant in a simple ira plan you should be aware that the  penalty tax is increased to

minimum distribution penalty tax if the amount distributed is less than the minimum required distribution for the year the participant is subject to a  penalty tax on the amount that was not properly

beginning date is april  of the calendar year following the later of  the calendar year in which the individual attains age   or  the calendar year in which the individual retires from service with the employer sponsoring the plan the required beginning date for an individual who is a five  percent owner as defined in the code or who is the owner of an ira is april  of the calendar year

determined by dividing the account balance by the applicable life expectancy this account balance is generally based upon the account value as of the close of business on the last day of the previous calendar year in addition minimum distribution incidental benefit rules may require a larger annual distribution if an individual dies before reaching his or her required beginning date the individuals entire interest must generally be distributed within five years of the individuals death however this rule will be deemed satisfied if distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the individuals death to a designated beneficiary and distribution is over the life of such designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the beneficiary if the beneficiary is the individuals surviving spouse distributions may be delayed until the individual would have attained age   if an individual dies after reaching his or her required beginning date or after distributions have commenced the individuals interest must generally be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at the time of the individuals death c withholding in general regular wage withholding rules apply to distributions from iras and plans described in section  of the code periodic distributions from other taxqualified retirement plans that are made for a specified period of  or more years or for the life or life expectancy of the participant or the joint lives or life expectancies of the participant and beneficiary

direct transfer distributions are direct payments to an ira or to another eligible retirement plan under code section a certain states require withholding of state taxes when federal income tax is withheld d diversification of the separate account the code requires that investments supporting your contract be adequately diversified code section  provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified if a contract is not treated as an annuity contract the contract owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value the treasury departments diversification regulations require among other things that  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment  no more than  is represented by any two investments  no more than  is represented by any three investments and  no more than  is represented by any four investments in determining whether the diversification standards are met all securities of the same issuer all interests in the same real property project and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment in the case of government securities each government agency or instrumentality is treated as a separate issuer  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th a separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on the last day of each calendar quarter or within  days after the quarter ends if an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification requirements the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis however either the company or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which the diversification requirements were not met we monitor the diversification of investments in the separate accounts and test for diversification as required by the code we intend to administer all contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will maintain adequate diversification e ownership of the assets in the separate account in order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner it is unclear under what circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets in the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes the irs has issued several rulings discussing investor control these rulings say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner such as the ability to select and control investments in a separate account will cause the contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes in its explanation of the diversification regulations the treasury department recognized that the temporary regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account the explanation further indicates that the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a segregated asset account may include multiple subaccounts but do not specify the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue rulings under section d relating to the definition of variable contract the final regulations issued under section  did not provide guidance regarding investor control and as of the date of this prospectus guidance has yet to be issued we do not know if additional guidance will be issued if guidance is issued we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control there is some uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes we reserve the right to modify the contract as necessary to prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account f contracts owned by nonnatural persons code section  contains provisions for contract owners which are not natural persons nonnatural persons include corporations trusts limited liability companies partnerships and other types of legal entities the tax rules for contracts owned by nonnatural persons are different from the rules for contracts owned by individuals for example the annual net increase in the value of the contract is currently includible in the gross income of a nonnatural person unless the nonnatural person holds the contract as an agent for a natural person there are additional exceptions from current inclusion for  certain annuities held by structured settlement companies  certain annuities held by an employer with respect to a terminated qualified retirement plan and  certain immediate annuities a nonnatural person which is a taxexempt entity for federal tax purposes will not be subject to income tax as a result of this provision if the contract owner is a nonnatural person the primary annuitant is treated as the contract owner in applying mandatory distribution rules these rules require that certain distributions be made upon the death of the contract owner a change in the primary annuitant is also treated as the death of the contract owner g annuity

mortality experience among annuitants after retirement because of the expense and mortality undertakings by hartford in providing an expense undertaking hartford assumes the risk that the deductions for sales expenses the annual maintenance fee and the minimum death benefit during the accumulation period may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of providing such items the mortality undertaking provided by hartford under the contracts assuming the selection of one of the forms of life annuities is to make monthly annuity payments determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the contract to contract owners or annuitants accounts regardless of how long an annuitant may live and regardless of how long all annuitants as a group may live this undertaking assures a contract owner that neither the longevity of an annuitant nor an improvement in life expectancy will have any adverse effect on the monthly annuity payments the employees will receive under the contract it thus relieves the contract owner from the risk that participants in the plan will outlive the funds accumulated the mortality undertaking is based on hartfords actuarial determination of expected mortality rates among all annuitants if actual experience among annuitants deviates from hartfords actuarial determination of expected mortality rates among annuitants because as a group their longevity is longer than anticipated hartford must provide amounts from its general funds to fulfill its contract obligations in that event a loss will fall on hartford
