act into the senate harkin delivered part of a speech in sign language so his deaf brother could understand sen tom harkin speaks at a rally held by the coalition for the advancement of stem cell research harkin has taken issue with the supreme courts handling of a number of cases related to ada concerned that the judgments severely limited the scope of the legislations effectiveness together these cases as handled by the nations highest court have created a supreme absurdity the more successful a person is at coping with a disability the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ada if that is the ruling then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied or that they can be fired—without recourse in order to address these issues harkin proposed the ada amendments act which in his words will restore the proper balance and application of the ada by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability while increasing eligibility for ada protections harkin has also been a vocal critic of what he describes as the biased nature of the medicaid program the current medicaid system is unacceptably biased in favor of institutional care twothirds of medicaid longterm care dollars are spent on institutional services with only onethird going to communitybased care its time to rebalance the system during his political career harkin has generally supported the supreme court ruling roe v wade which decided that a right to privacy under the due process clause

reform legislation he voted for the patient protection and affordable care act in december  and he voted for the health care and education reconciliation act of  politifact rated harkins  claim

prevention stuff is good but it’s just really complicated it doesn’t have to be that complicated” he said of the affordable care act he also believes the new legislation rewards the insurance industry he said important reforms such as preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age  were laudable but he now believes that democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to governmentprovided health insurance in retrospect he believes the democraticcontrolled senate and house should have enacted a singlepayer healthcare system or a public option to give the uninsured access to governmentrun health plans that compete with private insurance companies  his comments about cuban healthcare have been criticized as misrepresenting the availability of quality care israeledit harkin has been a staunch supporter of israel as a member

speech in sign language so his deaf brother could understand sen tom harkin speaks at a rally held by the coalition for the advancement of stem cell research harkin has taken issue with the supreme courts handling of a number of cases related to ada concerned that the judgments severely limited the scope of the legislations effectiveness together these cases as handled by the nations highest court have created a supreme absurdity the more successful a person is at coping with a disability the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ada if that is the ruling then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied or that they can be fired—without recourse in order to address these issues harkin proposed the ada amendments act which in his words will restore the proper balance and application of the ada by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability while increasing eligibility for ada protections harkin has also been a vocal critic of what he describes as the biased nature of the medicaid program the current medicaid system is unacceptably biased in favor of institutional care twothirds of medicaid longterm care dollars are spent on institutional services with only onethird going to communitybased care its time to rebalance the system

losing health insurance coverage false however in  harkin expressed some second thoughts he criticized health reform as being too complex and convoluted “all the prevention stuff is good but it’s just really complicated it doesn’t have to be that complicated” he said of the affordable care act he also believes the new legislation rewards the insurance industry he said important reforms such as preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age  were laudable but he now believes that democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to governmentprovided health insurance in retrospect he believes the democraticcontrolled senate and house should have enacted a singlepayer healthcare system or a public option to give the uninsured access to governmentrun health plans that compete with private insurance companies  his comments about cuban

could understand sen tom harkin speaks at a rally held by the coalition for the advancement of stem cell research harkin has taken issue with the supreme courts handling of a number of cases related to ada concerned that the judgments severely limited the scope of the legislations effectiveness together these cases as handled by the nations highest court have created a supreme absurdity the more successful a person is at coping with a disability the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ada if that is the ruling then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied or that they can be fired—without recourse in order to address these issues harkin proposed the ada amendments act which in his words will restore the proper balance and application of the ada by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability while increasing eligibility for ada protections

complicated” he said of the affordable care act he also believes the new legislation rewards the insurance industry he said important reforms such as preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age  were laudable but he now believes that democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to governmentprovided health insurance in retrospect he believes the democraticcontrolled senate and house should have enacted a singlepayer healthcare system or a public option to give the uninsured access to governmentrun health plans that compete with private insurance companies  his comments about cuban healthcare have been criticized as misrepresenting the

to ada concerned that the judgments severely limited the scope of the legislations effectiveness together these cases as handled by the nations highest court have created a supreme absurdity the more successful a person is at coping with a disability the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ada if that is the ruling then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied or that they can be fired—without recourse in order to address these issues harkin proposed the ada amendments act which in his words will restore the proper balance and application of the ada by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability while increasing eligibility for ada protections

complicated” he said of the affordable care act he also believes the new legislation rewards the insurance industry he said important reforms such as preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age  were laudable but he now believes that democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to governmentprovided health insurance in retrospect he believes the democraticcontrolled senate and house should have enacted a singlepayer healthcare system or a

to ada concerned that the judgments severely limited the scope of the legislations effectiveness together these cases as handled by the nations highest court have created a supreme absurdity the more successful a person is at coping with a disability the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ada if that is the ruling then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied or that they can be fired—without recourse in order to address these issues harkin proposed the ada amendments act which in his words will restore the proper balance and application of the ada by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability while increasing eligibility for ada protections

against people with preexisting conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age  were laudable but he now believes that democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to governmentprovided health insurance in retrospect he believes the democraticcontrolled senate and house should have enacted a singlepayer healthcare system or a

successful a person is at coping with a disability the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ada if that is the ruling then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied or that they can be fired—without recourse in order to address these issues harkin proposed the ada amendments act which in his words will restore the proper balance and application of the ada by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability while increasing eligibility for ada protections

against people with preexisting conditions and keeping young adults on their parents’ health insurance plans until age  were laudable but he now believes that democrats should not have settled for a solution he believes is inferior to governmentprovided health insurance in retrospect he believes the democraticcontrolled senate and house should have enacted a singlepayer healthcare system or a

more cam david gorski on march   share thistweetshare on tumblrmorepocketprintemail senator tom harkin diowa owes me a new irony meter i’ll explain in a minute but first you have to know why i even care about what harkin says or does given that he’s not my senator as you may recall arguably no single legislator in the us has done more to harm to the cause of promoting science and evidencebased medicine than tom harkin that’s because it was primarily through harkin’s efforts that the national institutes of health despite the fact that its scientists were not agitating for it had the national center for complementary and alternative medicine nccam rammed down its throat in  first as the office of alternative medicine oam then in  when nih director harold varmus tried to place oam under more scientific nih control by elevating oam to a full and independent center within the nih thus was nccam born i’ve complained many times about how nccam funds studies that let’s face it are of pseudoscience and quackery homeopathy anyone and even more about how it promotes unscientific medical practices i’ve argued time and time again that there is no research that is funded by nccam that couldn’t be dealt with as well or better by other centers or institutes within the nih i’ve even argued that nccam should be defunded and dismantled allowing cam grant applications to be evaluated by the most appropriate center as has our fearless leader steve novella most vociferous of all has been my fellow sbm blogger kimball atwood who has made similar arguments at even greater length i’ve also pointed out harkin and other camfriendly legislators created and managed to increase the funding of nccam to the tune of  million a year not for the purpose of rigorous scientific evaluation of cam practices but rather to promote cam and ultimately “integrate” it with scientific medicine at this they have been enormously successful let me clarify what i meant is that nccam along with the bravewell collaborative has been very successful in popularizing cam in medical academia at “proving” that cam works not so much evidence that this is so comes from a recent observation that senator tom harkin is very very unhappy with nccam these days and has publicly said so recently as pointed out by lindsay beyerstein daughter of the late great skeptical psychologist barry beyerstein on thursday harkin told a senate panel integrative care a pathway to a healthier nation that he was disappointed that nccam had disproven too many alternative therapies his remarks begin about  minutes into the video on the webpage to which i linked in addition harkin’s statements have also been posted to his senate blog “i am pleased to cochair this morning’s hearing with senator mikulski and i am eager to hear our distinguished witnesses’ ideas on using integrative care to keep people healthy improve healthcare outcomes and reduce healthcare costs “it is fashionable these days to quote abraham lincoln so i would like to quote from his  address to congress – words that should inspire us as we craft health care reform legislation lincoln said “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty     as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country” “clearly the time has come to “think anew” and to “disenthrall ourselves” from the dogmas and biases that have made our current health care system – based overwhelmingly on conventional medicine – in so many ways wasteful and dysfunctional i note that on the video harkin does not say “conventional medicine” in fact he says “conventional allopathic medicine” and as any regular reader of this blog knows anyone who uses the term “allopathic” in such a contemptuous manner to describe conventional scientific medicine has clearly drunk the kool aid but consistent with how i’ve warned that cam advocates would do their best to hijack any effort on the part of the obama administration to reform the health care system by trying to link all manner of unscientific woo to “prevention” harkin goes on to do just that it is time to end the discrimination against alternative health care practices “it is time for america’s health care system to emphasize coordination and continuity of care patientcenteredness and prevention “and it is time to adopt an integrative approach that takes advantage of the very best scientifically based medicines and therapies whether conventional or alternative “this is about giving people the pragmatic alternatives they want while ending discrimination against practitioners of scientifically based alternative health care it is about improving health care outcomes and yes it is about reducing health care costs generally speaking alternative therapies are less expensive and less intrusive – and we need to take advantage of that note the false dichotomy it is not necessary to embrace pseudoscience in order to reform the health care system to emphasize “coordination continuity of care and prevention” nor i would argue is it necessary to use placebo medicine as a coequal to scientific medicine in order to reduce costs unless of course your goal is to reduce costs by not treating patients adequately and let’s face it placebo medicine is what the vast majority of the hodgepodge of unscientific and pseudoscientific practices that fall under the rubric of cam are most tellingly harkins makes the agenda of cam advocates to hijack health care reform in order to get their foot in the door as “preventative” medicine as plain as can be exactly as i described recently harkins first prefaces his remarks by explaining how he decided he wanted to write the legislation that brought into existence the oam and later nccam not surprisingly it was based on an anecdote about a friend of his from the house of representatives who had a serious illness tried “alternative” approaches and supposedly got better then harkins makes a startling admission one of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches quite frankly i must say publicly that it has fallen short it think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving note what harkin first says here he doesn’t say that the purpose of nccam was to investigate alternative approaches and determine if they work or not regardless of what the results turned out to be rather he states plainly that the purpose of nccam was to investigate and validate alternative approaches his concept for nccam is that it would prove that his favored woo works that’s why he’s so disappointed that the vast majority of the studies coming out of nccam are actually negative moreover he clearly doesn’t understand how science works hypothesis testing involves designing experiments or clinical trials that can be falsified ie “disproved” if an experiment or clinical trial can’t falsify the hypothesis that is being tested then it is not really science falsification attempting to disprove the hypothesis is at the heart of how the scientific method works but tom harkin does not want nccam to work by the scientific method not really he has claimed that he does but his statements above make it very clear that he only likes the scientific method when its results are what he wants them to be under nccam many studies have been performed by believers under conditions quite favorable to producing apparently “positive results” yet few and far between are any results resembling anything postive when it comes to nccamfunded studies and they’re firtually nonexistent for studies funded by nccam for the major favored cam modalities such as “energy healing” acupuncture therapeutic touch only studies of herbs produce positive results and such studies are nothing more than pharmacognosy which could be done in virtually any institute depending upon what natural product is being studied a special center for herbalism is not needed and all the other cam practices have by and large failed to stand up to even the favorable scrutiny of nccamfunded studies in any case now senator harkin is unhappy because nccam isn’t proving what he wants it to prove so what’s his new strategy why to “integrate” these therapies that have failed thus far to stand up to scientific scrutiny with scientific medicine in fact he makes it very clear that he plans on yoking any health care reform that president obama tries to pass through the congress to the addition of integrative medicine since  the field has evolved and matured today we are not just talking about alternative practices but also the integration between conventional and alternative therapies in order to achieve truly integrative health we need to have practitioners talking with each other collaborating to treat the whole person and this is the model we intend to build into our health care reform bill on several occasions i have laid down a public marker saying that if we pass a bill that greatly extends health insurance coverage but does nothing to create a dramatically stronger prevention and public health infrastructure and agenda then we will have failed the american people well this morning i want to lay down a second marker if we fail to seize this unique opportunity to adopt a pragmatic integrative approach to health care then that too would constitute a serious failure that my dear readers is what we are dealing with a very powerful senior senator invites “luminaries” of the cam movement to testify in front of his senate committee and states openly that he will consider any health care reform that doesn’t include “integrative medicine” to be a failure funny but as an advocate of science and evidencebased medicine i would consider a health care reform package that does include the integration of unproven health care modalities many of which are based on a prescientific understanding of illness with science and evidencebased medicine to be a catastrophic failure of health care reform i encourage our readers particularly the ones who are registered voters in iowa to comment on senator harkin’s statement using the link at the bottom of his
