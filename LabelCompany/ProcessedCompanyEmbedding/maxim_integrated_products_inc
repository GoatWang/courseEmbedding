afternoon to all our participants thank you for joining us on our call and as always we appreciate your interest in maxim integrated the june quarter marked the third consecutive quarter in our return to yearoveryear growth led by double digit increases in industrial and automotive through solid execution in our manufacturing strategy we exceeded our profitability targets and demonstrated strong earnings power and cash flow growth today we are announcing a  increase in our dividend reflecting our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders and confidence in our longterm outlook let me now discuss our business i would like to highlight that my end market commentary on the june quarter does not include revenue from the transition to sell in accounting at one distributor for details on the growth rates by end market please refer to our earnings presentation in our website first i will comment on automotive as we expected our automotive business was flat from a strong march quarter and grew in double digits from the same quarter of the last year in the near term considering a relatively soft environment we are forecasting our september quarter growth rate to be up in the low teens from the same quarter last year given the softness seen broadly across automotive markets for the second consecutive quarter we believe it is prudent to assume a low teens yearoveryear growth rate for this business we remain highly confident in the longterm fundamentals of our automotive business and believe we are in the early innings in the electronification of cars the industry is driving the need for advanced vision systems in multiple additional sensors deployed in cars for advanced driver assistance and eventually fully autonomous cars data from these sensors must be transported within vehicles at high speed and with very low latency our serial link technology and products fulfill these requirements the rapid expansion of driver data needs more processors which in turns requires more sophisticated power management at core competency of maxim additionally the movement toward stricter air quality standards in cities drives unit sales increases the electric vehicles we chose maxims differentiated battery management products we haven’t increased our rd efforts in all of these areas and continue to expand our pipeline of designed wins let me next turn to the industrial market our june quarter industrial business was up sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter last year within industrial the core segment led the growth for the fifth consecutive quarter driven by factory automation products and by progress we have made in our broad market initiatives we achieved strong growth in the june quarter even when factoring out the sell in accounting transaction in the september quarter we expect industrial to be seasonally down sequentially and strongly up from the same quarter of last year the factory indiscernible recognized our factory automation products enabled direct network access to sensors and actuators on the factory floor this allows manufacturers to implement on the fly robot tooling changes and more flexible manufacturing work streams maxims technology enables factory upgrades by using existing wiring and this is highly valued by end users distributed architecture of modern factories also requires smaller form factor power management which is a core competency of maxim we see revenue growth in all of these areas and believe were still in the early days with factory modernization we estimate that the total installed base of sensors and actuators that uses modern factory controlled systems is still in the low single digit percentage let me now turn to our broad market business then outline some of the recent successes we have had with our distribution partner strategy first we have continued to upgrade our technical collateral and improve our online support and website storefront making it easier for customers to find information on our products second were increasing the use of analytics to identify track and maximize the value opportunities within the broad market and third we continue to expand our distribution channel partnerships in the fiscal year we added four new distribution partners to extend our customer reach in the americas europe china and the rest of asia all of these new distribution partners employ expert field application support to help our customers solve problems creating demand for maxim products we have begun to see positive results from these improvements in fiscal  we increased our resales to customers in the small medium business category by  over the prior year fiscal  was also a record year for resales in the distribution channel where we exceeded our goal of  billion in the june quarter our combined distribution channel comprised  of maxim revenue excluding the transition to sell in accounting at one distributor  was the highest level for the company over the last decade we believe there are multiple indiscernible ahead in achieving profitable growth in the broad market as we execute our strategy together automotive and industrial markets contributed  of total company revenue in the june quarter let me next discuss communications and data center in the june quarter communications and data center was flat sequentially and up from the same quarter last year growth in the same market was again led by data center with strong customer adoption of our g optical products used in high speed applications within the data center in the june quarter communications infrastructure was down sequentially and down from the same quarter last year we expect continued momentum in g optical products as data rate requirements increased and customer capex for cloud data centers increases at a  growth rate in the september quarter we expect the communications infrastructure market to be broadly down sequentially finally let me turn to consumer in the june quarter our consumer business was sequentially flat with lower shipments indiscernible than expected and improved diversification and wearables gaming and peripherals in the september quarter we expect consumer to be up sequentially with continued growth in wearables tablets peripherals and gaming products during the quarter we achieved multiple new design wins with our small form factor power management and audio products across a variety of consumer wearables hearables and smart home assistance keys to our differentiation include high accuracy fuel gauging for batteries always on capability and highly efficient and power management ics and boosted sound quality with our audio products these wins are evidence that our broad market strategy in consumer is working leveraging our differentiated ip across multiple customers and platforms in closing our performance demonstrates that our strategy to grow revenue in our focused markets is working we are growing automotive factory automation and g optical datacenter in the double digits from the same quarter last year and we are starting to see new growth in our broad market business as a result of our distribution partnership initiatives and to improve reach to small medium business customers our efficient manufacturing structure combined with our return to revenue growth is enabling us to exceed our profitability and cash flow goals we remain committed to maximize shareholder value and to lead in the return of capital to shareholders as evidenced by todays announced dividend increase of  with that ill now turn the call over to bruce for the numbers bruce kiddoo thanks tunc overall we continue to successfully execute on our business transformation our fourth quarter gross margin of  exceeded the high end of our guidance range and operating margin at  was the highest level in over a decade revenue in the fourth quarter was up from the same period a year ago and we are guiding the first quarter to be another growth quarter for maxim our return to growth operational efficiency and world class profitability gives us confidence to increase our quarterly dividend by  and establish a new share repurchase authorization of  billion we remain highly committed to our leadership and the return of capitals to our shareholders with that let me discuss our fourth quarter financial results revenue for the fourth quarter was  million up  from the third quarter and up  from the same quarter a year ago fourth quarter results include approximately  million of revenue for the transitions of selling revenue accounting from one distributor split roughly  industrial  comp  consumer and  each auto and computing revenues grew sequentially and yearoveryear even when excluding this benefit our revenue mix by major markets in q was approximately  from industrial  consumer  comp and datacenter  automotive and  computing its worth highlighting that industrial plus automotive is nearly  of total company revenue up from  three years ago when we began breaking out our automotive business let me now turn to the distribution channel distribution comprised  of maxims revenue in the june quarter retails in q were strongly up sequentially we ended q with  days of inventory in the channel down two days from q the decrease in days was driven by strong retail and tight inventory management turning to the pl maxims gross margin excluding special items was  an increase of  basis points from the prior quarter driven by strong operational execution on our manufacturing transformation and a modest benefit from the transition of selling revenue accounting in q special items in q gross margin included intangible asset amortization from acquisitions operating expenses excluding special items were  million up slightly from the prior quarter due to higher employee profit sharing special items in q operating expenses included acquisition related charges and restructuring charges q gaap operating income including special items with  million operating margin at  of revenue is up  basis points from prior quarter and up  basis points from the same quarter a year ago the improvement in operating margin was driven by our manufacturing transformation and focused rd investment strategy q gaap tax rate excluding special items was  gaap earnings per share excluding special items was  just above the midpoint of our guided range and up  from the same quarter a year ago turning to the balance sheet and cash flow during the quarter cash flow from operations was  million or  of revenue inventory days ended at  up five days from q inventory dollars were up  from the prior quarter gross capital expenditures were  million in the quarter offset by  million in proceeds from sale of property capital expenditures are well below depreciation of  million per quarter trailing  months free cash flow ending in q using net capital expenditures was  million or  of revenue and up  over the same quarter last year our free cash flow yield is approximately  at yesterday’s closing stock price for capital returned share repurchases totaled  million in q as we bought back approximately  million shares dividends totaled  million in the quarter or  per share the current dividend yield is approximately  at yesterday’s closing stock price reflecting the dividend increase as i mentioned in my opening remarks maxims board of directors has approved a  increase in the quarterly dividend to  per share and a new share repurchase authorization of  billion the prior authorization was nearly consumed and is replaced with this new authorization we expect buybacks to be consistent with our annual commitment to return  of free cash flow to shareholders in the fourth quarter we completed an offering of senior notes with an aggregate principal of  million the notes carry a coupon rate of  and are due in  the proceeds of this offering will be used for general corporate purposes overall total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased by  million in the fourth quarter to  billion moving on to guidance our beginning q backlog was  million based on this beginning backlog and expected turns we forecast q revenue of  million to  million excluding approximately  million of revenue from the sellin transition in q q revenues are expected to be roughly flat sequentially compared to the same quarter last year q revenues are expected to be up driven by contact growth in automotive and industrial we expect the final transition to sellin accounting to occur in q at a similar level to q q gross margin excluding special items is forecasted at  to  reflecting continued execution of our manufacturing transformation and without the benefit of the transition to sellin and revenue accounting in q special items in q gross margin are estimated at approximately  million primarily for amortization of intangible assets q operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be flat for the prior quarter with continued cost controls offsetting the impact of our annual compensation review special items in q operating expenses are estimated at approximately  million primarily for amortization of intangible assets our cash rate for q excluding special items will be  flat from q we expect this rate to be applicable for all of fiscal year  for q gaap earnings per share excluding special items we expect a range of  to  in summary we expect continued growth in q revenue compared to the same quarter last year we are growing content in automotive and industrial and diversifying our revenue and consumer which is helping to lower variability and we can continue to exceed our profitability and free cash flow targets which gives us confidence to increase our return of cash to shareholders and with that ill turn the call over to kathy kathy ta thanks bruce that concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for questions we would like to continue the same qa process as we used in previous quarters well take one question from each caller so we can get some more people in the queue and if you have more than one question please get back into the queue jonathan could we please have our first question questionandanswer session operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from the line of harlan sur from jpmorgan your question please harlan sur good afternoon and congratulations on the strong free cash flow generation and dividend rates in automotive you know backlogged earnings cost i think the team was relatively confident about getting back to kind of high teens year over year growth in automotive obviously based on the guidance and the commentary looks like you guys are still going to be trending kind of low teens year over year growth this quarter i know that auto is typically seasonally weaker in september but i guess after the weak june quarter we thought you could at least hold this segment flat sequentially tunc you know you talked about some of the weaker trends kind of broadly can you just kind of help us understand how much of the sequential decline in this quarter is due to continued weakness in china bms and how much of the weakness is due to sort of other geographies and in your view is this consistent with sort of the overall slowdown in global stars or maybe more of a slowdown in some of the maxim specific product cycles tunc doluca harlan so ill take that one i think you addressed it to me anyway so you know last quarter we did give this low single digit growth year over year for that business we were coming from a strong march quarter double digit growth for that business and we were coming from a really strong march quarter so it wasnt quite clear to us in terms of whether you know that was going to be a lasting effect or not but since this is the second quarter where were seeing that type of demand from our customers it seemed prudent that we really should change and be looking forward reflect that were going to be growing in the low doubledigits this quarter again yearoveryear the question is to whether  what are the underlying factors are in that it actually is very difficult for us to see that we do as you know a vast majority of that business goes through our tier s and when our product ends up in tier  they get shift to automotive customers or end customers that are in multiple regions and then multiple types of cars so our visibility into exactly whats happening in terms of market directions for car unit sales is not very good and i think we all read what everybody else sees and everybody else reads and were going to make those comments last quarter but now i realize that its probably better for us to just tell you what we see from our viewpoint and trying to read into what that all means for local automotive markets or general trends is actually i dont think was the right thing to do so we decided that well give the color as we see it for the demand for our products but really not try to extend it to what that means for the automotive or the car market in general so im not going to be very helpful in that case but we really dont have the visibility because were kind of two sets removed ph from the end market demand operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of vivek arya from bank of america merrill lynch your question please unidentified analyst hi guys this is indiscernible dialing in for vivek thanks for taking my question my question is on your consumer business which appears to be decelerating im sorry declining a little bit faster than perhaps you expected whats the right way to think about this moving forward for next year can you maybe give us some clarification on what your remaining exposure is to your largest customer and what are the trends are outside of that largest customer bruce kiddoo if you look at it in the fourth quarter our consumer business overall was flat sequentially and when we look at it in the september quarter we see that it was  we were guiding that to be up overall i would say the dynamic thats happening there is we see weakness in smartphones when we look at the q results the one area that came in under expectations was smartphones and when we look at the q guidance we guided smartphones flat basically all the other businesses are doing veryvery well if you look at sort of our tablets business our wearable business our gaming business they were all up strongly yearoveryear in q and were guiding them all to be up strongly against yearoveryear in q so our strategy around diversification within consumer is working obviously theres sort of the transition from smartphones to a more broader based consumer business and i think were kind of in that transitional period right now but overall were long term as the kind of the smartphone business becomes a smaller part of our business and i think last quarter us it was at up half of our consumer business which has been coming down significantly over prior years and we have no customer over  and our largest customer actually went down sequentially from q to q so even further reducing our exposure to that customer so i think overall we feel good about kind of the progress we have made on diversification and its really selling our products to multiple customers across multiple platforms audio gap whether its power audio or centers operator our next question comes from the line ross seymore from deutsche bank your question please ross seymore i want to bring it up to a little bit of higher level beyond just the auto or the consumer side and just tunc or bruce just talk a little bit about where you think we are in the cycle this last quarter you had the guidance for june and the automotive news kind of spooked people in cyclical concerns and frankly your revenue guidance  your revenue report missed the midpoint in june and is below the street for september so you can just talk a little bit about why those numbers are a little bit lower and where you think we are in the cycle that would be great bruce kiddoo ill take the first crack at that and then ill give some quantitative and then let tunc give a little color on that i think when we looked at q and sort of as i mentioned the miss was all actually in smartphones everything else kind of came is as expected and on the smartphone side basically we guided to either what our customers told us or in some cases even discounted it to a certain extent and yet the actual result came in below that but everything else when we look at  our industrial business it came in strong even if you take out the effective dgt industrial is up  yearoveryear so that came in very strong and we feel good about that business the comps and data center was flat but up  yearoveryear and of course automotive up double digits as well so i think the q i think its less of a cyclical issue and i think it’s more just smartphones in both korea and china being a little bit weak when we look to q certainly i think the biggest impact is in the automotive we are guiding it down at down  or something like that when its normally seasonally flat i don’t think that’s a big deal but as harlan said i think there was an expectation that maybe there will be a little bit stronger bounce back and i think we felt that as well but assumes ph said now that we had two quarters kind of low teens demand and that’s what our customers are telling us so we think its just probably the right thing to reflect that when we look at industrial its again a couple of points seasonally down yearoveryear its still up double digits and so everything that’s happening in the industrial side we feel good about tuncs kind of commented a little bit on the broad market and then i would say the other thing that’s a little bit weaker than we thought for q right now is the comp infrastructure business we don’t have good visibility into that and when we look at that market and our guide there we clearly see the infrastructure side being weak we still see good growth in the optical side and the data center side so we feel good about there but as most people know if you look at our common data center its about twothirds infrastructure onethird data center and that twothirds infrastructure is certainly weaker than what we thought i dont know tunc if i i said a lot tunc doluca thats right i think bruce did a pretty good job but just to summarize the quarter that distended except for consumer came in just as we expected so that was good and if you look at our markets if you look at year over year numbers the quarter were in currently that ends in september weve got good doubledigit growth in both industrials and in automotive which we look forward to there is also growth in comps and data centers its more modest in the first two so thats all good and there is weakness in consumers for the reasons that bruce is just outlined so there are always puts and takes in the business but in general its going in the direction that we expected and if you look at all the measures that we put in place all the investments that were making in rd weve got even more confidence that were doing it in the right places in the company so from that due point despite the very small coming onto what we expected in the last quarter we feel good about the business operator thank you our next question comes from the line of tore svanberg from stifel your question please tore svanberg yes a followup to ross question and not to hatch too much on the cyclicality aspect but can you talk a little bit about where your lead times what youre seeing as far as customer behavior are they kind of ordering two demands if you could just help us a bit on on that that would be great tunc doluca so first of all i think that if you just look at our numbers and my comments about or about us im not trying to say things about the industry in general the data that we see is our customer ordered lead times has gone up a bit theyve gone in the last six months theyve extended by an additional week this is what lead times theyre giving to us our ability to deliver has not changed we call this our capability to deliver to customer orders thats actually maybe even come down slightly in the last six months or so so from our view point we dont have a capacity limitation were not seeing anything thats unusual for us there are few areas where there is some tightness like raw wafer supply and some packaging but its pretty small and thats not something that we were concerning with or is limiting our capabilities with the products to customers so on the maxim front the things would normal operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ambrish srivastava from bmo your question please ambrish srivastava i actually wanted to focus a little bit on the gross margin side bruce and i apologize if you already gave it the impact from sellin has to be pretty tiny and longer term my question was youre inching up toward that if i call it the hollowed linear risks although linear was much higher in that drain so whats the right way to think about the business bruce longer term what can maxim generate on the gross margin front then what are the levers thank you bruce kiddoo yes i think we were very pleased with kind of the results this quarter at  and there may have been or there probably was point benefit from the accounting transitions and thats why we guided to the  kind a midpoint for the september quarter certainly above probably the most people were expecting that to be and i think we continue to see sort of momentum from our manufacturing transformation most of those activities have been completed at this point in time but sort of the tailwind as a result of that whether thats continuing to kind a maximize the loading in our remaining oregon fab as our takeorpay comes down at the towerjazz at san antonio fab whether thats the kind of the gap between depreciation at  million and capex at sort of kind of  of revenue and that sort of in the lowteens of  million and so over a multiple year i think that will provide a tailwind for gross margin just to move into kind of pushing distribution pushing smd industrial growing i think thats a tailwind all of those things have whats allowed us to kind of every quarter do a little bit better than what we thought now at some point right that sort of kind of reaches equilibrium that something were looking at and i think when we get some comfort in that whether thats at an investor day or at the appropriate time well share a new model but for now were just pushing as hard as we can to continue to maximize gross margin maximize the profitability for the company and not be limited by a target at this point so we feel good about the results well continue to push and we think there is a lots of or several tailwinds that working in our direction operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of christopher rolland from susquehanna your question please christopher rolland so distribution  i think you said the highest ever and you guys mentioned some changes that youre making in pushing distribution perhaps if you can remind us what some of those changes are and then also how much do you think youre benefiting here from guys like ti going more direct and guys like adi going exclusive with one just the  how much of this do you attribute to competitive changes in the tail tunc doluca yes so in terms of what are we doing or what initiatives do we have to drive more sales through that channel i gave some brief summary in the opening remarks but in essence weve gotten better at making sure that our products have better collateral for our customers thrilled to design them in more easily we made some improvements in actually how they can get parts from us from our website and that should be helping because it makes the look what was the desistence to use the product so thats number one so i just put that under the collateral header the other thing we’ve done is we’ve gotten better of using analytics for following up on lease people that have asked for samples people that have done any kind of inquiry on anything we’ve got that analysts helping in get more customers to use our products rather in our competitors and finally i mean unlike some of the other competitors we got we actually are expanding our distribution which is really important we see as i said we’ve added distributors four more distributors in various regions and we find that these distributors are highly confident in their field application support and in analog that is really important that’s really how you win designs and that’s going to be beneficial to us in terms of winning more business so those are the things that we’ve done we’ve taken action onto increase our designing win ratio of course competitors are doing other things they’ve got their own plans and they’re pushing in that direction it’s really very difficult to figure out whether we’re winning because of that or because of what we’re doing but we’ll take it any way it comes and i think that we believe that with the total number of customers we’re trying to serve trying to do that alone is not a strategy that we work for maxim so that’s why we need our distribution partners and we’ll continue pushing in terms of our strategy going forward operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john pitzer from credit suisse your question please john pitzer i just kind of want to follow up to ross question notwithstanding all the good work and execution on profitability when you look at revenue growth for maxim even though the absolute yearoveryear growth is decent it still seems that you’re kind of significantly underperforming peers even when you normalize for the transformation you’ve had in the consumer market and the diversification away from your largest customer there and so i’m kind of curious can you help me understand do you guys look at relative growth rates as a comparable metric and on that basis do you feel as you’re keeping up with peers and i guess importantly as we go forward what areas of your ip do you think you can really leverage to drive better than sort of industry average growth tunc doluca yes so that settles like a complete investor day presentation required but i’ll do my best  ill do my best john so we did share a couple of years ago how we decided to change general strategy we have been investing in areas where we saw great potential for us to be do better than our competitors leveraging our strength leveraging our brand leveraging our design expertise in certain areas so that ended up in us really investing in some key areas and those where the one that we shared with you at investor day obviously automotive is one of those that we heavily invest in and we have great products and great technology in power management both for infotainment and for driver assisttype applications we have great technology and products for driver assistance serial links to move vast amounts of data were a significant supplied already for both infotainment now but in the long run in driver assist we’ve investments in battery management products because i think you know electric cars or these hydroelectric cars are going to keep growing because of various reasons so those are areas where in automotive where we have great technology and at least from our vantage point an advantage over the competitors to be able to grow the other area we talked about was industrial and a lot of factory automation weve been investing in that very heavily in my prepared remarks i talked about why the customers want to use our products both in power and in the interface type products and industrial control and automation so thats another area where we believe we have a unfair advantage so to speak and then finally in communications and data center its really putting  we put a lot of effort into g inside the data center optical communications and those are beginning to really ramp in fact if you look at our data center business i was looking at this number just as the call was starting you know yearoveryear it’s grown almost close to  so those are big numbers in the areas that we decided to invest and some of those are smaller than the overall major markets but theyre getting bigger just like automotive it was  or  you know fourfive years now it’s big and i think that were going to see similar effects in all of these areas that were investing in and on top of that we’ve made some changes in our ability to reach the broader customer base we call these our core products and thats beginning to show effect as well so all of these things were doing i think theyre great for future growth but growth is never a straight line bruce and i was talking about this you go through some  you do go through some ups and downs that you didn’t expect having said all that you did ask about how were doing against our competitors we do look at those numbers and what we usually find is theres some circumstances that apply to some and to others they dont so it kind of makes it very difficult to make a very good comparison between us and specially since some of most who dont really report by market as well so it makes it very difficult but absolutely we do look at how were doing and look at our own performance relative to that but in general you know the strategy that i just tried to summarize in a few minutes here i think were seeing it being very effective in those areas that we’re investing in are doing very well bruce kiddoo and john this is bruce just to put some numbers around this right i think we talked about industrial being up q and is guided up in q double digits automotive up in q and in q comps and data center on a year over year basis both in q and q and there as the data centers up and a little bit of weakness in comp the big area that i would say is holding us down right now has been our exposure to smartphones weve been diversifying away from that were not  you know that business is still declining and so when you look at a yearoveryear basis smartphones are down substantially   now its  of our revenue at this point   of revenue so its become a much smaller number from where it was historically and so as we continue to grow the other parts of the business and as tunc said as they become a much bigger part of our business that impact from smartphones will be lesserandlesser going forward and were very confident in sort of the markets weve picked to invest and on a yearoveryear basis we just have to kind of get over the kind of the comps of the smartphones but were confident we made the right decision and that long term this is the company that should be able to grow or exceed the marketplace operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris danley from citigroup your question please chris danley i guess this is the second quarter in a row where gross margins are reasonably above the longterm target but the sales growth is little disappointing so youre guys i guess actively looking to get out some lower margin businesses and if this keeps up if we go through another quarter or two of nice really nice gross margin but a little bit disappointing revenue growth would you look to  could you look to trade off some margin for revenue growth is that possible tunc doluca well i think from a strategy standpoint on each decision we make whether we want to take a business or not we look at the overall margin the defensibility of the socket and so on and i think were in a right balance and i think that we will update you soon in the future after weve got a little more confidence on what our margin targets are going to be but i think our focus really is to deliver the right amount of growing cash flow but our focus is to really remain a differentiated company which means higher margins then our competitors or most of them in any case so those decisions are made every day in the company but i think that in general just saying that were going to lower margins to grow revenue could be a dangerous path to follow so were very careful about that we do have a mix of businesses i think weve explained this in the past not every  theres no bar but on in general weve an overall margin goal for the company some businesses are little slightly below that some are above that but we like to higher margin approach for maxim operator thank you our next question comes from the line of amit daryanani from rbc capital markets your question please amit daryanani i guess just on the industrial segment you saw some really good growth i think was up  in june youre guiding it up nicely in september as well whats your comfort level or how do you get comforted that this is where you all end market driven versus perhaps your customers just decided to hold onto more inventory given what they might read in papers or might be worried about is there a way to think about how much is it good you think that industrial is really end market driven versus perhaps your customers holding more inventory themselves bruce kiddoo so ill answer the inventory side and tunc can talk about the secular growth drivers from an inventory of the best  we cant see where the  siemens or our largest customers are holding but to the extent that almost half our business now is through distribution and the big part of that is industrial actually the channel inventory actually went down from  days down to  days so we actually saw a decline and we had very strong resales that wasn’t just us not shipping less into the channel it was  resales were actually up  quarteroverquarter and we are actually up  yearoveryear and so that’s end demand that’s not building inventory so i think  and i look at the retail data there was strength china japan europe taiwan all up very strong quarteroverquarter we had some weakness in the us we have talked about that before as far as kind of strengthening our position within the us market and we brought on a new distributor in the quarter to further our improvements there so overall i mean when i look at for the channel inventory when i look at which is down i look at resales which were strongly up i mean being up  quarteroverquarter when the normal seasonality is up three that gives me confidence that this is end customer demand that’s driving this growth tunc doluca yes so i think that just to give a little bit more color on all that we are seeing strong growth as i said in the factory automation segment those are really a lot of upgrades from using our products to existing factories we are not hearing from customers that there is they have a what i would call a concern about supply at least from us so there shouldn’t really not be a reason for them to hold a lot of maxim product whereas bruce as very clearly said we don’t have visibility into what the end customers are holding as inventory having said that weve seen seeing good growth in many of these products because the new cycles the new technologies and they like that from our customers and we also saw both growth in the core industrial business from the yearoveryear basis as well as from our verticals so those are all  we see them as good signs and we are not getting any at least verbal mentions that customers that filing maxim product for any concern they said to previous answer that i gave we are telling them that our capability to deliver products is better now than it was six months ago so they don’t see why they would be doing that if they do it because their concern was other people then we wouldn’t be able to see through that and be able to understand that operator our next question comes from the line of william stein of suntrust your question please william stein thanks for taking my question and in the sense with the opposite of the last question and its essentially this that we have read in the press and also heard from channel checks that the shortages in passives and commodities semis have been getting worse and i think we all understand that your customers need complete kits in order to ship systems i wonder if the shortages in passives and commodities are capping the rate of demand that wed other see on maxim tunc doluca yes maybe youre right it is the opposite of the previous question ill be honest with you wed not be able to project that any way because this is not information that they share with us that they have shortages on something else unless its a very large customer that will tell us but i have read and heard about similar things but obviously we neither sell passive and commodities products so its hard for us to see that operator thank you our next question is a followup from the line of ross seymore from deutsche bank your question please ross seymore bruce youd mentioned in your script about another one of the selling revenue recognition dynamic hitting you give in the fiscal second quarter can you give us a little more color on that please bruce kiddoo sure we have one distributor left in north america who is still on sellthrough basis were making this transition before any change in the accounting standard so weve to kind of follow the existing accounting rules i mean doing that we have to have the capability of estimating any recurrence whether thats pricing credits or returns from that distributor and so i think our belief is now that distributor has begun to kind of stabilize their erp system and that will be able to make that transition into two thats kind of internal plan of records we expected to be kind of similar dollar amount as what occurred in q and then we also will probably have sort of similar mix by end market as well so and just to be clear to everybody sometimes people think well this is sort of special or onetime this is  if you think weve have  days of inventory in the channel this is the product that were shipped in fy  that was probably shipped in  will be shipped into the channel in the first quarter that still  that is fitting in inventory that  got of accelerate the reorganization of that revenue but it was raw revenue raw cost occurred in fy  half  and then fy  and then want to just recognize that in the second quarter ross seymore is the duration of that simply one quarter similar to this one where you then go down in fiscal q or because the size of avnet is potentially a longer duration bruce kiddoo now we will get it done in one quarter operator our next question comes from the line of craig hettenbach from morgan stanley your question please craig hettenbach just want to follow up on the comments around comm infrastructure and i know some of the kind of the legacy business but any additional color you can add in terms maybe what you seen by geography or kind of demand versus inventory tunc doluca yes i think its going to be difficult to add much in terms of whats going on comm infrastructure i know and bruce has some information he is looking into his charts in front of him there is not much were going to be able to add as to where were seeing this weakness in the infrastructure side bruce kiddoo i mean i think as you know we dont have strategic sockets where we basically just sell sort of legacy products for the most part into the infrastructure side of the business so were never a good one unfortunately to provide any unique insights clearly we are seeing when i look at those markets pretty much across the board whether its kind of the wired wireless side were seeing sequential declines in that business in q kathy ta thanks craig jonathan i think we have time of just one more questions operator certainly our final question comes from the line of cj muse from evercore your question please cj muse yes hi thanks for squeezing me in i guess the question on the consumer business can you talk to what kind of sequential growth youre expecting there it looks like youre better than your overall guide roughly  and then i guess also now that handset exposures have been reduced how should we think about seasonality into q q as reduced handset and i guess greater exposure elsewhere thank you bruce kiddoo sure i mean we guided consumer up which most people have a little decoder table somewhere which up usually means kind a low single digit and it above to get midtohigh single digits and well say strong up and so in general you can think this as kind a low midsingle digit growth rate for the consumer business as we said cellphones are going to be flat and on a sequential and yearoveryear both the tablets and wearables and gaming are all up strongly and so we feel good about that i think as far as seasonality goes i think its now that were probably diversified i think there will be kind of the less defined we used to thought of if we equated us with samsung and kind of the timing of their product launches and their inventory corrections were seeing less of that i mean a good example is our opportunity at a large japanese gaming company where weve seeing good growth from that both sort of in the first half of the year and continuing into the september quarter so i think were going to become as we become more broadly diversified hopefully it becomes more just a consistent business for us and less product cycle driven kathy ta well thank you cj so jonathan i think that was our last question so id like to wrap up the call that concludes

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
