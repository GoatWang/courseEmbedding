john oddo linda ederover the years the world got so used to linda eders glowing interpretations of broadway standardsand her keen ability to carry on the grand traditions of judy garland and barbra streisandthat any deviation might have been seen as risky or crazy but the truth is as the singer puts it this isnt so much a departure as it is me getting back to who i really am the colorful mix of material from the rousing gospelinfluenced back to life by superstar pop songwriter kara dioguardi to eders own explosive very personal bluesrocker waiting for the fall and loose and highspirited arrangements reflect the kind of music that moved her as a child when she first started playing the guitar and writing songs musically she and producer billy jay stein back up with great integrity and passion her assertion that stepping into the ballgown and singing standards is like playing a role while this rootsy music is more natural for her although the album was released by the great jazz label verve songs like the uptempo country jam pieces the jangling prayer for love and the largely acoustic ballad if you believe the way i do would find a joyful home on mainstream country radio

product ratings           most relevant reviews by deleted oct   linda shows her hiding face i have to say i really enjoyed listening to this cd i discover linda eder some years ago and as every listener i suppose was used to her standards his cd is so much different she does no longer show her technique or power range but takes a soft countrier style that remains the entire album casually this may be the only problem i found on this record songs could sound a bit similar the first times but after listening to them deeply you will discover each one is much more different than the rest x previous image next image   by madackitty oct   simple easy  realistic lyricssomething for ever linda ederthe other side of me this cd was just released on september  and this is her th cd she has appeared on broadway and has sung at carnegie hall she started her singing career in  and has been going strong ever since although she only wrote one song on the cd“waiting for the fall” she does plan on writing more in the future “the other side of me” has a hint of country the lyrics are simple easy to understand and realistic her voice reminds me of a cross of sugarland and melissa ethridge minus the gravel my favorite song is pieces which is about being over someone having had enough of them and not picking up the pieces anymore so is a very nice twist most of the songs are easy to dance to and there are several ballads on the cd so there should be something for everyone x previous image next image   by teddybare nov   a different side of linda eder although i love lindas work and have all of her previous cds i have to admit that this isnt my favorite however even this cd is far superior to many other cds that i have purchased by other artists i would listen to her sing the phone book x previous image next image   by william dec   the other side of me by linda eder love linda eder while the songs are not well known the interpetations are very good as one expects from this artist x previous image next image   by adamsauntilam sep   the other side of me good all around great linda eder music x previous image next image   why is this review inappropriate it’s spam or

information dreamland recording west hurley ny house of blues nashville tn strange cranium studiosphotographer caroline knopfon the other side of me her first album for verve linda eder branched out from her show music environment to dabble in country soundtrack her second verve release consists of movie songs which might suggest she is returning to her familiar style but the collection of  tracks is sufficiently unusual in terms of selection and musical arrangements to mark another step into unknown territory for the singer she and producer peter collins appear to have decided to limit their choices to movies released during eders lifetime which means that the yearold looks back as far as the elvis presley standard cant help falling in love from s blue hawaii and as near as the oscarwinning falling slowly from s once and eder has not returned to stringfilled traditional pop arrangements preferring small band jazz and folkpop treatments so for example the leadoff song i will wait for you is given a lowkey jazzy accompaniment and charade is treated as if it were being played by django reinhardt  the hot club of france while everybodys talking is rendered as a samba many of the performances have a downcast or even mournful tone as eder sings plaintively often either with her own overdubbed harmony voice or a background singer joining her on individual lines when love is the subject it is a little desperate against all odds if i cant have you and sometimes the subject is the singers own psychological distress help valley of the dolls maybe thats reflective of where the movies have been at during her life or maybe shes drawing a pessimistic tone out of her choices either way soundtrack is an album of moody music from the movies  william ruhlmann linda eder
