share this page continue reading the main story its a cold rainy day in june at the huntsville golf club in the countryside outside this small pennsylvania city and robert j ostrowski is trying to explain why he is suing his former employer prudential securities for  millioni want my reputation back and i want an apology from prudential mr ostrowski said as he fingered a gold ring that prudential gave him  years ago when he joined its exclusive club for top stockbrokers i walk around proud in this town because ive done nothing wrong and i carry my head highmr ostrowski  a broker for  years at the prudential office here contends that the company is trying to make him a fall guy for its regulatory problems over the marketing of mutual funds prudential said he was fired for what it contends was an unauthorized trade in the summer of mr ostrowski is not going without a fighta gaunt man whose suit hangs loosely on him he is prone to excitable rants and accusations words stream from him in the relentless desperate patter of the born salesman like a dressedup version of jack lemmon in the movie glengarry glen ross advertisement continue reading the main story the dining room at the golf club is usually a hub for the business elite but on this day it is empty and that makes mr ostrowski jumpy like many smalltown brokers he feeds off people and today there is no lunch party to barge in on or packed bar to belly up to he barely touches his food continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story lets go to the locker room he says leaping up from his seat the locker room is also empty save for a table of men drinking beer smoking cigars and playing pokerhi fellas im bob ostrowski he says buoyantly thrusting his hand into the middle of their game the beefy young men seem bemused by the intrusion and mr ostrowski doesnt linger he rushes back to his tablei was special he said i brought in  million in assets all by myself then some young punk comes in and knocks me off all of a sudden im firedits a terrible time to be a retail broker in smalltown americafor years now brokerage houses like merrill lynch and prudential have been shutting down their offices in small cities and towns but the practice has become even more common since the collapse of the stock market prudential for example has cut its number of brokers to  this quarter from  in the first quarter of from the other side they feel attacked by clients who are bitter over stock losses arbitration suits filed by investors against brokers were up  percent in the first four months of this year versus the same period last year in  some  suits were filed up  percent from  securities regulators are also investigating the mutual fund marketing practices of brokers and their firmsmany brokers are using the current climate as an excuse to retire but some are fighting back against their former firms and brokers arent alone unjusttermination suits filed by investment bank employees jumped to  last year from  in many people within the brokerage industry say the suits are frivolous desperate attempts by brokers and bankers to settle personal scores and to land one final payday there is growing evidence that many brokers did play fast and loose with their customers during the stock market boom with that boom now a hazy memory brokerage firms are cracking down on infractions that they may well have let slide during a more prosperous time advertisement continue reading the main story merrill lynch for example is adopting a sophisticated new technology system that will allow supervisors to better oversee transactions between brokers and their clients people close to the compliance process at merrill saidthe reason why we see all this finger pointing is because there is now money at stake for the brokerage firms and reputations at stake for the brokers who have been dismissed said samuel l hayes iii an emeritus professor of investment banking at harvard it has always been clear that a number of practices by brokers at brokerage firms were likely to be disadvantageous for the customerwhen the bubble burst he added thats when the suits beganin the case of robert ostrowski the facts  as they always are in suits contending unjust termination  are in dispute mr ostrowski says prudential which like other wall street firms has been under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for how it markets mutual funds is trying to blame him for its regulatory problems he also contends that he was fired because his branch manager wanted to steal his clients and and get more business out of thema spokesman for prudential securities said mr ostrowski had been terminated for conducting an unauthorized trade the spokesman declined further commentmr ostrowski like the case itself brims with ambiguities a millionaire several times over who owns two topoftheline mercedesbenzes  one for him and one for his wife  he says he is not suing prudential for the money yet he is seeking damages of more than  million and has hired a highpowered new york law firm liddle  robinson to advance his casehe says he has never taken advantage of his clients yet an arbitration case filed against him depicts him as promoting crashandburn biotechnology stocks to clients and he has been subpoenaed by the sec about the suitability of mutual funds that he and prudential sold to customersdespite his inflamed passions against his firm he remains a prudential man to the bone a daughter still works at the firm and he maintains a brokerage account there besides the ring he proudly wears an karat gold watch with an inscription on the back commending him for his  years on the chairmans council a select group of the

we are terminating you we have collected a folder of  complaints against you over the years this goes as high as mike rice the president of prudentials private client group advertisement continue reading the main story the termination was irreversible he was told and was a result of the customer complaints most specifically an incident in june in which mr ostrowski executed an unauthorized trade for one of his clients mr ostrowski denied that he made such a trade security officers were called in according to brokers who worked at the wilkesbarre office and mr ostrowski was asked to leavebefore he was fired mr ostrowski said he had heard that prudential would be shutting down the wilkesbarre office and moving it to nearby scrantonafter the shock wore off he decided to use the

prudential submitted a response hearings are to begin next januaryin november  he received a subpoena from the sec and later submitted testimony on how he marketed class a and b mutual fund shares regulators have long been concerned that brokers have been recommending class b shares to customers when class a shares which carry a discount when bought in large volumes are in some cases more appropriate and less costly like many brokers at prudential mr ostrowski was a persistent marketer of class b shareshis customers liked them because they had no upfront fee he said and for mr ostrowski the funds could bring in higher commissions bob was the most aggressive marketer of b share funds that i have ever worked with said a prudential broker who has worked with mr ostrowski and insisted on anonymity because of pending litigation he knew what the rules were and challenged them consistently advertisement continue reading the main story mr ostrowski denies ever having broken any rules selling fund sharesaccording to mr ostrowski prudential never made the guidelines clear so he stuck to the class b funds in late june  just weeks before mr ostrowski was fired prudential did circulate a directive to its branch offices laying out in detail the firms policy on the marketing of class a and b sharesi could have talked to my clients more about a shares mr ostrowski said but believe me selling mutual funds is not an easy job jeez when you hear the sec you think this guy must have been stealing from little old ladies i mean its just a and b shares after allprudential officials have never said publicly that mr ostrowskis encounter with the sec was the main reason for his dismissal but in its written response to mr ostrowskis accusations the company said that in early  during an sec audit questions were raised about the use of margin and high yield b shares in accounts of ostrowskis customersthe secs investigation into prudentials fund marketing practices is continuing and though there are a number of possible outcomes legal experts say that one possibility is for prudential to be fined for failing to supervise mr ostrowskis activitieslife in wilkesbarre
