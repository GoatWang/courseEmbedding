goldmans dominant presence in the nyses weekly program trading reports by zero hedge back in early  was one of the key drivers that set in motion the backlash against algorithmic trading and hft which back in  was the pinnacle of fringe topics and has since become a daily talking point and market scapegoat du jour on days when stocks are down but never up it also drew attention to goldmans prop trading division which zero hedge was the first and only vocal opponent of and has since been demolished courtesy of the volcker rule an event which both moodys and alliance bernstein now say could cost the bank dearly in top and bottom line yet which goldman told us on the record represents approximately  of this year’s reported net revenue guess it was more huh yet the same nyse weekly program trading update indicates that goldman up until now a monolith in nyse program trading has just lost its crown in that field as well the new king a firm called latour trading which in the last week traded  million shares in principal strategies which begs the question just who is this latour trading which dares to upstage the firm that does gods work on earth alas their website has been less

interest in the kind of financial porn that zh puts out so some fellow zhers will have to help me with a few things when you go to each of these guys pages towards the bottom it gives two dates along with principal pending and principal approved from what i can gather this signals when they begin their affiliation with the firm but again i need some help navigating this financial speak but oddly enough all of these guys got on board i think with tower recently all within weeks of one another  chuang  pending       approved   faucon  pending        approved   martello  pending        approved   niquet  pending      approved   wichs  approved   wichs with tower research capital europe  pending   approved   curiously enough gorton himself does not have a  more interest in tower in fact chuagn faucon martello and niquet all have a  or more interest but have all been there the shortest amount of time who i wonder had such high stakes before these stooges came along ive also managed to dig up latours address and phone number their address is th floor  broadway new york ny  the phone number is    surprisingly enough tower research lists themselves at the same address except on the th floor and the phone number you guessed it     so the two are literally on top of each other and it also seems at least to me that whoever is pulling the strings at tower is doing the same at latour the plot
