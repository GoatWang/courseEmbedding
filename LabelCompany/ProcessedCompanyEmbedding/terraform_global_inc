battle of two yieldcos theres only one clear winner right now travis hoium tmfflushdraw feb   at pm point energy partners lp nasdaqcafd and terraform global inc nasdaqglbl were supposed to be two of the renewable energy industrys leading yieldcos point energy partners was supposed to be a way for first solar and sunpower to fund solar projects in the us and terraform global was central to sunedisons growth plans abroad but since their launch both yieldcos have been a disappointment for investors point energy parters has plunged from a launch price of  per share to  as im writing and terraform global has genuine concerns it will end up in bankruptcy given the current state of these companies heres a look at which stock investors should throw out and which one they should take another look at image source getty images whats the point of a yieldco the point of a yieldco is to own renewable energy projects that spit off cash and pay that cash to investors in the form of a dividend they intend to use their stock as a source of funding along with debt to buy projects and add to their dividends in the future this structure requires a relatively low dividend yield so that projects can be acquired accretively if projects are bought with a rate of return of  and the company has a dividend yield of  the shares issued to fund acquisitions wouldnt be additive to future dividends they would be harmful so yieldcos with dividend yields over  have typically not been able to grow because they cant acquire products accretively this is the predicament point energy partners and terraform global find themselves in points dividend yield is a lofty  and management recently said it would only grow its dividend  in  below the  growth the dividend has had since the yieldco launched and terraform global is in so much flux its dividend is suspended altogether so both companies have to be valued based on what they are today with little growth built in the worst case scenario for these yieldcos if growth isnt likely then we should look at the downside risk for both stocks point energy partners currently has a dividend yield of  and  years of weighted average life retaining on asset contracts with offtakers the worst that can happen outside of the stock falling is investors taking their dividend over the next two decades and getting no growth in the payout terraform global is in much worse shape its still possible the company could be dragged into bankruptcy by sunedison although the likelihood of that now is small instead a buyout is being discussed with brookfield asset management which could take the entire company private but the highest offer thats been put on the table is  per share below where shares are trading now if terraform globals range of possibilities are  to less than where shares trade now with no dividend on the horizon what is there to like about the stock the better yieldco today given the sheer upheaval at terraform global point energy partners is definitely the better stock it has a solid dividend and long contracts that will keep cash flowing in and if the stock recovers and the dividend yield falls it could eventually be a growth stock which would be good for the yieldcos future  travis hoium owns shares of point energy partners first solar and sunpower the motley fool has no position in any of the
