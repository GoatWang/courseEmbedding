newsletters black market share what is the black market economic activity that takes place outside governmentsanctioned channels black market transactions usually occur “under the table” to let participants avoid government price controls or taxes the black market is also the venue where highly controlled substances or products such as drugs and firearms are illegally traded black markets can take a toll on an economy since they are shadow markets where economic activity is not recorded and taxes are not paid in the financial context the biggest black market exists for currencies in nations with strict currency controls while most consumers may shun the black market because they consider it sleazy there may be rare occasions when they have no choice but to turn to this necessary evil breaking down black market the black markets many drawbacks include the risk of fraud the possibility of violence being saddled with counterfeit goods or adulterated products which is especially dangerous in the case of medications and the fact that the buyer has no recourse as for currency black markets they exist primarily in nations that – apart from currency controls – have weak economic fundamentals such as a high inflation rate and low currency reserves and a fixed exchange rate where the domestic currency is pegged at an unrealistically high level to the us dollar or other currency as a result the currency black market is flourishing in nations like argentina iran and venezuela participating in the black market is not always a black and white matter suppose you are on vacation with your family in an exotic location and run out of formula for your baby if there is nothing available in local stores and the only way to acquire baby formula is through a black market transaction few people would hesitate to make the purchase what about paying three times the face value of a ticket to a scalper to see your favorite band or football team this is also a black market transaction that most people may find justifiable further in a number of developing nations lifesaving medicines are in short supply and often the only alternative is to procure them through the black market while critics may carp that this only serves to perpetuate the illegal and unethical practice of profiteering from someone else’s misfortune participating in the black market is a relatively easy decision to make when someone’s life is at stake trading center black black friday black money black economy black thursday black box model black box accounting black monday black swan next up

archaeology environment ergonomics maritime by mike moffatt updated june    of  what happens when a product is made illegal when a product is made illegal by the government often times a black market will emerge for said product but how does supply and demand change when goods shift from a legal to a black market a simple supply and demand graph can prove helpful in visualizing this scenario lets see how the black market affects a typical supply and demand graph and what that means for consumers   of  typical supply and demand graph black market supply and demand illustration   to understand what changes happen when a good is made illegal it is important to first illustrate what the supply and demand for the good looked like in the preblack market days to do so arbitrarily draw a downward sloping demand curve shown in blue and an upward sloping supply curve shown in red as illustrated in this graph note that price is on the xaxis and quantity is on the yaxis the point of intersection between the  curves is the natural market price when a good is legal  of  the effects of a black market when the government makes the product illegal a black market is subsequently created when a government makes a product illegal such as marijuana  things tend to happen first there is a sharp drop in supply as the penalties for selling the good cause people to shift into other industries second a drop in demand is observed as a prohibition of possessing the good deters some consumers from wanting to buy it  of  black market supply and demand graph black market supply and demand illustration   a drop in supply means the upward sloping supply curve will shift to the left similarly a drop in demand means the downward sloping demand curve will shift to the left typically the supply side effects dominate the demand side ones when the government creates a black market meaning the shift in the supply curve is larger than the shift in the demand curve this is shown with the new dark blue demand curve and the new dark red supply curve in this graph now look at the new point at which the new supply and demand curves intersect the shift in supply and demand causes the quantity consumed of the black market good to decrease while the price rises if the demand side effects dominate there will be a drop in quantity consumed but there will also see a corresponding drop in price however this does not typically happen in a black market instead there is normally a rise in price the amount of the price change and the change in quantity consumed will depend on the magnitude of the shifts of the curve as well as the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of supply show full article article how to understand spatial interaction in supply and demand
