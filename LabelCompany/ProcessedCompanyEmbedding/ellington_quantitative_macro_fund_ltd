strategies  ellington management ellington investments toggle navigation investment strategieswe manage funds and accounts in four broad strategic areas diversified credit strategies ellington’s diversified credit strategies seek to generate attractive returns through disciplined asset selection and hedging in a broad range of sectors comprising residential mortgages commercial mortgages consumer debt and corporate debt  leveraged loans our investments include securitized products unsecuritized loans and synthetic credit positions deployed in both us and european markets we rely on our deep expertise our proprietary models and research and our extensive trading relationships to implement relative value investment strategies our objective is to capture a stable income stream while mitigating return volatility over time with our core positions outperforming their associated hedges through excess cash flow andor superior price performance we seek to generate additional alpha by providing liquidity to the market and investing in sectors requiring highly specialized capabilities ellington’s approach to portfolio management emphasizes active trading within and between sectors quantitative macro strategies ellington’s quantitative macro strategy employs a multimodel approach to capture flowinduced alphas and to allocate tactically to mispriced risk premia the strategy exploits a number of alpha sources that are not captured by trend followers the strategy includes both directional and relative value models and aims to generate uncorrelated absolute returns on a diversified portfolio of futures interest rate swaps foreign exchange options and equities over the past decade ellington has made significant investment in infrastructure and technology to support an active research agenda that drives ongoing strategy innovation and evolution our multidisciplinary collaborative team includes professionals with complementary backgrounds in research development and trading we use advanced techniques from data sciences and machine learning alongside deep expertise in global markets to support our research efforts traditional mandate solutions ellington offers traditional mandate solutions including longonly lower risk and indexbased products for select institutional clients our experience navigating the rich and varied opportunity set in fixed income equities and futures allows us to add value through disciplined risk management sector selection and opportunistic trading rather than through directional macroeconomic positions in addition our proprietary portfolio management systems offer timetested support for mandatespecific investment requirements ranging from implementation of index and durationtracking strategies to compliance with legal regulatory and tax constraints such as erisa and ubti ellington’s traditional mandate solutions benefit from access to the same portfolio managers proprietary models and market insights that guide our hedge fund strategies rmbs prepayment and related relative value strategies our rmbs prepayment trading strategy has been a core strategy throughout the firm’s history the founding partners’ expertise in mortgage derivatives and agency pools dates back to the early s the strategy employs timetested agentbased analytics to select attractive agency and nonagency mortgage derivatives as well as agency pools with favorable prepayment characteristics the cmo and mbs derivatives markets were developed to disaggregate and reallocate risks inherent in mbs the dearth of traditional buyers for mbs derivatives presents a persistent structural opportunity for those who understand these risks holding periods are typically relatively long though the strategy also engages in opportunistic trading and sector rotation
