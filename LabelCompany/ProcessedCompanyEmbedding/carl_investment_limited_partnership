obscurity by david gelles december    pm december    pm photocarl icahn has taken advantage of an obscure but increasingly popular securities structure the master limited partnership and used an oil refinery business to inflate his already enormous wealthcredit heidi gutmancnbc when the billionaire carl c icahn took control of cvr energy last year critics thought the dog had finally caught the car over the years he has often threatened to buy companies but rarely followed through then in  mr icahn paid at least  billion for  percent of cvr an oil refinery business something he knew little about when he then tried to sell the company quickly and failed he appeared to be stuck with a company he did not want to own yet this year mr icahn took advantage of an obscure but increasingly popular securities structure — the master limited partnership or mlp — and used the company to inflate his already enormous wealth in january cvr under mr icahn’s direction placed its refineries into a new company cvr refining the new company is structured as an mlp a publicly traded partnership that pays no corporate tax and distributes most profit to investors thanks to those generous distributions stock market investors are valuing mlp’s at a significant premium to traditional corporations so there was a good chance cvr refining would do well as a public company “we saw the added value of creating a mlp” mr icahn said in an interview “it’s taxefficient and it passes profits through to shareholders which is great especially in a lowinterestrate environment” when cvr refining finally sold shares to the public in an initial public offering it raised  million weeks later mr icahn used that money to pay himself a huge dividend resulting in a personal gain of nearly  billion shares of both cvr energy and cvr refining meanwhile continued to trade up and pay additional distributions between the dividends and the improved market value of both companies mr icahn’s  billion investment was up more than  percent in less than a year largely because of the creation of an mlp mr icahn had made a profit of about  billion which he said was “right up there” with the best deals of his career “he’s made a lot of money” said paul sankey an analyst at deutsche bank “it’s the biggest home run of the year” mr icahn’s successful maneuvering with cvr illustrates both the enormous growth in mlp’s over the last five years and their ability to create huge personal wealth since the financial crisis the popularity of mlp’s has soared in  there were just  such companies worth a combined  billion today there are more than  and their combined value tops  billion at least  such partnerships have been created this year what’s more they are outperforming the broader stock market over the last five years the alerian index which tracks mlp performance is up  percent the standard  poor’s stock index is up  percent over the same period “this is no longer a small esoteric retail product” said jeremy michael cochief of global natural resources at barclays “it’s gotten so large that even big funds are forced to get involved“ like the real estate investment trust another increasingly popular type of taxefficient dividendpaying corporation mlp’s are booming in popularity and hotly valued as institutional investors seek yieldoriented assets yet as they become more prevalent there is heightened concern that mlp’s — which have traditionally owned stable energyrelated assets like oil and gas pipelines — are growing to encompass a more volatile range of assets including shipping companies coal producers and makers of sand for hydraulic fracturing there is even an mlp that operates cemeteries and one that operates theme parks not all have been successes “for some it works better than others” said mary lyman president of the national association of publicly traded partnerships a trade group “time will tell if it will be good for everyone who is doing it“ when the internal revenue service clarified rules about mlp’s in the mids it was responding to what it saw as abuses in the system leading up to the tax reform act of  a growing number of traditional corporations had been restructuring themselves as public partnerships as a way to avoid taxes before the crackdown even a basketball team the boston celtics was an mlp in revising the tax code the irs stripped most companies of that privilege but it identified three areas that still qualified for taxfree partnerships oil natural gas and coal companies real estate groups and financial firms that derive most of their income from dividends and capital gains today as the united states experiences a new energy boom that provision is letting new companies in lowmargin businesses — like transporting oil and gas from remote parts of the country — stay afloat passing profits on to investors if pipeline companies had to pay the full  percent corporate tax rate industry advocates say they would not survive “from a public policy perspective the taxefficient nature of mlp’s is an important component of energy independence” said peter bowden global head of midstream energy at the investment bank jefferies but the tax breaks offered to mlp’s cost the government dearly in february the joint committee on taxation which is nonpartisan significantly raised its estimate of lost tax revenue as a result of the structure saying that by  it would amount to  billion and an additional  billion a year in the future those lost billions in federal income mean publicly traded partnerships are a constant target for critics of corporate tax breaks so far the irs seems content to uphold the status quo but last year democrats proposed the end polluter welfare act which would end tax subsidies for most conventional energy companies including mlp’s the bill had few supporters in washington yet another piece of proposed legislation this one to expand the scope of mlp’s to include renewable energy companies has found advocates on both sides of the aisle given how much wealth mlp’s have created in recent years it seems more likely that they will continue their run some of the biggest fortunes in recent decades are the result of mlp’s dwarfing even mr icahn’s success at cvr richard d kinder founder of kinder morgan energy partners an early pipeline mlp is worth  billion according to forbes magazine mr kinder generated his vast wealth because of a unique clause in the structure of such partnerships when most mlp’s are set up they are actually structured as two entities — a limited partnership that sells shares to the public and a general partnership most of which is retained by the founders initially the general partnership receives just  percent of the quarterly distributions paid out by the company but if distributions increase the general partnership can receive a greater percentage of the profits the founders of two other mlp’s enterprise products and energy transfer partners also became multibillionaires because of this structure but mlp’s are not immune to the vagaries of the stock market when the partnerships cut dividends investors are apt to flee in november cvr refining cut its distribution it would pay out just  cents a share down from the previous quarter’s distribution of  shares in cvr energy and cvr refining plunged eating into mr icahn’s profits yet cvr has little cause to worry mr bowden of jefferies said that even when distributions fall mlp’s remain appealing to certain investors because of the generous tax treatment they receive from the government and the promise that they will one day pay out fortunes in dividends “these are hard vehicles to kill” he said whats next loading previous post into the bitcoin mines next post hedge fund has no plans to participate in tender offer for celesio advertisement how to partner with carl icahn call us  faqs contact reading now how to partner with carl icahn how to partner with carl icahn ian wyatt june   at  investinginvesting in stocksmlps i have an offer to make you you have a chance to partner with one of the greatest businessmen to ever live this may sound like a phony offer but it’s completely real today you have an unprecedented chance to become a “partner” with carl icahn typically investing with a legend like icahn requires a minimum hedge fund investment of  but right now you can actually invest alongside icahn in his publicly traded “partnership” – icahn enterprises nyse iep this company is technically a master limited partnership or mlp and shareholders are literally partners with icahn like many of the best investments icahn’s public persona and media reputation distract from the real investment opportunity if you ignore his public feuds with people like bill ackman and his headlineexploiting statements you’ll find that he’s actually one of the most talented investors in the world – with a unique approach icahn is the master of the leveraged buyout it’s a highwire act where an investor uses debt to buyout and overhauls a whole company getting rid of waste and streamlining productivity after returning the boughtout company to profitability the buyers scalp a healthy profit for themselves typically the debt is risk free for the investor since they can use the company’s own assets as collateral he’s developed a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider after his  takedown of troubled airline twa  as you may recall ichan became one of the most notable “leveraged buyout” kings of the era time and again he would use this type of transaction to gain control of a company using debt secured by the company’s assets  perhaps the best aspect is that icahn was able to buy out these huge companies without risking much – or in some cases – any of his own capital in the twa transaction for example he was able to personally pocket  million in just three years and since then he’s used his powerful name and worldclass connections as an activist investor in numerous companies  these include rjr nabisco texaco western union time warner and most recently herbalife but icahn’s own holding company – icahn enterprises – is itself a company that offers individuals the chance to invest alongside the leveraged buyout master through icahn enterprises investors gain direct ownership alongside icahn himself these stakes include everything from energy company cvr energy to casino operator tropicana  plus investors get exposure to his high profile activist investments in stocks like chesapeake transocean and netflix some investors try to follow in icahn’s footsteps buying his favorite stocks after his investments have been made public in sec filings but this strategy means buying several weeks or months after icahn often at premium prices they’re not getting the same deal as his partners through icahn enterprises individuals can literally invest alongside icahn when he makes his investments and you can have confidence that the company’s ceo is committed to shareholders since he personally own  of the common stock in his own company the stock has been a great performer soaring more than  over the last decade and surpassing returns of similar holding companies like berkshire hathaway nyse brkb  the stock performance alone has been enough to attract new investors recently thanks to frequent news headlines icahn enterprises is an  billion master limited partnership or mlp  like other “tax advantaged” corporations the company is required to distribute profits to investors the big and recent change at icahn enterprises is the size of that distribution  starting this year the company hiked its quarterly dividends tenfold the company is now paying a quarterly dividend of  annualized that  dividend translates into a  dividend yield if the company is able to keep the dividend at this level – or potentially raise the dividend – this stock could become an extremely lucrative income investment shares of icahn trade at  which is well below the recent high of  but the stock is up considerably from the around  where it traded from  through  the company’s latest financial report published a “net asset value” of  the value of the assets may be up in the last three months along with the stock market but until the next report in august it’ll be difficult to know the current value of the stock it’s rare to find a stock that offers outstanding capital gains and a healthy dividend yield icahn certainly has its risks including the stability of those dividend payments since the dividend is tied to investment performance it may rise and fall but the stock performance alone and opportunity to invest alongside carl icahn may be sweet enough to sway even conservative income investors to consider buying this stock i’ve personally been sitting on the sidelines and am thinking of personally buying a small stake i figured you might want to hear about this
