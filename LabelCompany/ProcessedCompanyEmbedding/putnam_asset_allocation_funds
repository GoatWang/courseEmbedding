may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations you can lose money by investing in the fund ‡ robert kea will retire from putnam effective  putnam dynamic asset allocation balanced fund pabax  putnam investments putnam

these risks before investing allocation of assets among asset classes may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations you can lose money by investing in the fund ‡ robert kea will retire from putnam

invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing allocation of assets among asset classes may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations you can lose money by investing in the fund ‡

may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to

classes may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to

may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to

these risks before investing allocation of assets among asset classes may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations you can lose money by investing in the fund ‡ robert kea will retire from putnam

decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to
