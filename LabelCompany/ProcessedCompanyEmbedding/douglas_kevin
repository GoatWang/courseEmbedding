in uncategorized sharetweetpostflip with everyone reading the fs filed last night we see the quarterly droolfest over what the super investors are doing  while it’s interesting to see what others are buying i find it most interesting to learn why it is they are doing that buying  sadly one of my favorite super investors is a man named kevin douglas and he as usual will not be filing any planned fs this quarter  who is kevin douglas  odds are you probably don’t know yet over the past decade he has built one of the most impressive investment track records  recently he has received some headlines for his thus far poor investment in american superconconductor corp but even those articles reference the fact that he is little known above any other point see the wall street journal on the topic  if you do a google search for kevin douglas it’s almost astonishing how little meaty information comes up for a guy who invests tens of millions at a time right now in the age where big brother aka the internet is always watching from what i can gather mr douglas made his initial money as the founder and chairman of douglas telecommunications a voip company  beyond that little is even know about douglas telecom as it iswas known for even the company’s website no longer exists   i found one old press release from the company that included a root directory phone number but that line now leads to a perpetual busy signal  this only adds to the mystery and intrigue swinging for the fences and connecting one may ask why i care and that’s a fair question  i first encountered mr douglas when he made a substantial investment in imax as the company seemed to be in a great deal of distress amidst the financial crisis crumbling under its debt load accrued a decade earlier during the dotcom  imax caught my eye at that time as dark knight emerged as a hit on the platform and the catalyst to look deeper was mr douglas already the majority holder ponying up for more shares in an equity raise that helped pay down a substantial chunk of the company’s debt load  following that move mr douglas owned nearly  of the company and as a result i dug further into mr douglas’ portfolio holdings and investment trackrecord to determine whether that was a good or bad thing i was pretty amazed with what i found on two fronts first he had an outstanding success rate as he made money on nearly all of his investments and second that nearly all of his successes were home runs  in baseball terms this was not your allornothing home run machine like a jim thome nor was it your dinky little singles hitter like ichiro  this was something like barry bonds in  where each at bat was either a walk a pass in investment terms or a home run greater than  cagr over a substantial stretch of time for the most part the only known investments by mr douglas are in situations where he has taken in excess of the  ownership interest reporting threshold by the sec and as such any picture is inevitably incomplete  that being said by all appearances when mr douglas invests he buys big and keeps on buying plus he operates a fairly concentrated portfolio in companies with market capitalizations under  billion  he owns enough of companies to safely say that he doesn’t trade at all around the holdings and sits tight as his money works for him  it’s this last element that is particularly impressive  he sits tight amidst volatility he sits tight holding losses and he sits tight holding massive games  patience is the man’s best friend known investment successes include hansen natural now monster beverages westport innovations jos a bank stampscom imax and silverbirch energy with one seemingly large failure in american superconductor and a remains to be seen although losing position in cree inc right now monster beverages and westport happen to be two of the market’s top performers over the last two years and they just so happen to be two of mr douglas’ most noteworthy investments  in monster beverages formerly hansen natural corporation mr douglas bought  shares at an average price of  between  and   at today’s share price of  that represents a  cagr having turned around  thousand into a sum greater than  million hat tip to stockpupfor the cost basis info with westport innovations mr douglas accumulated  of the company’s shares at prices between  and share  let’s assume an average price of roughly share which is high if anything considering he had plenty of purchases most of which happened below that price that represents a  return over the last year and a half  whereas monsterhansen generated a stellar return on a relatively small sum mr douglas put over  million to work in wprt and thus far has seen an equally lucrative outcome in terms of percent return and a far more impressive outcome in terms of gross return  don’t underestimate for a second how hard it is to double  million in contrast to any number in the thousands how does he do it considering how little is known about mr douglas it’s hard to know exactly how or what he looks for in an investment  however i have spent a decent amount of time digging into each and all of his known investments during since  and drawn several conclusions  first it’s most clear what mr douglas doesn’t look for  he doesn’t look much at all at economic forecasts or anything of that kind and further mr douglas is neither a traditional “value” nor “growth” investor  in many respects he operates far more like a venture capitalist operating in public markets than a traditional equity strategist  incidentally the only clearcut theme one can glean from his present holdings is that mr douglas has a “thing” for canada as many of his investments are companies domiciled in canada  yet that appears more of a coincidence than anything else and is most likely reflective of the fact that many american investors turn to “sexier” countries like the brics when looking abroad while ignoring our neighbor to the north my intuition after reviewing as many investments as i can is that mr douglas first assesses a company’s addressable market and then assigns probabilities based on the likelihood of the company capturing different portions of the addressable market   for example let’s say we’re talking about a company with a  billion addressable market  he would then assign probabilities for the company to capture that market opportunity  for example let’s say there is a  chance that the company captures  of the market a  chance of the company capturing  of the market and a  chance that the company captures  of the market he then calculates the weighted average of the future revenue base        billion  so long as the company is worth less than the present market capitalization grown at his
