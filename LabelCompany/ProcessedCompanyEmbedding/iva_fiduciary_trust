the discussion below supplements the information set forth in the prospectus under “investment objective and principal investment strategies” references herein to the adviser shall mean international value advisers llc   investment objectives of the funds   iva worldwide fund  the iva worldwide fund will seek longterm growth of capital by investing in a range of securities and asset classes from markets around the world including us markets no attempt is made to construct a portfolio relative to a benchmark rather the objective is to achieve a positive annual return with moderate annual downside risk   there is no assurance that the fund’s investment objective will be achieved  additionally since the fund’s investment objective has been adopted as a nonfundamental investment policy the fund’s investment objective may be changed without a vote of shareholders   iva international fund  the international fund will seek longterm growth of capital by investing in a range of securities and asset classes from markets around the world excluding us markets no attempt is made to construct a portfolio relative to a benchmark rather the objective is to achieve a positive annual return with moderate annual downside risk   there is no assurance that the fund’s investment objective will be achieved  additionally since the fund’s investment objective has been adopted as a nonfundamental investment policy the fund’s investment objective may be changed without a vote of shareholders   principal investment strategies and risks of the funds   iva worldwide fund  to achieve its objective the worldwide fund primarily seeks equity investments in companies of any capitalization that have fundamental value financial strength and stability however the fund may invest in companies with fundamental value that do not have the other characteristics  the adviser under normal market conditions intends to invest at least  but no less than  of the fund’s total assets in equity and debt securities issued by foreign companies and governments   iva international fund  to achieve its objective the international fund primarily seeks equity investments in companies of any capitalization that have fundamental value financial strength and stability however the fund may invest in companies with fundamental value that do not have the other characteristics  the adviser under normal market conditions intends to invest at least  of the fund’s total assets in equity and debt securities issued by foreign companies and governments  the fund may also invest in us government securities   principal investment strategies   as part of the principal investment strategies the funds intend to invest in both foreign and domestic fixed income securities and equities as well as precious metals   the funds may invest a maximum of  of total assets in precious metals primarily including gold bullion silver platinum and palladium     fixed income securities include bonds notes bills debentures bank debt obligations highyield debt securities commonly referred to as “junkbonds” preferred stock convertible securities loan participations and assignments rule a securities structured notes securities issued by supranational organizations and sovereign debt securities   the funds will normally invest their assets in common stocks preferred stocks convertible securities bonds debentures or other debt instruments including bank loans of in the case of the worldwide fund us and nonus companies and in the case of the international fund primarily nonus companies the funds may invest in securities of nonus issuers directly      or in the form of american depository receipts “adrs” global depository receipts “gdrs” european depository receipts “edrs” or other securities representing underlying shares of nonus issuers   when deemed appropriate by the adviser for short term investment or defensive purposes the funds may hold up to  of their assets in cash and equivalents including government obligations in the local currency of any developed country including the us commercial paper and certificates of deposit   other asset classes with different correlations to the economy or the stock market will be considered to provide further diversification and to seek downside protection in a difficult stock market these include distressed debt securities bank loans real estate interests commodities futures municipal bonds and auction market preferred securities “amps”   among the types of fixed income securities in which the funds may invest from time to time are united states government obligations  united states government obligations include treasury notes bonds and bills which are direct obligations of the united states government backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and securities issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the united states government which may be i guaranteed by the united states treasury such as the securities of the government national mortgage association or ii supported by the issuer’s right to borrow from the treasury and backed by the credit of the federal agency or instrumentality itself such as securities of the federal intermediate land banks federal land banks bank of cooperatives federal home loan banks tennessee valley authority and farmers home administration   for all securities that give rise to an obligation on the part of the funds to repay an obligation the funds will establish and maintain segregated accounts to cover such obligations as agreed upon with the counterparty   principal investment risks   foreign nonus securities investors should recognize that investing in the securities of nonus issuers generally and particularly in emerging market issuers involves special considerations which are not typically associated with investing in securities of us issuers  investments in securities of nonus issuers may involve risks arising from differences between us and nonus securities markets including less volume much greater price volatility in and relative illiquidity of nonus securities markets different trading and settlement practices and less governmental supervision and regulation from changes in currency exchange rates from high and volatile rates of inflation from economic social and political conditions and as with domestic multinational corporations from fluctuating interest rates   since most nonus securities are denominated in nonus currencies or traded primarily in securities markets in which settlements are made in nonus currencies the value of these investments and the net investment income available for distribution to shareholders of a fund may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations because a fund may purchase securities denominated in nonus currencies a change in the value of any such currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of the fund’s assets and the fund’s income available for distribution  certain of the funds’ foreign currency transactions may give rise to ordinary income or loss for federal income tax purposes to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency   in addition although a fund’s income may be received or realized in foreign currencies the fund will be required to compute and distribute its income in us dollars therefore if the value of a currency relative to the us dollar declines after a fund’s income has been earned in that currency translated into us dollars and declared as a dividend but before payment of such dividend the fund could be required to liquidate portfolio securities to pay such dividend similarly if the value of a currency relative to the us dollar declines between the time a fund incurs expenses or other obligations in us dollars in order to pay such expenses in us dollars will be greater than the equivalent amount in such currency of such expenses at the time they were incurred   certain markets are in only the earliest stages of development  there is also a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries as well as a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries  many of such markets also may be affected by developments with respect to more established markets in the region  brokers in nonus and emerging market countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the united states  these factors combined with the us regulatory requirements for openend investment companies and the restrictions on foreign investment result in potentially fewer investment opportunities for a fund and may have an adverse impact on the investment performance of a fund   there generally is less governmental supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in nonus countries than there is in the united states  for example there may be no comparable provisions under certain nonus laws to insider trading and similar investor protection securities laws that apply with respect to securities transactions consummated in the united states  further brokerage commissions and other transaction costs on nonus securities exchanges generally are higher than in the united states   with respect to investments in certain emerging market countries archaic legal systems may have an adverse impact on a fund  for example while the potential liability of a shareholder in a us corporation with      respect to acts of the corporation is generally limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain emerging market countries  similarly the rights of investors in emerging market companies may be more limited than those of shareholders of us corporations   other investment risks include the possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on certain amounts of a fund’s income which may reduce the net return on nonus investments as compared to income received from a us issuer the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign assets and the possible establishment of exchange controls expropriation confiscatory taxation other foreign governmental laws or restrictions which might affect adversely payments due on securities held by a fund the lack of extensive operating experience of eligible foreign subcustodians and legal limitations on the ability of a fund to recover assets held in custody by a foreign subcustodian in the event of the subcustodian’s bankruptcy  moreover brokerage commissions and other transactions costs on nonus securities exchanges are generally higher than in the united states   in addition there may be less publiclyavailable information about a nonus issuer than about a us issuer and nonus issuers may not be subject to the same accounting auditing and financial recordkeeping standards and requirements as us issuers  in particular the assets and profits appearing on the financial statements of an emerging market country issuer may not reflect its financial position or results of operations in the way they would be reflected had the financial statements been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  in addition for an issuer that keeps accounting records in local currency inflation accounting rules may require for both tax and accounting purposes that certain assets and liabilities be restated on the issuer’s balance sheet in order to express items in terms of currency of constant purchasing power  inflation accounting may indirectly generate losses or profits  consequently financial data may be materially affected by restatements for inflation and may not accurately reflect the real condition of those issuers and securities markets  finally in the event of a default of any such foreign obligations it may be more difficult for a fund to obtain or enforce a judgment against the issuers of such obligations  the manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain emerging market countries as well as limitations on such investments also may have an adverse impact on the operations of a fund  for example the fund may be required in certain of such countries to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares purchased reregistered in the name of the fund  reregistration may in some instances not be able to occur on a timely basis resulting in a delay during which the fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor   nonus markets have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have failed to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions  further satisfactory custodial services for investment securities may not be available in some countries having smaller emerging capital markets which may result in a fund incurring additional costs and delays in transporting and custodying such securities outside such countries delays in settlement or other problems could result in periods when assets of a fund are uninvested and no return is earned thereon  the inability of a fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems or the risk of intermediary counterparty failures could cause a fund to miss attractive investment opportunities  the inability to dispose of a portfolio security due to settlement problems could result either in losses to a fund due to subsequent declines in the value of such portfolio security or if the fund has entered into a contract to sell the security could result in possible liability to the purchaser   illiquid assets and restricted securities  each fund may hold up to  of its respective net assets in illiquid securities including certain securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale “restricted securities”  when a fund’s holdings in illiquid securities exceed  of net assets the adviser will use its best efforts to remedy the situation as promptly as practicable under the circumstances  generally restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act of  the “ act”  where registration is required a fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time the fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement  if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop a fund might obtain a less favorable price than that which prevailed when it decided to sell  restricted securities will be priced at fair value as determined in good faith by the procedures adopted approved and set forth by the board of trustees   notwithstanding the above a fund may purchase securities that have been privately placed but that are eligible for purchase and sale under rule a under the  act  that rule permits certain qualified institutional buyers such as the funds to trade in privately placed securities that have not been registered for sale under the  act  the adviser under the supervision of the board of trustees of the trust will consider whether securities purchased under rule a are illiquid and thus subject to a fund’s restriction on investing in illiquid securities  a determination as to whether a rule a security is liquid or not is a factual issue requiring an evaluation of a number of factors  in making this determination the adviser will consider the trading markets for the specific security taking into account the unregistered nature of a rule a      security  in addition the adviser could consider  the frequency of trades and quotes  the number of dealers and potential purchasers  the dealer undertakings to make a market and  the nature of the security and of market place trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer  the liquidity of rule a securities would be monitored and if as a result of changed conditions it is determined that a rule a security is no longer liquid a fund’s holdings of illiquid securities would be reviewed to determine what steps if any are required to assure that the fund does not invest more than the maximum percentage of its assets in illiquid securities   investing in rule a securities could have the effect of increasing the amount of a fund’s assets invested in illiquid securities if qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to purchase such securities  because the liquidity or illiquidity of a security depends on various factors other types of restricted securities also may be determined to be liquid under largely the same type of analysis and process as is applied in respect of rule a   liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent  liquidity risk also refers to the possibility that the fund may not be able to sell a security or close out an investment contract when it wants to   precious metals the funds may invest a maximum of  of total assets in precious metals precious metals at times have been subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredictable monetary and political policies such as currency devaluations or revaluations economic and social conditions within a country trade imbalances or trade or currency restrictions between countries the prices of precious metals however are less subject to local and companyspecific factors than securities of individual companies as a result precious metals may be more or less volatile in price than securities of companies engaged in precious metalsrelated businesses investments in precious metals can present concerns such as delivery storage and maintenance possible illiquidity and the unavailability of accurate market valuations although precious metals can be purchased in any form including bullion and coins the funds intend to purchase only those forms of precious metals that are readily marketable and that can be stored in accordance with custody regulations applicable to mutual funds a fund may incur higher custody and transaction costs for precious metals than for securities  also precious metals investments do not pay income   for a fund to qualify as a regulated investment company under current federal tax law gains from selling precious metals may not exceed  of the fund’s gross income for its taxable year  this tax requirement could cause a fund to hold or sell precious metals or securities when it would not otherwise do so   commodities and commodity contracts each fund may purchase or sell precious metals directly or may invest in precious metal commodity contracts and options on such contracts metals are considered “commodities” under the federal commodities laws  investing in precious metals in this manner carries risks as described below each fund may also invest in instruments related to precious metals including structured notes securities of precious metal finance and operating companies the fund’s exposure to the commodities markets may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities the value of commoditylinked instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates and other risks affecting a particular industry or commodity   floating rate inverse floating rate and index obligations  each fund may invest in debt securities with interest payments or maturity values that are not fixed but float in conjunction with or inversely to an underlying index or price these securities may be backed by sovereign or corporate issuers or by collateral such as mortgages the indices and prices upon which such securities can be based include interest rates currency rates and commodities prices   floating rate securities pay interest according to a coupon which is reset periodically the reset mechanism may be formula based or reflect the passing through of floating interest payments on an underlying collateral pool inverse floating rate securities are similar to floating rate securities except that their coupon payments vary inversely with an underlying index by use of a formula inverse floating rate securities tend to exhibit greater price volatility than other floating rate securities   floating rate obligations generally exhibit a low price volatility for a given stated maturity or average life because their coupons adjust with changes in interest rates interest rate risk and price volatility on inverse floating rate obligations can be high especially if leverage is used in the formula index securities pay a fixed rate of interest but have a maturity value that varies by formula so that when the obligation matures a gain or loss may be realized the risk of index obligations depends on the volatility of the underlying index the coupon payment and the maturity of the obligation   bank obligations  the funds may invest in bank obligations which may include bank certificates of deposit time deposits or bankers’ acceptances  certificates of deposit and time deposits are negotiable certificates issued against funds deposited in a commercial bank for a definite period of time and earning a specified return  bankers’ acceptances are negotiable drafts or      bills of exchange normally drawn by an importer or exporter to pay for specific merchandise which are “accepted” by a bank meaning in effect that the bank unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on maturity   lowerrated debt securities  each fund may invest in lowerrated fixedincome securities commonly known as “junk bonds”  the lower ratings reflect a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer or in general economic conditions or both or an unanticipated rise in interest rates may impair the ability of the issuer to make payments of interest and principal  the inability or perceived inability of issuers to make timely payment of interest and principal would likely make the values of securities held by the fund more volatile and could limit the fund’s ability to sell its securities at prices approximating the values the fund had placed on such securities  in the absence of a liquid trading market for securities held by it the fund at times may be unable to establish the fair value of such securities   securities ratings are based largely on the issuer’s historical financial condition and the rating agencies’ analysis at the time of rating  consequently the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer’s current financial condition which may be better or worse than the rating would indicate  in addition the rating assigned to a security by moody’s investors service inc or standard  poor’s or by any other nationally recognized securities rating agency does not reflect an assessment of the volatility of the security’s market value or the liquidity of an investment in the security   like those of other fixedincome securities the values of lowerrated securities fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates  a decrease in interest rates will generally result in an increase in the value of the fund’s fixedincome assets  conversely during periods of rising interest rates the value of the fund’s fixedincome assets will generally decline  the values of lowerrated securities may often be affected to a greater extent by changes in general economic conditions and business conditions affecting the issuers of such securities and their industries  negative publicity or investor perceptions may also adversely affect the values of lowerrated securities   changes by nationally recognized securities rating agencies in their ratings of any fixedincome security and changes in the ability of an issuer to make payments of interest and principal may also affect the value of these investments  changes in the value of portfolio securities generally will not affect income derived from these securities but will affect the fund’s net asset value  the fund will not necessarily dispose of a security when its rating is reduced below its rating at the time of purchase  however the adviser will monitor the investment to determine whether its retention will assist in meeting the fund’s investment objectives   issuers of lowerrated securities are often highly leveraged so that their ability to service their debt obligations during an economic downturn or during sustained periods of rising interest rates may be impaired  such issuers may not have more traditional methods of financing available to them and may be unable to repay outstanding obligations at maturity by refinancing  the risk of loss due to default in payment of interest or repayment of principal by such issuers is significantly greater because such securities frequently are unsecured and subordinated to the prior payment of senior indebtedness   at times a substantial portion of each fund’s assets may be invested in an issue of which the fund by itself or together with other funds and accounts managed by the adviser holds all or a major portion  although the adviser generally considers such securities to be liquid because of the availability of an institutional market for such securities it is possible that under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer the fund could find it more difficult to sell these securities when the adviser believes it advisable to do so or may be able to sell the securities only at prices lower than if they were more widely held  under these circumstances it may also be more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing the fund’s net asset value  in order to enforce its rights in the event of a default the fund may be required to participate in various legal proceedings or take possession of and manage assets securing the issuer’s obligations on such securities  this could increase the fund’s operating expenses and adversely affect the fund’s net asset value  in the case of taxexempt funds any income derived from the fund’s ownership or operation of such assets would not be taxexempt  the ability of a holder of a taxexempt security to enforce the terms of that security in a bankruptcy proceeding may be more limited than would be the case with respect to securities of private issuers  in addition the fund’s intention to qualify as a “regulated investment company” under the internal revenue code may limit the extent to which the fund may exercise its rights by taking possession of such assets   to the extent each fund invests in securities in the lower rating categories the achievement of the fund’s goals is more dependent on the adviser’s investment analysis than would be the case if the fund were investing in securities in the higher rating categories   zerocoupon and payinkind securities  the funds may invest in zero coupon and payinkind “pik” securities zero coupon securities are debt securities that pay no cash income but are sold at substantial discounts from their value at maturity pik securities pay all or a portion of their interest in the form of additional debt or equity securities because such securities do not pay current cash income the price of these securities can be volatile when interest rates fluctuate while these securities do not pay current cash income federal income tax law requires the holders of zero coupon and pik securities to      include in income each year the portion of the original issue discount or deemed discount and other noncash income on such securities accrued during that year   investment in relatively new issuers  each fund intends to invest occasionally in the common stock of selected new issuers investments in relatively new issuers ie those having continuous operating histories of less than three years may carry special risks and may be more speculative because such companies are relatively unseasoned such companies may also lack sufficient resources may be unable to generate internally the funds necessary for growth and may find external financing to be unavailable on favorable terms or even totally unavailable those companies will often be involved in the development or marketing of a new product with no established market which could lead to significant losses the securities of such issuers may have a limited trading market which may adversely affect their disposition and can result in their being priced lower than might otherwise be the case if other investors who invest in such issuers trade the same securities when a fund attempts to dispose of its holdings the fund may receive lower prices than might otherwise be the case   bank loans each fund may invest in bank loans  by purchasing a loan the fund acquires some or all of the interest of a bank or other lending institution in a loan to a particular borrower  the fund may act as part of a lending syndicate and in such cases would be purchasing a “participation” in the loan  the fund may also purchase loans by assignment from another lender  many loans are secured by the assets of the borrower and most impose restrictive covenants which must be met by the borrower  these loans are typically made by a syndicate of banks represented by an agent bank which has negotiated and structured the loan and which is responsible generally for collecting interest principal and other amounts from the borrower on its own behalf and on behalf of the other lending institutions in the syndicate and for enforcing its and their other rights against the borrower  each of the lending institutions including the agent bank lends to the borrower a portion of the total amount of the loan and retains the corresponding interest in the loan   each fund’s ability to receive payments of principal and interest and other amounts in connection with loan participations held by it will depend primarily on the financial condition of the borrower and in some cases the lending institution from which it purchases the loan  the value of collateral if any securing a loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet the borrower’s obligations or difficult to liquidate  in addition the fund’s access to collateral may be limited by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws  the failure by the fund to receive scheduled interest or principal payments on a loan would adversely affect the income of the fund and would likely reduce the value of its assets which would be reflected in a reduction in the fund’s net asset value  banks and other lending institutions generally perform a credit analysis of the borrower before originating a loan or participating in a lending syndicate  in selecting the loans in which the fund will invest however the adviser will not rely solely on that credit analysis but will perform its own investment analysis of the borrowers  the adviser’s analysis may include consideration of the borrower’s financial strength and managerial experience debt coverage additional borrowing requirements or debt maturity schedules changing financial conditions and responsiveness to changes in business conditions and interest rates  the adviser will generally not have access to nonpublic information to which other investors in syndicated loans may have access  because loans in which the fund may invest are not generally rated by independent credit rating agencies a decision by the fund to invest in a particular loan will depend almost exclusively on the adviser’s and the original lending institution’s credit analysis of the borrower  investments in loans may be of any quality including “distressed” loans and will be subject to the fund’s credit quality policy  the loans in which the fund may invest include those that pay fixed rates of interest and those that pay floating rates – ie rates that adjust periodically based on a known lending rate such as a bank’s prime rate   investing directly in loans or other direct debt instruments exposes the funds to various risks similar to those borne by a creditor  such risks include the risk of default the risk of delayed repayment and the risk of inadequate collateral  investments in loans are also less liquid than investment in publicly traded securities and carry less legal protections in the event of fraud or misrepresentation  unlike debt instruments that are securities investments in loans are not regulated by federal securities laws or the sec  in addition loan participations involve a risk of insolvency by the lending bank or other financial intermediary   arbitrage transactions to the extent that the fund invests significantly in foreign securities traded on markets that close before the fund’s valuation time it may be particularly susceptible to dilution as a result of excessive trading because events may occur after the close of foreign markets and before the fund’s valuation time that influence the value of foreign securities investors may seek to trade fund shares in an effort to benefit from their understanding of the value of foreign securities as of the fund’s valuation time this is often referred to as price arbitrage the fund has adopted procedures designed to adjust closing market prices of foreign securities under certain circumstances to reflect what the fund believes to be the fair value of those securities as of its valuation time to the extent the adjustments don’t work fully investors engaging in price arbitrage may cause dilution in the value of the fund’s shares held by other shareholders      nonprincipal investment strategies and risks of the funds   nonprincipal investment strategies   the funds may also invest their assets in trade claims municipal bonds and auction market preferred security loans of in the case of the worldwide fund us and nonus companies and in the case of the international fund primarily nonus companies   in addition the funds may invest in currencies warrants options or other similar rights in assetbacked securities collateralized debt or loan obligations or other “structured securities” in which the value is linked to the price of an underlying instrument such as a currency commodity or index or purchase or sell contracts for future delivery of commodities currencies indices or securities the funds may invest in swaps including rate caps floors and collars credit default swap contracts total return swaps and currency swaps for hedging purposes or to gain exposure to a credit which the funds may otherwise invest as well as other derivative instruments including products that have yet to be developed the funds may invest in mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities the funds may subject to a number of restrictions hold securities issued by other investment funds or trusts as well as securities issued by private investment funds   the funds may enter into repurchase agreements   nonprincipal investment risks   mortgagebacked securities each fund may invest in mortgagebacked securities and derivative mortgagebacked securities and may also invest in “principal only” and “interest only” components mortgagebacked securities are securities that directly or indirectly represent a participation in or are secured by and payable from mortgage loans on real property   as with other debt securities mortgagebacked securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk however the yield and maturity characteristics of mortgagebacked securities differ from traditional debt securities a major difference is that the principal amount of the obligations may normally be prepaid at any time because the underlying assets ie loans generally may be prepaid at any time the relationship between prepayments and interest rates may give some mortgagebacked securities less potential for growth in value than conventional fixedincome securities with comparable maturities in addition in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments tends to increase during such periods the reinvestment of prepayment proceeds by each fund will generally be at lower rates than the rates that were carried by the obligations that have been prepaid if interest rates rise borrowers may prepay mortgages more slowly than originally expected this may further reduce the market value of mortgagebacked securities and lengthen their durations because of these and other reasons a mortgagebacked security’s total return maturity and duration may be difficult to predict precisely mortgagebacked securities come in different classes that have different risks junior classes of mortgagebacked securities protect the senior class investors against losses on the underlying mortgage loans by taking the first loss if there are liquidations among the underlying loans junior classes generally receive principal and interest payments only after all required payments have been made to more senior classes if a fund invests in junior classes of mortgagerelated securities it may not be able to recover all of its investment in the securities it purchases in addition if the underlying mortgage portfolio has been overvalued or if mortgage values subsequently decline a fund may suffer significant losses   investments in mortgagebacked securities involve the risks of interruptions in the payment of interest and principal delinquency and the potential for loss of principal if the property underlying the security is sold as a result of foreclosure on the mortgage default these risks include the risks associated with direct ownership of real estate such as the effects of general and local economic conditions on real estate values the conditions of specific industry segments the ability of tenants to make lease payments and the ability of a property to attract and retain tenants which in turn may be affected by local market conditions such as oversupply of space or a reduction of available space the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance energy costs government regulations with respect to environmental zoning rent control and other matters and real estate and other taxes if the underlying borrowers cannot pay their mortgage loans they may default and the lenders may foreclose on the property finally the ability of borrowers to repay mortgage loans underlying mortgagebacked securities will typically depend upon the future availability of financing and the stability of real estate values   for mortgage loans not guaranteed by a government agency or other party the only remedy of the lender in the event of a default is to foreclose upon the property if borrowers are not able or willing to pay the principal balance on the loans there is a good chance that payments on the related mortgagerelated securities will not be made certain borrowers on underlying      mortgages may become subject to bankruptcy proceedings in which case the value of the mortgagebacked securities may decline   recent developments with subprime mortgage market  certain real estate markets have experienced declines in prices and demand most notably in the residential housing market  in addition there have been rising delinquency rates in highly leveraged loans to weaker borrowers specifically in the subprime mortgage sector that have caused rising defaults on loans  these defaults have caused unexpected losses for loan originators and certain subprime lenders  the deteriorating situation with loans and lenders has led to instability in capital markets associated with securities that are linked to the subprime mortgage market  these events may increase the risks associated with investments mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities   assetbacked securities  each fund may invest in assetbacked securities that through the use of trusts and special purpose vehicles are securitized with various types of assets such as automobile receivables credit card receivables and homeequity loans in passthrough structures similar to the mortgagerelated securities described above  in general the collateral supporting assetbacked securities is of shorter maturity than the collateral supporting mortgage loans and is less likely to experience substantial prepayments however assetbacked securities are not backed by any governmental agency   exchange traded funds “etfs” each fund may invest in etfs which are investment companies or special purpose trusts whose primary objective is to achieve the same rate of return as a particular market index while trading throughout the day on an exchange the funds will purchase and sell individual shares of etfs in the secondary market these secondary market transactions require the payment of commissions   etf shares are subject to the same risks as other investment companies as described above  certain risks of investing in an etf are similar to those of investing in an indexed mutual fund including tracking error risk the risk of errors in matching the etf’s underlying assets to the index and the risk that because an etf is not actively managed it cannot sell poorly performing stocks as long as they are represented in the index other etf risks include the risk that etfs may trade in the secondary market at a discount from their nav and the risk that the etfs may not be liquid  furthermore there may be times when the exchange halts trading in which case a fund owning etf shares would be unable to sell them until trading is resumed  in addition because etfs often invest in a portfolio of common stocks and “track” a designated index an overall decline in stocks comprising an etf’s benchmark index could have a greater impact on the etf and investors than might be the case in an investment company with a more widely diversified portfolio  losses could also occur if the etf is unable to replicate the performance of the chosen benchmark index other risks associated with etfs include the possibility that i an etf’s distributions may decline if the issuers of the etf’s portfolio securities fail to continue to pay dividends and ii under certain circumstances an etf could be terminated  should termination occur the etf could have to liquidate its portfolio when the prices for those assets are falling  in addition inadequate or irregularly provided information about an etf or its investments could expose investors in etfs to unknown risks   exchange traded notes “etns” an investment in an exchange traded note etn involves risks including possible loss of principal etns are unsecured debt securities issued by a bank that are linked to the total return of a market index risks of investing in etns also include limited portfolio diversification uncertain principal payment and illiquidity additionally the investor fee will reduce the amount of return on maturity or at redemption and as a result the investor may receive less than the principal amount a maturity or upon redemption even if the value of the relevant index has increased an investment in an etn may not be suitable for all investors   structured investments a structured investment is a security having a return tied to an underlying index or other security or asset class  structured investments generally are individually negotiated agreements and may be traded overthecounter  structured investments are organized and operated to restructure the investment characteristics of the underlying security  this restructuring involves the deposit with or purchase by an entity such as a corporation or trust on specified instruments such as commercial bank loans and the issuance by that entity or one or more classes of securities “structured securities” backed by or representing interests in the underlying instruments  the cash flow on the underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured securities to create securities with different investment characteristics such as varying maturities payment priorities and interest rate provisions and the extent of such payments made with respect to structured securities is dependent on the extent of the cash flow on the underlying instruments  because structured securities typically involve no credit enhancement their credit risk generally will be equivalent to that of the underlying instruments  investments in structured securities are generally of a class of structured securities that is either subordinated or unsubordinated to the right of payment of another class  subordinated structured securities typically have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated structured securities  structured securities are typically sold in private placement transactions and there currently is no active trading market for structured securities  investments in government and governmentrelated and restructured debt instruments are subject to special risks including the inability or unwillingness to repay principal and interest requests to reschedule or restructure outstanding debt and requests to extend additional loan amounts   certain issuers of structured investments may be deemed to be “investment companies” as defined in the  act  as a result a fund’s investment in these structured investments may be limited by the restrictions contained in the  act structured investments are typically sold in private placement transactions and there currently is no active trading market for structured investments      private investment funds each fund may invest in private investment funds “hedge funds” managed by various investment managers “managers” that use a variety of investment strategies including investment in other hedge funds by investing in hedge funds indirectly through the fund an investor indirectly bears a portion of the assetbased fees incentivebased allocations and other expenses borne by a fund as an investor in hedge funds in addition to the operating expenses of a fund the incentivebased allocations assessed by managers and borne directly by a fund may create an incentive for managers to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than those that might have been made in the absence of incentivebased allocations because the managers value the hedge funds they manage which directly affects the amount of incentivebased allocations they receive managers face a conflict of interest in performing such valuations various risks are associated with the securities and other instruments in which hedge funds may invest their investment strategies and the specialized investment techniques they may use hedge funds are not registered as investment companies under the  act therefore a fund as an investor in hedge funds will not have the benefit of the protections afforded by the  act to investors in registered investment companies such as mutual funds to the extent a fund invests in a hedge fund that allows its investors to effect withdrawals only at certain specified times a fund may not be able to withdraw its investment in such hedge fund promptly after it has made a decision to do so which may result in a loss and adversely affect a fund’s investment return to the extent a fund invests in a hedge fund that is permitted to distribute securities in kind to investors making withdrawals upon a fund’s withdrawal of all or a portion of its interest in such hedge fund a fund may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to value   investment in other investment companies  each fund may invest in unaffiliated investment funds which invest principally in securities in which that fund is authorized to invest  under the  act a fund may invest a maximum of  of its total assets in the securities of other investment companies  in addition under the  act not more than  of the fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one investment company and a fund may not purchase more than  of the outstanding voting stock of such investment company   investing in other investment companies involves substantially the same risks as investing directly in the underlying securities but may involve additional expenses at the investment company level to the extent a fund invests in other investment funds the fund’s shareholders will incur certain duplicative fees and expenses including investment advisory fees the return on such investments will be reduced by the operating expenses including investment advisory and administration fees of such investment funds and will be further reduced by fund expenses including management fees that is there will be a layering of certain fees and expenses  investments in investment companies also may involve the payment of substantial premiums above the value of such companies’ portfolio securities   despite the possibility of greater fees and expenses investment in other investment companies may be attractive for several reasons especially in connection with nonus investments because of restrictions on direct investment by us entities in certain countries investing indirectly in such countries by purchasing shares of another fund that is permitted to invest in such countries may be the most practical and efficient way for a fund to invest in such countries in other cases when a fund’s portfolio manager desires to make only a relatively small investment in a particular country investing through another fund that holds a diversified portfolio in that country may be more effective than investing directly in issuers in that country the funds do not intend to invest in such vehicles or funds unless the adviser determines that the potential benefits of such investment justify the payment of any applicable premiums   adjustable rate and auction preferred stocks typically the dividend rate on an adjustable rate preferred stock is determined prospectively each quarter by applying an adjustment formula established at the time of issuance of the stock  although adjustment formulas vary among issues they typically involve a fixed premium or discount relative to rates on specified debt securities issued by the us treasury  typically an adjustment formula will provide for a fixed premium or discount adjustment relative to the highest base yield of three specified us treasury securities the day treasury bill the year treasury note and the year treasury bond  the premium or discount adjustment to be added to or subtracted from this highest us treasury base rate yield is fixed at the time of issue and cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of the stock  the dividend rate on other preferred stocks commonly known as auction preferred stocks is adjusted at intervals that may be more frequent than quarterly such as every  days based on bids submitted by holders and prospective purchasers of such stocks and may be subject to stated maximum and minimum dividend rates  the issues of most adjustable rate and auction preferred stocks currently outstanding are perpetual but are redeemable after a specified date at the option of the issuer  certain issues supported by the credit of a highrated financial institution provide for mandatory redemption prior to expiration of the credit arrangement  no redemption can occur if full cumulative dividends are not paid  although the dividend rates on adjustable and auction preferred stocks generally are adjusted or reset frequently the market values of these preferred stocks still may fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates  market values of adjustable preferred stocks also may substantially fluctuate if interest rates increase or decrease once the maximum or minimum dividend rate for a particular stock is approached      municipal bonds municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by the states possessions or territories of the united states including the district of columbia or a political subdivision public instrumentality agency or other governmental unit of such states possessions or territories eg counties cities towns villages districts and authorities for example states possessions territories and municipalities may issue municipal bonds to raise funds for various public purposes such as airports housing hospitals mass transportation schools water and sewer works  they may also issue municipal bonds to refund outstanding obligations and to meet general operating expenses   municipal bonds may be general obligation bonds or revenue bonds  general obligation bonds are secured by the issuer’s pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest  revenue bonds are payable from revenues derived from particular facilities from the proceeds of a special excise tax or from other specific revenue sources  they are not usually payable from the general taxing power of a municipality   in addition certain types of “private activity” bonds may be issued by public authorities to obtain funding for privately operated facilities such as housing and pollution control facilities for industrial facilities and for water supply gas electricity and waste disposal facilities other types of private activity bonds are used to finance the construction repair or improvement of or to obtain equipment for privately operated industrial or commercial facilities current federal tax laws place substantial limitations on the size of certain of such issues in certain cases the interest on a private activity bond may not be exempt from federal income tax or the alternative minimum tax   futures and options on futures the funds may use interest rate foreign currency index and other futures contracts  the funds may use options on futures contracts a futures contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified quantity of the security or other financial instrument at a specified price and time  a futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract originally was written  although the value of an index might be a function of the value of certain specified securities physical delivery of these securities is not always made  a public market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes as well as financial instruments including without limitation us treasury bonds us treasury notes gnma certificates threemonth us treasury bills day commercial paper bank certificates of deposit eurodollar certificates of deposit the australian dollar the canadian dollar the british pound the japanese yen the swiss franc the mexican peso and certain multinational currencies such as the euro  it is expected that other futures contracts will be developed and traded in the future   each fund may purchase and write call and put futures options  futures options possess many of the same characteristics as options on securities and indexes discussed above  a futures option gives the holder the right in return for the premium paid to assume a long position call or short position put in a futures contract at a specified exercise price upon expiration of or at any time during the period of the option  upon exercise of a call option the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite short position  in the case of a put option the opposite is true   when a purchase or sale of a futures contract is made by a fund the fund is required to deposit with its futures commission merchant a specified amount of liquid assets “initial margin”  the margin required for a futures contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified during the term of the contract  the initial margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the futures contract that is returned to the fund upon termination of the contract assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied  each fund listed above expects to earn taxable interest income on its initial margin deposits  a futures contract held by a fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of the exchange on which it is traded  each day the fund pays or receives cash called “variation margin” equal to the daily change in value of the futures contract  this process is known as “marking to market”  variation margin does not represent a borrowing or loan by the fund but is instead a settlement between the fund and the broker of the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract expired  in computing daily net asset value each fund will mark to market its open futures positions   each fund also is required to deposit and to maintain margin with respect to put and call options on futures contracts written by it  such margin deposits will vary depending on the nature of the underlying futures contract and the related initial margin requirements the current market value of the option and other futures positions held by the fund   although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities generally these obligations are closed out prior to delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts involving the same exchange underlying security or index and delivery month  if an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price a fund realizes a capital gain or if it is more the fund realizes a capital loss  conversely if an offsetting sale price is more than the      original purchase price a fund realizes a capital gain or if it is less the fund realizes a capital loss  the transaction costs also must be included in these calculations   the funds may write covered straddles consisting of a call and a put written on the same underlying futures contract  a straddle will be covered when sufficient assets are deposited to meet the fund’s immediate obligations  each fund may use the same liquid assets to cover both the call and put options if the exercise price of the call and put are the same or if the exercise price of the call is higher than that of the put  in such cases each fund also will segregate liquid assets equivalent to the amount if any by which the put is “in the money”   limitations on use of futures and futures options  when purchasing a futures contract each fund will maintain with its futures commission merchant a margin account with a value equal to the market value of the futures contract marked to market on a daily basis  alternatively the fund may “cover” its position by purchasing a put option on the same futures contract with a strike price as high as or higher than the price of the contract held by the fund   when selling a futures contract each fund will maintain with its futures commission merchant a margin account with a value equal to the market value of the instruments underlying the contract marked to market on a daily basis  alternatively the fund may “cover” its position by owning the instruments underlying the contract or in the case of an index futures contract a portfolio with a volatility substantially similar to that of the index on which the futures contract is based or by holding a call option permitting the fund to purchase the same futures contract at a price no higher than the price of the contract written by the fund   when selling a call option on a futures contract each fund will maintain with its futures commission merchant a margin account with a value equal the total market value of the futures contract underlying the call option marked to market on a daily basis  alternatively the fund may “cover” its position by entering into a long position in the same futures contract at a price no higher than the strike price of the call option by owning the instruments underlying the futures contract or by holding a separate call option permitting the fund to purchase the same futures contract at a price not higher than the strike price of the call option sold by the fund   when selling a put option on a futures contract each fund will maintain with its futures commission merchant a margin account with a value equal the purchase price of the futures contract marked to market on a daily basis  alternatively the fund may “cover” the position either by entering into a short position in the same futures contract or by owning a separate put option permitting it to sell the same futures contract so long as the strike price of the purchased put option is the same as or higher than the strike price of the put option sold by the fund   the requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended also may limit the extent to which a fund may enter into futures futures options or forward contracts   risks associated with futures and futures options  there are several risks associated with the use of futures contracts and futures options  a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract  there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures contracts or futures options and in the securities or index positions covering them  in addition there are significant differences between the securities and indexes and futures markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between the markets  the degree of imperfection of correlation depends on circumstances such as variations in speculative market demand for futures and futures options on securities or indexes including technical influences in futures trading and futures options and differences between the financial instruments held by a fund and the instruments underlying the standard contracts available for trading in such respects as interest rate levels maturities and creditworthiness of issuers  a decision as to whether when and how to employ futures contracts and futures options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even wellconceived uses may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected interest rate trends   futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day  the daily limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price at the end of the current trading session  once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit  the daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions  for example futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses      there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a fund seeks to close out a futures contract or a futures option position and the fund would remain obligated to meet margin requirements until the position is closed  in addition many of the contracts discussed above are relatively new instruments without a significant trading history  as a result there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or continue to exist   over the counter options and futures transactions  each fund may invest in options futures swaps and related products  each fund may enter into interest rate currency and index swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars each fund may enter into these transactions to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations or to protect against any increase in the price of securities it anticipates purchasing at a later date swaps may be used in conjunction with other instruments to offset interest rate currency or other underlying risks for example interest rate swaps may be offset with “caps” “floors” or “collars”  a “cap” is essentially a call option which places a limit on the amount of floating rate interest that must be paid on a certain principal amount a “floor” is essentially a put option which places a limit on the minimum amount that would be paid on a certain principal amount a “collar” is essentially a combination of a long cap and a short floor where the limits are set at different levels   each fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis that is the two payment streams will be netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with a fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments to the extent obligations created thereby may be deemed to constitute senior securities each fund will maintain required collateral in a segregated account consisting of us government securities or cash or cash equivalents   if a fund were assigned an exercise notice on a call it has written it would be required to liquidate portfolio securities in order to satisfy the exercise unless it has other liquid assets that are sufficient to satisfy the exercise of the call when a fund has written a call there is also a risk that the market may decline between the time the fund has a call exercised against it at a price which is fixed as of the closing level of the index on the date of exercise and the time it is able to sell securities in its portfolio as with stock options a fund will not learn that an index option has been exercised until the day following the exercise date but unlike a call on stock where it would be able to deliver the underlying securities in settlement a fund may have to sell part of its securities portfolio in order to make settlement in cash and the price of such securities might decline before they can be sold for example even if an index call which a fund has written is “covered” by an index call held by the fund with the same strike price it will bear the risk that the level of the index may decline between the close of trading on the date the exercise notice is filed with the options clearing corporation and the close of trading on the date the fund exercises the call it holds or the time it sells the call which in either case would occur no earlier than the day following the day the exercise notice was filed   overthecounter “otc” transactions differ from exchangetraded transactions in several respects  otc transactions are transacted directly with dealers and not with a clearing corporation without the availability of a clearing corporation otc transaction pricing is normally done by reference to information from market makers which information is carefully monitored by the adviser and verified in appropriate cases   as otc transactions are transacted directly with dealers there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a result of the insolvency of such dealer or otherwise an otc transaction may only be terminated voluntarily by entering into a closing transaction with the dealer with whom a fund originally dealt any such cancellation may require a fund to pay a premium to that dealer in those cases in which a fund has entered into a covered transaction and cannot voluntarily terminate the transaction the fund will not be able to sell the underlying security until the transaction expires or is exercised or different cover is substituted the funds intend to enter into otc transactions only with dealers which agree to and which are expected to be capable of entering into closing transactions with the funds there is also no assurance that a fund will be able to liquidate an otc transaction at any time prior to expiration   the funds’ administrator shall be entitled to rely upon prices received from a reputable pricing service in addition and with respect to securities valued by the adviser the administrator shall be entitled to rely without inquiry upon the valuations submitted to it by the adviser and shall have no responsibility to determine the accuracy or otherwise thereof   currency exchange transactions a fund may engage in currency transactions with counterparties to hedge the value of portfolio securities denominated in particular currencies against fluctuations in relative value to gain or reduce exposure to certain currencies or to generate income or gains   currency transactions include currency forward contracts exchangelisted currency futures contracts and options thereon exchangelisted and otc options on currencies and currency swaps  a forward currency contract involves a privately negotiated obligation to purchase or sell with delivery generally required a specific currency at a future date which may be      any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract  a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows based on the notional difference among two or more currencies and operates similarly to an interest rate swap   each fund may enter into a forward contract to sell for a fixed amount of us dollars the amount of that currency approximating the value of some or all of a fund’s portfolio securities denominated in such currency for example a fund may do this if the manager believes that the currency of a particular country may decline in relation to the us dollar forward contracts may limit potential gain from a positive change in the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies transaction hedging includes entering into a currency transaction with respect to specific assets or liabilities of the fund which will generally arise in connection with the purchase or sale of portfolio securities or the receipt of income from them  position hedging is entering into a currency transaction with respect to portfolio securities positions denominated or generally quoted in that currency   each fund may crosshedge currencies by entering into transactions to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are expected to increase or decline in value relative to other currencies to which the fund has or in which the fund expects to have exposure  to reduce the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of existing or anticipated holdings of its securities a fund may also engage in proxy hedging  proxy hedging is often used when the currency to which the fund’s holdings is exposed is difficult to hedge generally or difficult to hedge against the dollar  proxy hedging entails entering into a forward contract to sell a currency the changes in the value of which are generally considered to be linked to a currency or currencies in which some or all of the fund’s securities are or are expected to be denominated and to buy dollars   currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other derivative transactions  currency transactions can result in losses to a fund if the currency being hedged fluctuates in value to a degree or in a direction that is not anticipated further the risk exists that the perceived linkage between various currencies may not be present or may not be present during the particular time that the fund is engaging in these transactions  currency transactions are also subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions  because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be adversely affected by government exchange controls limitations or restrictions on repatriation of currency and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments  these forms of governmental actions can result in losses to a fund if it is unable to deliver or receive currency or monies in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges it has entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transaction costs  buyers and sellers of currency futures contracts are subject to the same risks that apply to the use of futures contracts generally  further settlement of a currency futures contract for the purchase of most currencies must occur at a bank based in the issuing nation trading options on currency futures contracts is relatively new and the ability to establish and close out positions on these options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid market that may not always be available  currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that country’s economy   investment in blank check companies  each fund may also invest a maximum of  of total assets in equity securities of socalled “blank check” companies these are companies that raise commitments from investors that enable the company to identify and negotiate an acquisition of an operating company obtain shareholder approval of the transaction and then close on the acquisition there is a risk that the company will not be able to identify a suitable acquisition candidate or negotiate a transaction or obtain approval and close on the transaction in which case a fund may miss other investment opportunities if the company closes on an acquisition it will have similar risks to other operating companies with similar characteristics operating in a similar industry or market   trade claims  each fund may invest a maximum of  of total assets in trade claims trade claims are interests in amounts owed to suppliers of goods or services and are purchased from creditors of companies in financial difficulty and often involved in bankruptcy proceedings for purchasers such as the funds trade claims offer the potential for profits since they are often purchased at a significant discount from face value and consequently may generate capital appreciation in the event that the market value of the claim increases as the debtor’s financial position improves or the claim is paid   an investment in trade claims is very speculative and carries a high degree of risk trade claims are illiquid instruments which generally do not pay interest and there can be no guarantee that the debtor will ever be able to satisfy the obligation on the trade claim the markets in trade claims are not regulated by federal securities laws or the sec because trade claims are unsecured holders of trade claims may have a lower priority in terms of payment than certain other creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding   repurchase agreements each fund may enter into repurchase agreements  the funds may invest a maximum of  of total assets in repurchase agreements  a repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the seller of a security commits itself      at the time of sale to repurchase that security from the buyer at a mutually agreed upon time and price  the resale price is in excess of the purchase price and reflects an agreedupon market interest rate unrelated to the coupon rate on the purchased security such transactions afford a fund the opportunity to earn a return on temporarily available cash at relatively low market risk  the manager monitors the value of the securities underlying the repurchase agreement at the time the transaction is entered into and at all times during the term of the repurchase agreement to ensure that the value of the securities always equals or exceeds the repurchase price  each fund requires that additional securities be deposited if the value of the securities purchased decreases below their resale price and does not bear the risk of a decline in the value of the underlying security unless the seller defaults under the repurchase obligation   while the underlying security may be a bill certificate of indebtedness note or bond issued by an agency authority or instrumentality of the us government the obligation of the seller is not guaranteed by the us government and there is a risk that the seller may fail to repurchase the underlying security in such event a fund would attempt to exercise rights with respect to the underlying security including possible disposition in the market however a fund may be subject to various delays and risks of loss including i possible declines in the value of the underlying security during the period while the fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto ii possible reduced levels of income and lack of access to income during this period and iii inability to enforce rights and the expenses involved in the attempted enforcement   repurchase agreements with maturities of more than seven days will be treated as illiquid securities   reverse repurchase agreements the funds may enter into “reverse” repurchase agreements to avoid selling securities during unfavorable market conditions to meet redemptions  the funds may invest a maximum of  of total assets in reverse repurchase agreements  pursuant to a reverse repurchase agreement a fund will sell portfolio securities and agree to repurchase them from the buyer at a particular date and price  whenever a fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement it will establish a segregated account in which it will maintain liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the repurchase price marked to market daily including accrued interest and will subsequently monitor the account to ensure that such equivalent value is maintained  a fund pays interest on amounts obtained pursuant to reverse repurchase agreements  reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be borrowings by a fund   borrowing  borrowing creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates special risks  furthermore if a fund were to engage in borrowing an increase in interest rates could reduce the value of the fund’s shares by increasing the fund’s interest expense   subject to the limitations described under “investment limitations” below a fund may be permitted to borrow for temporary purposes andor for investment purposes such a practice will result in leveraging of a fund’s assets and may cause a fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous to do so this borrowing may be secured or unsecured provisions of the  act require a fund to maintain continuous asset coverage that is total assets including borrowings less liabilities exclusive of borrowings of  of the amount borrowed with an exception for borrowings not in excess of  of the fund’s total assets made for temporary administrative purposes any borrowings for temporary administrative purposes in excess of  of a fund’s total assets will count against this asset coverage requirement if the  asset coverage should decline as a result of market fluctuations or other reasons a fund may be required to sell some of its portfolio holdings within three days to reduce the debt and restore the  asset coverage even though it may be disadvantageous from an investment standpoint if the fund sells securities at that time  borrowing will tend to exaggerate the effect on net asset value of any increase or decrease in the market value of a fund’s portfolio money borrowed will be subject to interest costs which may or may not be recovered by appreciation of the securities purchased if any a fund also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with such borrowings or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate   from time to time the trust may enter into and make borrowings for temporary purposes related to the redemption of shares under a credit agreement with thirdparty lenders borrowings made under such a credit agreement will be allocated between the funds pursuant to guidelines approved by the board of trustees      warrants each fund may invest in warrants which are instruments that give the fund the right to purchase certain securities from an issuer at a specific price the “strike price” for a limited period of time  the strike price of warrants typically is much lower than the current market price of the underlying securities yet they are subject to similar price fluctuations  as a result warrants may be more volatile investments than the underlying securities and may offer greater potential for capital appreciation as well as capital loss  warrants do not entitle a holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying securities and do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuing company  also the value of the warrant does not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities and a warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to the expiration date  these factors can make warrants more speculative than other types of investments   in addition to warrants on securities each fund may purchase put warrants and call warrants whose values vary depending on the change in the value of one or more specified securities indices “index warrants”  index warrants are generally issued by banks or other financial institutions and give the holder the right at any time during the term of the warrant to receive upon exercise of the warrant a cash payment from the issuer based on the value of the underlying index at the time of exercise  in general if the value of the underlying index rises above the exercise price of the index warrant the holder of a call warrant will be entitled to receive a cash payment from the issuer upon exercise based on the difference between the value of the index and the exercise price of the warrant if the value of the underlying index falls the holder of a put warrant will be entitled to receive a cash payment from the issuer upon exercise based on the difference between the exercise price of the warrant and the value of the index  the holder of a warrant would not be entitled to any payments from the issuer at any time when in the case of a call warrant the exercise price is greater than the value of the underlying index or in the case of a put warrant the exercise price is less than the value of the underlying index  if a fund were not to exercise an index warrant prior to its expiration then the fund would lose the amount of the purchase price paid by it for the warrant   each fund will normally use index warrants in a manner similar to its use of options on securities indices  the risks of a fund’s use of index warrants are generally similar to those relating to its use of index options unlike most index options however index warrants are issued in limited amounts and are not obligations of a regulated clearing agency but are backed only by the credit of the bank or other institution which issues the warrant  also index warrants generally have longer terms than index options  index warrants are not likely to be as liquid as certain index options backed by a recognized clearing agency  in addition the terms of index warrants may limit the fund’s ability to exercise the warrants at such time or in such quantities as the fund would otherwise wish to do   lending of securities the funds may lend securities if such loans are secured continuously by liquid assets consisting of cash united states government securities or other appropriate securities or by a letter of credit in favor of the fund at least equal at all times to  of the market value of the securities loaned plus any accrued interest  while such securities are on loan the borrower pays the applicable fund any dividends or income received on the securities loaned and has the right to vote the securities on any matter in which the securities are entitled to be voted  loans may be terminated by the lending fund or the borrower and shall be effected according to the standard settlement time for trades in the particular loaned securities  borrowed securities must be returned to the lending fund when a loan is terminated  if a loan is collateralized by us government securities or other noncash collateral the lending fund receives a fee from the borrower  if a loan is collateralized by cash the lending fund typically invests the cash collateral for its own account in shortterm interestbearing securities and pays a fee to the borrower that normally represents a portion of the fund’s earnings on the collateral  any gain or loss in the market price of the borrowed securities that occurs during the term of the loan inures to the lending fund  the funds may incur custodial fees and other costs in connection with loans  in addition the funds’ lending agent receives a fixed fee from the funds representing a percentage of the securities loaned  the funds may in the future appoint and pay compensation to additional securities lending agents   each fund will loan no more than onethird of its total assets   in lending their portfolio securities the funds consider all facts and circumstances including the creditworthiness of the borrowing financial institution and the funds will not make any loans for terms in excess of one year  the funds will recall a loaned security in order to vote the shares on a material proxy issue  the funds will not lend their securities to any director officer employee or any other affiliated person as defined in the  act of the fund the advisor any subadvisor the administrator or the distributor unless permitted by applicable law   options transactions  the adviser believes that certain transactions in options on securities and on stock indices may be useful in limiting each fund’s investment risk and augmenting its investment return the adviser expects however the amount of each fund’s assets that will be involved in options transactions to be small relative to the fund’s assets accordingly it is expected that only a relatively small portion of each fund’s investment return will be attributable to transactions in options on securities and on stock indices each fund may invest in put and call options transactions involving options on securities and on stock indices that are traded on us and foreign exchanges or in the overthecounter markets      securities and options exchanges have established limitations on the maximum number of options that an investor or group of investors acting in concert may write  it is possible that the funds other investment vehicles advised by the adviser and other clients of the adviser may be considered such a group  position limits may restrict a fund’s ability to purchase or sell options on particular securities and on stock indices   index prices may be distorted if trading in certain stocks included in the index is interrupted  trading in the index options may also be interrupted in certain circumstances such as if trading were halted in a substantial number of stocks included in the index  if this occurred a fund would not be able to close out options which it had purchased or written and if restrictions on exercise were imposed might be unable to exercise an option it held which could result in substantial losses to a fund   covered option writing  each fund may write “covered” calls and “covered” puts on equity or debt securities and on stock indices in seeking to enhance investment return or to hedge against declines in the prices of portfolio securities or may write put options to hedge against increases in the prices of securities which it intends to purchase a call option is covered if a fund holds on a shareforshare basis either the underlying shares or a call on the same security as the call written where the exercise price of the call held is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or greater than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by a fund in cash treasury bills or other high grade shortterm obligations in a segregated account with its custodian a put option is “covered” if a fund maintains cash treasury bills or other high grade shortterm obligations with a value equal to the exercise price in a segregated account with its custodian or holds on a shareforshare basis a put on the same equity or debt security as the put written where the exercise price of the put held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put written or lower than the exercise price of the put written if the difference is maintained in a segregated account with its custodian   options on stock indices  each fund will write call options on broadly based stock market indices only if at the time of writing it holds a portfolio of stocks when a fund writes a call option on a broadly based stock market index it will segregate or put into escrow with its custodian any combination of cash cash equivalents or “qualified securities” with a market value at the time the option is written of not less than  of the current index value times the multiplier times the number of contracts a “qualified security” is an equity security which is listed on a securities exchange or on the nasdaq against which a fund has not written a call option and which has not been hedged by the sale of stock index futures   whenissued or delayeddelivery securities the funds may purchase securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis  for example delivery of and payment for these securities can take place a month or more after the date of the purchase commitment  the purchase price and the interest rate payable if any on the securities are fixed on the purchase commitment date or at the time the settlement date is fixed  the value of such securities is subject to market fluctuations and in the case of fixed income securities no interest accrues to a fund until settlement takes place  when purchasing a security on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis a fund assumes the rights and risks of ownership of the security including the risk of price and yield fluctuations accordingly at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis it will record the transaction reflect the value each day of such securities in determining its net asset value and if applicable calculate the maturity for the purposes of average maturity from that date  at the time of its acquisition a whenissued security may be valued at less than the purchase price  a fund will make commitments for such whenissued transactions only when it has the intention of actually acquiring the securities  to facilitate such acquisitions each fund will maintain with the custodian a segregated account with liquid assets consisting of cash united states government securities or other appropriate securities in an amount at least equal to such commitments  on delivery dates for such transactions each fund will meet its obligations from maturities or sales of the securities held in the segregated account andor from cash flow  if however a fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition it could as with the disposition of any other portfolio obligation incur a taxable capital gain or loss due to market fluctuation  also a fund may be disadvantaged if the other party to the transaction defaults  it is the current policy of each fund not to enter into whenissued commitments exceeding in the aggregate  of the market value of the fund’s total assets less liabilities other than the obligations created by whenissued commitments   swap agreements   total return swaps the funds may enter into total return swap contracts for investment purposes  total return swaps are contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market value of the underlying assets which may include a specified security basket of securities or security indexes during the specified period in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate of the total return from other underlying assets total return swap agreements may be used to obtain exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or market including in cases in which there may be disadvantages associated with direct ownership of a particular security in a typical total return equity swap payments made by a fund or the counterparty are based on the total      return of a particular reference asset or assets such as an equity security a combination of such securities or an index that is one party agrees to pay another party the return on a stock basket of stocks or stock index in return for a specified interest rate by entering into an equity index swap for example the index receiver can gain exposure to stocks making up the index of securities without actually purchasing those stocks total return swaps involve not only the risk associated with the investment in the underlying securities but also the risk of the counterparty not fulfilling its obligations under the agreement   credit default swaps the funds may enter into credit default swap agreements for investment purposes  a credit default swap agreement may have as reference obligations one or more securities that are not currently held by the funds the funds may be either the buyer or seller in the transaction credit default swaps may also be structured based on the debt of a basket of issuers rather than a single issuer and may be customized with respect to the default event that triggers purchase or other factors as a seller a fund generally receives an up front payment or a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the swap which typically is between six months and three years provided that there is no credit event if a credit event occurs generally the seller must pay the buyer the full face amount of deliverable obligations of the reference obligations that may have little or no value if the fund is a buyer and no credit event occurs the fund recovers nothing if the swap is held through its termination date however if a credit event occurs the buyer may elect to receive the full notional value of the swap in exchange for an equal face amount of deliverable obligations of the reference obligation that may have little or no value   the use of swap agreements by a fund entails certain risks which may be different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the securities and other investments that are the referenced asset for the swap agreement swaps are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques risk analyses and tax planning different from those associated with stocks bonds and other traditional investments the use of a swap requires an understanding not only of the referenced asset reference rate or index but also of the swap itself without the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under all the possible market conditions because some swap agreements have a leverage component adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset reference rate or index can result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the swap itself certain swaps have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of the initial investment   the largest risks associated with swaps include credit risk liquidity risk and market risk   the funds may also purchase credit default swap contracts in order to hedge against the risk of default of the debt of a particular issuer or basket of issuers in which case the funds would function as the counterparty referenced in the preceding paragraphs this would involve the risk that the investment may expire worthless and would only generate income in the event of an actual default by the issuers of the underlying obligations or as applicable a credit downgrade or other indication of financial instability it would also involve the risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment obligations to the funds in the event of a default the purchase of credit default swaps involves costs which will reduce the funds’ return   currency swaps  the funds may enter into currency swap agreements for investment purposes  currency swaps are similar to interest rate swaps except that they involve multiple currencies a fund may enter into a currency swap when it has exposure to one currency and desires exposure to a different currency typically the interest rates that determine the currency swap payments are fixed although occasionally one or both parties may pay a floating rate of interest unlike an interest rate swap however the principal amounts are exchanged at the beginning of the contract and returned at the end of the contract in addition to paying and receiving amounts at the beginning and termination of the agreements both sides will also have to pay in full periodically based upon the currency they have borrowed change in foreign exchange rates and changes in interest rates as described above may negatively affect currency swaps      investment restrictions   fundamental investment restrictions of the worldwide fund and international fund   the investment restrictions set forth below are fundamental policies of the funds and may not be changed without shareholder approval by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each fund under these restrictions each fund    may not borrow money except to the extent permitted under the  act see “borrowing” above    may not issue senior securities except as permitted borrowings or as otherwise permitted under the  act    may not underwrite securities issued by other persons except to the extent that in connection with the disposition of its portfolio investments it may be deemed to be an underwriter under federal securities laws    may not concentrate  or more of the value of its total assets in any one industry or group of industries    with respect to  of its total assets exclusive of cash cash items and government securities may not invest in securities of any issuer if immediately after such investment more than  of the total assets of the fund taken at current value would be invested in the securities of such issuer    with respect to  of its total assets may not acquire more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any issuer    may not purchase or sell real estate although it may purchase securities of issuers which deal in real estate including securities of real estate investment trusts and may purchase securities which are secured by interests in real estate    may not make loans except by purchase of debt obligations in which the fund may invest consistent with its investment policies by entering into repurchase agreements or by lending its portfolio securities a fund may loan no more than onethird of its total assets    may not purchase or sell commodities except that the fund may purchase and sell futures contracts and options may enter into foreign exchange contracts and may enter into swap agreements and other financial transactions not requiring the delivery of physical commodities notwithstanding the foregoing the fund may purchase or sell up to  in precious metals directly and purchase or sell precious metal commodity contracts or options on such contracts in compliance with applicable commodities laws   in determining whether a transaction is permitted under the  act restriction  above will be construed not to prohibit any transaction that is permitted under the  act as interpreted or modified or as otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction from time to time   in addition under normal circumstances the worldwide fund as well as the international fund each will invest in at least three foreign countries    section fof the  act generally prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing senior securities other than with respect to bank borrowings section g defines “senior security” in pertinent part as “any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness and any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends”  the funds use the term “industry” as a classification that refers to a group of companies related in terms of their primary business activities   the commodities in which the fund will invest directly have robust deep and liquid markets the funds’ investments in precious metals can be readily liquidated      notwithstanding the foregoing investment restrictions the funds may purchase securities pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights  japanese and european corporations frequently issue additional capital stock by means of subscription rights offerings to existing shareholders at a price substantially below the market price of the shares  the failure to exercise such rights would result in a fund’s interest in the issuing company being diluted  the market for such rights is not well developed in all cases and accordingly a fund may not always realize full value on the sale of rights  the exception applies in cases where the limits set forth in the investment restrictions would otherwise be exceeded by exercising rights or would have already been exceeded as a result of fluctuations in the market value of a fund’s portfolio securities with the result that a fund would be forced either to sell securities at a time when it might not otherwise have done so or to forego exercising the rights   nonfundamental investment restrictions of the worldwide fund and international fund   notwithstanding the foregoing investment restrictions as a nonfundamental restriction a fund may not purchase additional securities while it has outstanding borrowings exceeding  of its total assets   notwithstanding the foregoing investment restrictions as a nonfundamental restriction a fund may pledge mortgage hypothecate or otherwise encumber any of its assets to secure borrowings provided that such amount shall not exceed onethird of each fund’s total assets  this restriction shall not prohibit the funds from engaging in options futures and nonus currency transactions      performance   portfolio turnover  purchases and sales of portfolio securities may be made as considered advisable by the adviser in the best interests of the shareholders  each fund’s portfolio turnover rate may vary from year to year as well as within a year a fund’s distributions of any net shortterm capital gains realized from portfolio transactions are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income in addition higher portfolio turnover rates can result in corresponding increases in portfolio transaction costs for a fund see “portfolio transactions and brokerage” in this sai   for reporting purposes a fund’s portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of the value of the portfolio securities owned by the fund during the fiscal year in determining such portfolio turnover all securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year or less are excluded a  portfolio turnover rate would occur for example if all of the securities in the fund’s investment portfolio other than shortterm money market securities were replaced once during the fiscal year portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities each fund’s expected portfolio turnover rate is less than  of each fund’s total assets in the first year of operations      management of the funds   trustees and officers   the business and affairs of each fund are managed under the direction of its board of

or the “adviser” the adviser was organized as a delaware limited liability company in  its primary place of business is at  madison avenue new york new york  the adviser’s primary business is to provide a variety of investment management services to investment vehicles  the adviser is responsible for all business activities and oversight of the investment decisions made for the funds as of september   iva’s assets under management total in excess of  million   iva serves as adviser to each fund pursuant to investment advisory agreements dated as of august    the investment advisory agreement between the adviser and each respective fund provides that the adviser shall manage the operations of each fund subject to policies established by the board of trustees  pursuant to the applicable investment advisory agreement the adviser manages each fund’s investment portfolio directs purchases and sales of portfolio securities and reports thereon to a fund’s officers and trustees regularly  the adviser also provides the office space facilities equipment and personnel necessary to perform the following services for each fund sec compliance including record keeping reporting requirements and registration statements and proxies supervision of fund operations including custodian accountants and counsel and other parties performing services or operational functions for each fund certain administrative and clerical services including certain accounting services facilitation of redemption requests exchange privileges account adjustments development of new shareholder services and maintenance of certain books and records and certain services related to each fund’s shareholders including assuring that investments and redemptions are completed efficiently responding to shareholder inquiries and maintaining a flow of information to shareholders in addition the adviser pays the compensation of each fund’s officers employees and trustees affiliated with the adviser  each fund bears all other costs of its operations including the compensation of its trustees not affiliated with the adviser   as compensation for its services the worldwide fund pays the adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of  of the fund’s average daily net assets and the international fund pays the adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of  of the fund’s average daily net assets     under the terms of the investment advisory agreement between each fund and the adviser neither the adviser nor its affiliates shall be liable for losses or damages incurred by a fund unless such losses or damages are attributable to the willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence on the part of either the adviser or its affiliates or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under the management contract “disabling conduct”  in addition the funds will indemnify the adviser and its affiliates and hold each of them harmless against any losses or damages not resulting from disabling conduct   the funds the adviser and the funds’ distributor each have adopted a code of ethics under rule j of the  act these codes of ethics permit the personnel of these entities to invest in securities including securities that the funds may purchase or hold the codes of ethics are on public file with and are available from the sec   portfolio managers   the following tables set forth certain additional information with respect to the portfolio managers for each of the funds unless noted otherwise all information is provided as of september       other accounts managed by the portfolio managers   the table below identifies for each portfolio manager the number of accounts other than the funds with respect to which information is provided for which he or she has daytoday management responsibilities and the total assets in such accounts within each of the following categories registered investment companies other pooled investment vehicles and other accounts

two private funds  one of the two private funds has a feeder with assets of  million that charges a performance fee and two feeders that do not charge a performance fee with assets of  million  the other private fund with assets of  million does not charge a performance fee   portfolio manager compensation   because each portfolio manager manages other accounts including accounts that pay higher fees or accounts that pay performancebased fees potential conflicts of interest exist including potential conflicts between the investment strategy of a fund and the investment strategy of the other accounts managed by the portfolio manager and potential conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities between a fund and the other accounts   each portfolio manager is a member partner of the adviser  as of september   the compensation of each portfolio manager consisted of a partnership interest in the adviser’s profits  the compensation program does not disproportionately reward outperformance by higher feeperformance fee products  an adviser membership interest is the primary incentive for persons to maintain employment with the adviser  the adviser believes this is the best incentive to maintain stability of portfolio management personnel   potential conflicts of interest   potential conflicts of interest may arise when a fund’s portfolio manager has daytoday management responsibilities with respect to one or more other funds or other accounts as is the case for certain of the portfolio managers listed in the table above   the adviser and the funds have adopted compliance polices and procedures that are designed to avoid mitigate monitor and oversee areas that could present potential conflicts of interest  the adviser attempts to address these potential conflicts of interest through various compliance policies that are generally intended to place all accounts regardless of fee structure on the same footing for investment management purposes for example the adviser seeks to minimize the effects of competing interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by assigning portfolio managers to manage funds and accounts that share a similar investment style the adviser has also adopted trade allocation procedures that are designed to facilitate the fair allocation of limited investment opportunities among multiple funds and accounts the adviser’s trade allocation policies generally provide that each day’s transactions in securities that are purchased or sold by multiple accounts are insofar as possible averaged as to price and allocated between such accounts including the funds in a manner which in the adviser’s opinion is equitable to each account and in accordance with the amount being purchased or sold by each account certain exceptions exist for specialty regional or sector accounts trade allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis as part of the adviser’s trade oversight procedures in an attempt to ensure fairness over time across accounts and to monitor whether any account is systematically favored over time  there is no guarantee however that the policies and procedures adopted by the adviser and the funds will be able to detect andor prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may appear   these potential conflicts include   allocation of limited time and attention  a portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple funds andor accounts may devote unequal time and attention to the management of those funds andor accounts  as a result the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the case if he or she were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single fund  the effects of this potential conflict may be more pronounced where funds andor accounts overseen by a particular portfolio manager have different investment strategies   allocation of limited investment opportunities  if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple funds andor accounts the opportunity may be allocated among these several funds or accounts which may limit a fund’s ability to take full advantage of the investment opportunity      pursuit of differing strategies  at times a portfolio manager may determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the funds andor accounts for which he or she exercises investment responsibility or may decide that certain of the funds andor accounts should take differing positions with respect to a particular security  in these cases the portfolio manager may place separate transactions for one or more funds or accounts which may affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment or benefit of one or more other funds andor accounts   selection of brokersdealers  portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection of the brokers and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for the funds andor accounts that they supervise  in addition to executing trades some brokers and dealers provide portfolio managers with brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  which may result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise been available  these services may be more beneficial to certain funds or accounts than to others although the payment of brokerage commissions is subject to the requirement that the portfolio manager determine in good faith that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided to the fund a portfolio manager’s decision as to the selection of brokers and dealers could yield disproportionate costs and benefits among the funds andor accounts that he or she manages   variation in compensation  a conflict of interest may arise where the financial or other benefits available to the portfolio manager differ among the funds andor accounts that he or she manages  if the structure of the adviser’s management fee andor the portfolio manager’s compensation differs among funds andor accounts such as where certain funds or accounts pay higher management fees or performancebased management fees the portfolio manager might be motivated to help certain funds andor accounts over others  the portfolio manager might be motivated to favor funds andor accounts in which he or she has an interest or in which the adviser andor its affiliates have interests  similarly the desire to maintain or raise assets under management or to enhance the portfolio manager’s performance record or to derive other rewards financial or otherwise could influence the portfolio manager to lend preferential treatment to those funds andor accounts that could most significantly benefit the portfolio manager   related business opportunities  the adviser or its affiliates may provide more services such as distribution or recordkeeping for some types of funds or accounts than for others  in such cases a portfolio manager may benefit either directly or indirectly by devoting disproportionate attention to the management of funds andor accounts that provide greater overall returns to the adviser and its affiliates   portfolio manager securities ownership   the table below identifies ownership of fund securities by each portfolio manager   fund

charles de vaulx           proxy voting policies and procedures   although individual board members may not agree with particular policies or votes by the adviser the board has approved delegating proxy voting discretion to the adviser believing that the adviser should be responsible for voting because it is a matter relating to the investment decision making process   attached as appendix a is the summary of the guidelines and procedures that the adviser uses to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities including the procedures that the adviser uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of fund shareholders on the one hand and those of the adviser or any affiliated person of the fund or the adviser on the other  this summary of the guidelines gives a general indication as to how the adviser will vote proxies relating to portfolio securities on each issue listed  however the guidelines do not address all potential voting issues or the intricacies that may surround individual proxy votes  for that reason there may be instances in which votes may vary from the guidelines presented  notwithstanding the foregoing the adviser always endeavors to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives  when applicable information on how the fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent prior month period as of june  will be available without charge  upon request by calling   and  on the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov     securities ratings   the rating of a rating service represents the service’s opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated  however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer  consequently the funds’ investment adviser believes that the quality of debt securities in which a fund invests should be continuously reviewed  a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor  when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating should be evaluated independently  ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources which they consider reliable  ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons   the following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and standard  poor’s corporation “sp”   moody’s ratings   aaa—bonds rated aaa are judged to be the best quality  they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as “giltedge”  interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure  although the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such bonds   aa—bonds rated aa are judged to be high quality by all standards  together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds  they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risk appear somewhat larger than in aaa bonds   a—bonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations  factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future   baa—bonds rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured  interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time  such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well   ba—bonds rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured  often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future  uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class   b—bonds rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment  assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small   caa—bonds rated caa are of poor standing  such bonds may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest   ca—bonds rated ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree  such bonds are often in default or have other marked shortcomings   sp ratings   aaa—bonds rated aaa have the highest rating  capacity to pay principal and interest is extremely strong   aa—bonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay principal and interest and differ from aaa bonds only in small degree      a—bonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories   bbb—bonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay principal and interest  whereas they normally exhibit protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay principal and interest for bonds in this capacity than for bonds in higher rated categories   bb—b—ccc—cc—bonds a—arated bb b ccc and cc are regarded on balance as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation   bb indicates the lowest degree of speculation among such bonds and cc the highest degree of speculation  although such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions      distributor   shares of the funds are offered on a continuous basis through foreside distribution services lp located at  high street suite  boston ma  the “distributor” as distributor pursuant to a distribution agreement the “distribution agreement” between the distributor and the funds     rule b plans   as described in the prospectus the funds have adopted rule b plans “plans” for their class a and class c shares the plans among other things permit the class a and class c share classes to pay the distributor quarterly fees other than in exceptional cases at annual rates not exceeding  and  respectively of the assets of the class a and class c share classes as compensation for its services as principal underwriter of the shares of such classes pursuant to rule b under the  act each plan together with the distribution agreement was approved by the funds’ board of trustees including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of the funds as defined in the  act and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operations of the plan or the distribution agreement the principal types of activities for which payments under these plans may be made include payments to intermediaries for shareholder servicing for “no transaction fee” or wrap programs and for retirement plan record keeping payments under these plans also may be made for activities such as advertising printing and mailing the prospectuses to persons who are not current shareholders compensation to underwriters compensation to brokerdealers compensation to sales personnel and interest carrying or other financing charges  the trust believes that the plans may benefit the trust by increasing net sales of the funds or reducing net redemptions potentially allowing the funds to benefit from economies of scale   each plan may be terminated by vote of a majority of the independent trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the relevant class of shares of the relevant fund each plan may be amended by vote of the relevant trustees including a majority of the relevant independent trustees cast in person at a meeting called for that purpose any change in any plan that would materially increase the fees payable thereunder by the relevant class of shares of the relevant fund requires approval by a vote of the holders of a majority of such shares outstanding the funds’ trustees review quarterly a written report of such costs and the purposes for which such costs have been incurred   the plans will continue in effect for successive oneyear periods provided that each such continuance is specifically approved i by the vote of a majority of the independent trustees and ii by the vote of a majority of the entire board of trustees cast in person at a meeting called for that purpose or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding securities of the relevant class      revenue sharing   the distributor the adviser or an affiliate may from time to time out of its or their own resources make substantial cash payments—sometimes referred to as “revenue sharing” — to broker dealers or financial intermediaries for various reasons in addition to any rule b payments described elsewhere in this statement of additional information  these payments may support the delivery of services to the funds or to shareholders in the funds including without limitation transaction processing and subaccounting services the recipients of such payments may include the distributor other affiliates of the manager and brokerdealers financial institutions plan sponsors and administrators and other financial intermediaries through which investors may purchase shares of a fund in some circumstances such payments may create an incentive for an intermediary or its employees or associated persons to recommend or sell shares of a fund to you rather than shares of another mutual fund please contact your financial intermediary or plan administrator or sponsor for details about revenue sharing payments it may receive   revenue sharing payments may include any portion of subtransfer agency fees that exceed the costs of similar services provided by the funds’ transfer agent boston financial data services inc  such excess subtransfer agency payments are paid by the distributor the adviser or an affiliate out of its or their own resources  because payments will vary according to a number of factors including for example numbers of shareholder accounts serviced the firms receiving the largest such excess payments from these parties can be expected to change in order and composition from time to time        computation of net asset value   as described in the prospectus under the heading “how fund share prices are calculated” the net asset value per share “nav” of a fund’s shares of a particular class is determined by dividing the total value of a fund’s portfolio investments and other assets attributable to that class less any liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding of that class the prospectus further notes that fund shares are valued on each day that the new york stock exchange is open a “business day” and describes the time the “valuation time” as of which fund shares are valued each business day the trust expects that the holidays upon which the new york stock exchange will be closed are as follows new year’s day martin luther king jr day president’s day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day   each fund’s liabilities are allocated among its classes the total of such liabilities allocated to a class plus that class’s distribution andor servicing fees and any other expenses specially allocated to that class are then deducted from the class’s proportionate interest in the fund’s assets and the resulting amount for each class is divided by the number of shares of that class outstanding to produce the class’s nav under certain circumstances nav of classes of shares of the funds with higher service andor distribution fees may be lower than nav of the classes of shares with lower or no service andor distribution fees as a result of the relative daily expense accruals that result from paying different service andor distribution fees generally for funds that pay income dividends those dividends are expected to differ over time by approximately the amount of the expense accrual differential between a particular fund’s classes in accordance with regulations governing registered investment companies a fund’s transactions in portfolio securities and purchases and sales of fund shares which bear upon the number of fund shares outstanding are generally not reflected in nav determined for the business day on which the transactions are effected the trade date but rather on the following business day   the board of trustees of the trust has delegated primary responsibility for determining or causing to be determined the value of the funds’ portfolio securities and other assets including any fair value pricing and nav of the funds’ shares to state street bank and trust company in its capacity as administrator the “administrator” pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the board the “valuation procedures” the administrator has in turn delegated various of these responsibilities to state street bank and trust company as the funds’ custodian and other agents the trustees have established a pricing and fair valuation committee to which they have delegated responsibility to officers of the adviser for overseeing the implementation of the valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board as described in the prospectus for purposes of calculating nav the funds’ investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value the following summarizes the methods used by the funds to determine market values for the noted types of securities or instruments although other appropriate marketbased methods may be used at any time or from time to time   equity securities are generally valued at the official closing price or the last sale price on the exchange or overthecounter market that is the primary market for such securities if no sales or closing prices are reported during the day equity securities are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid and asked quotations on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily traded or using other market information obtained from a quotation reporting system established market makers or pricing services if there is only a bid or only an asked price on such date valuation will be at such bid or asked price for long or short positions respectively   precious metals are valued at the spot price at the time trading on the new york stock exchange closes normally  pm est   debt securities except for shortterm investments as described below for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean between the last bid and asked prices received from dealers in the overthecounter market in the united states or abroad except that when no asked price is available debt securities are valued at the last bid price alone  shortterm investments having a maturity of  days or less are generally valued at amortized cost   forward currency contracts are valued at the current cost of offsetting such contracts  futures contracts are generally valued at the settlement price determined by the exchange on which the instrument is primarily traded or if there were no trades that day for a particular instrument at the mean of the last available bid and asked quotations on the market in which the instrument is primarily traded   exchangetraded options are generally valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations on the exchange at closing exchange  traded options may also be valued at its nbbo national best bid and offer from participant exchanges reported by the options price reporting authority  overthecounter options not traded on an exchange are valued at the mean of the      bid and asked quotations  if there is only a bid or only an asked price on such date valuation will be at such bid or asked price for long or short options respectively   swap agreements are generally valued using a brokerdealer bid quotation or on marketbased prices provided by approved pricing sources   portfolio securities and other assets initially valued in currencies other than the us dollar are converted to us dollars using exchange rates obtained from pricing services  the value of any investment that is listed or traded on more than one exchange is based on the exchange or market determined by the adviser to be the primary trading venue for that investment  a quotation from the exchange or market deemed by the adviser to be the secondary trading venue for a particular investment may be relied upon in instances where a quotation is not available on the primary exchange or market   as described in the prospectus if market quotations are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable the funds’ investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to the valuation procedures socalled “fair value pricing” fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security or other asset and fair values used to determine a fund’s nav may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments also the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets held by a fund the prospectus provides additional information regarding the circumstances in which fair value pricing may be used and related information      disclosure of portfolio holdings   the board of trustees has adopted on behalf of the funds policies and procedures relating to disclosure of a fund’s portfolio securities these policies and procedures are designed to protect the confidentiality of each fund’s portfolio holdings information and to prevent the selective disclosure of such

portfolio holdings information is only disclosed in accordance with these policies as part of this responsibility the adviser will maintain such internal policies and procedures as it believes are reasonably necessary for preventing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential portfolio information   other registered investment companies that are advised or subadvised by the adviser may be subject to different portfolio holdings disclosure policies and neither the adviser nor the board of trustees of the trust exercises control over such policies or disclosure in addition separate account clients of the adviser have access to their portfolio holdings and are not subject to the funds’ portfolio holdings disclosure policies some of the funds that are advised or subadvised by the

traded partnerships” as defined below   b diversify its holdings so that at the end of the quarter of each fund’s taxable year i at least  of the market value of each fund’s total assets consists of cash and cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to a value not greater than  of the value of the fund’s total assets and not more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets is invested x in the securities other than those of the us government or other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or y in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined below and   c distribute with respect to each taxable year at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid—generally taxable ordinary income and the excess if any of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and net taxexempt interest income for such year   for purposes of the  gross income requirement described in a above income derived from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by the regulated investment company  however  of the net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” will be treated as qualifying income  a “qualified publicly traded partnership” is defined as a partnership i interests in which are traded on an established securities market or readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof ii that derives at least  of its income from the passive income sources defined in code section d and iii that derives less than  of its income from the qualifying income described in ai above  in addition although in general the passive loss rules of the code do not apply to regulated investment companies such rules do apply to a regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership   gains from foreign currencies including foreign currency options foreign currency swaps foreign currency futures and foreign currency forward contracts currently constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  good income test described in a above  however the treasury department has the authority to issue regulations possibly with retroactive effect excluding from the definition of “qualifying income” a fund’s foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not directly related to the fund’s principal business of investing in stock or securities   for purposes of the diversification requirements described in b above in the case of a fund’s investment in loan participations the fund shall treat both the financial intermediary and the issuer of the underlying loan as an issuer  also for purposes of b above the term “outstanding voting securities of such issuer” will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership      each fund may invest in certain assets that do not give rise to good income and do not constitute “securities” for purposes of the regulated investment company qualification tests referred to above  each fund may also invest in other assets such as various derivative and structured investment products the status of which as “securities” for the above purposes may not be fully settled   in general if a fund qualifies as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment that fund will not be subject to federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends including capital gain dividends as defined below   by contrast if a fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company in any taxable year that fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates  in addition all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income  some portions of such distributions may be eligible for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders or may be treated as qualified dividend income to individual shareholders  finally the fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a regulated investment company   each fund intends to distribute at least annually to its shareholders all or substantially all of its investment company taxable income computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and may distribute its net capital gain  investment company taxable income that is retained by the fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates  if a fund retains any net capital gain it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained  however a fund may designate the retained capital gain amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the fund on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds on a properlyfiled us tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities  for federal income tax purposes the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the fund will be increased by an amount equal under current law to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s gross income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause ii of the preceding sentence   in determining its net capital gain for capital gain dividend purposes a regulated investment company generally must treat any net capital loss or any net longterm capital loss incurred after october  as if it had been incurred in the succeeding year  treasury regulations permit a regulated investment company in determining its taxable income to elect to treat all or part of any net capital loss any net longterm capital loss or any foreign currency loss incurred after october  as if it had been incurred in the succeeding year   if a fund fails to distribute in a calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income for such year and  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending october  of such year plus any retained amount from the prior year that fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the undistributed amounts  for these purposes a fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it has been subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year ending within the calendar year a dividend paid to shareholders in january of a year generally is deemed to have been paid by a fund on december  of the preceding year if the dividend was declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in october november or december of that preceding year  each fund intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the  excise tax although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so   fund distributions   except in the case of certain shareholders eligible for preferential tax treatment eg qualified retirement or pension trusts shareholders of each fund generally will be subject to federal income tax on fund distributions  distributions are taxable whether shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares through a dividend reinvestment plan   distributions are taxable to shareholders even if they are paid from income or gains earned by a fund before a shareholder’s investment and thus were included in the price the shareholder paid for his or her shares  such distributions are likely to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when the fund’s net asset value reflects gains that are either unrealized or realized but not distributed  such realized gains may be required to be distributed even when a fund’s net asset value also reflects unrealized losses   distributions by a fund of investment income generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income  taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the fund owned the investments that generated them rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her shares  distributions of net capital gains from the sale of investments that the      fund owned for more than one year and that are properly designated by the fund as capital gain dividends “capital gain dividends” will be taxable as longterm capital gains  distributions from capital gains are generally made after applying any available capital loss carryovers  longterm capital gain rates applicable to individuals have been temporarily reduced—in general to  with lower rates applying to taxpayers in the  and  rate brackets—for taxable years beginning before january    distributions of gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income   for taxable years beginning before january   distributions of investment income designated by a fund as derived from “qualified dividend income” will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain provided that both the shareholder and the fund meet certain holding period and other requirements  specifically in order for some portion of the dividends received by a fund shareholder to be “qualified dividend income” the fund must meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividendpaying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the fund’s shares  a dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income at either the fund or shareholder level  if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for fewer than  days during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend or in the case of certain preferred stock  days during the day period beginning  days before such date  to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property  if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment income for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest or  if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is a not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation that is readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or b treated as a passive foreign investment company   in general distributions of investment income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a shareholder taxed as an individual provided the shareholder meets the holding period and other requirements described above with respect to the fund’s shares  if the aggregate qualified dividends received by the fund during any taxable year are  or more of its gross income excluding net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss then  of the fund’s dividends other than dividends properly designated as capital gain dividends will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income   dividends of net investment income received by corporate shareholders of each fund will qualify for the  dividends received deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of qualifying dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations for the taxable year  a dividend received by a fund will not be treated as a qualifying dividend  if the stock on which the dividend is paid is considered to be “debtfinanced” generally acquired with borrowed funds  if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that the fund has held for less than  days during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend less than  days during the day period beginning  days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock or  to the extent that the fund is under an obligation pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property  moreover the dividends received deduction may be disallowed or reduced  if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of the fund or  otherwise by application of the code   a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations owned by a fund may be treated as a dividend for purposes of the corporate dividends received deduction  in such cases if the issuer of the high yield discount obligations is a domestic corporation dividend payments by the fund may be eligible for the dividends received deduction to the extent of the deemed dividend portion of such accrued interest   if a fund makes a distribution to a shareholder in excess of the fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits in any taxable year the excess distribution will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in its shares and thereafter as capital gain  a return of capital is not taxable but it reduces a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares thus reducing any loss or increasing any gain on a subsequent taxable disposition by the shareholder of its shares   sales redemptions and exchanges   the sale exchange or redemption of fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss  in general any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than  months  otherwise the gain or loss on a taxable disposition of fund shares will be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss  however any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm rather      than shortterm to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed received by the shareholder with respect to the shares  all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of fund shares will be disallowed if other substantially identical shares of the fund are purchased within  days before or after the disposition  in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss   foreign taxes and investments   income received by a fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries  tax treaties between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes  if more than  of a fund’s assets at year end consist of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities that the fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the code  in such a case shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata share of such taxes  a shareholder’s ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of foreign taxes paid by a fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the code which may result in the shareholder’s not getting a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes shareholders who do not itemize on their federal income tax returns may claim a credit but not a deduction for such foreign taxes   a fund may invest in one or more “passive foreign investment companies” “pfics”  a pfic is generally any foreign corporation if for any year in the fund’s holding period i  percent or more of the income of the corporation is passive income or ii at least  percent of the assets of the corporation generally by value but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases produce or are held for the production of passive income  generally passive income for this purpose means dividends interest including income equivalent to interest royalties rents annuities the excess of gain over losses from certain property transactions and commodities transactions and foreign currency gains   investments by a fund in a pfic could potentially subject the fund to a us federal income tax including interest charges on distributions received from the pfic or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the pfic  this tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders  however a fund may make elections to avoid the imposition of such taxes  for example a fund may be able to elect to treat a pfic as a “qualified electing fund” ie make a “qef election” in which case the fund will be required to include its share of the pfic’s income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the pfic  a fund may also make an election to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in a pfic “to the market” as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in the pfic on the last day of the fund’s taxable year  such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss  the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income by the fund without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation  making either of these elections therefore may require the fund to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the fund’s total return  dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income”   finally a fund’s transactions in foreign currencies foreign currencydenominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options futures contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned   certain investments in debt obligations   if a fund purchases a debt obligation with acquisition discount or original issue discount “oid” the fund may be required to include the acquisition discount or oid in income over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time usually when the debt security matures  a fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt obligations having acquisition discount or oid which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income by the fund  the fund may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount which is greater than the total amount of cash interest the fund actually received  such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the fund or by liquidation of portfolio securities if necessary  the fund may realize gains or losses from such liquidations  in the event the fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions its shareholders may receive a larger distributions than they would in the absence of such transactions   paymentinkind securities will also give rise to income which is required to be distributed even though the fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year  in addition investments in certain etns may accrue interest which is required to be distributed to shareholders even though the fund may not receive any interest payment in cash on the security during the year      investments in debt obligations that are in the lowest rating categories or are unrated including debt obligations of issuers at risk of or in default present special tax issues for the fund  tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when the fund may cease to accrue interest oid or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and interest  these and other related issues will be addressed by each fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax   derivative transactions   if a fund engages in derivative transactions including transactions in options futures contracts forward contracts swap agreements foreign currencies and straddles other section  contracts or other similar transactions including for hedging purposes it will be subject to special tax rules including marktomarket constructive sale straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the fund’s securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains and convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses  these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders   a fund’s transactions in foreign currencydenominated debt instruments and certain of its derivative activities may produce a difference between its book income and its taxable income  if the fund’s book income exceeds its taxable income the distribution if any of such excess generally will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the fund’s remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipient’s basis in its shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset  if the fund’s book income is less than the sum of its taxable income and net taxexempt income if any the fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company and to eliminate fundlevel income tax   certain investments in real estate investment trusts   if a fund invests in equity securities of real estate investment trusts “reits” such investments may require the fund to accrue and distribute income not yet received  in order to generate sufficient cash to make the requisite distributions a fund may be required to sell securities in its portfolio including when it is not advantageous to do so that it otherwise would have continued to hold  a fund’s investment in reit equity securities may at other times result in the fund’s receipt of cash in excess of the reit’s earnings  if a fund distributes such amounts such distribution could constitute a return of capital to the fund’s shareholders for federal income tax purposes  dividends received by a fund from a reit generally will not constitute qualified dividend income   a fund may invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits “remics” or equity interests in taxable mortgage pools “tmps” or reits that invest in tmps under a notice issued by the irs and treasury regulations that have not yet been issued but may apply retroactively a portion of a fund’s income including income allocated to the fund from a reit or other passthrough entity that is attributable to a residual interest in a remic or an equity interest in a tmp referred to in the code as an “excess inclusion” will be subject to federal income tax in all events this notice also provides and the regulations are expected to provide that excess inclusion income of a regulated investment company such as the funds will be allocated to shareholders of the regulated investment company in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders with the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related interest directly  as a result a fund investing in such interests may not be a suitable investment for certain taxexempt shareholders as discussed under taxexempt shareholders below   in general excess inclusion income allocated to shareholders i cannot be offset by net operating losses subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions ii will constitute unrelated business taxable income “ubti” to entities including a qualified pension plan an individual retirement account a k plan a keogh plan or other taxexempt entity subject to tax on unrelated business income thereby potentially requiring such an entity that is allocated excess inclusion income and otherwise might not be required to file a tax return to file a tax return and pay tax on such income and iii in the case of a nonus shareholder will not qualify for any reduction in us federal withholding tax      taxexempt shareholders   under current law the funds generally serve to “block” that is prevent the attribution to shareholders of ubti from being realized by taxexempt shareholders  notwithstanding this “blocking” effect a taxexempt shareholder of a fund could realize ubti by virtue of its investment in a fund if shares in that fund constitute debtfinanced property in the hands of the taxexempt shareholder within the meaning of code section b  a taxexempt shareholder may also recognize ubti if a fund recognizes “excess inclusion income” derived from direct or indirect investments in residual interests in remics or equity interests in tmps as described above  any investment by a fund in residual interests of a collateralized mortgage obligation a “cmo” that has elected to be treated as a remic can create complex tax problems especially if the fund has state or local governments or other taxexempt organizations as shareholders   in addition special tax consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts “crts” that invest in regulated investment companies that invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in remics or equity interests in tmps under legislation enacted in december  a crt as defined in section  of the code that realizes ubti for a taxable year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such ubti under irs guidance issued in november  a crt will not recognize ubti solely as a result of investing in a fund that recognizes “excess inclusion income” which is described earlier rather as described above if at any time during any taxable year a crt or one of certain other taxexempt shareholders such as the united states a state or political subdivision or an agency or instrumentality thereof and certain energy cooperatives is a record holder of a share in a fund that recognizes “excess inclusion income” then such fund will be subject to a tax on that portion of its “excess inclusion income” for the taxable year that is allocable to such shareholders at the highest federal corporate income tax rate the extent to which the irs guidance in respect of crts remains applicable in light of the december  crt legislation is unclear to the extent permitted under the  act the funds may elect to allocate any such tax specially to the applicable crt or other shareholder and thus reduce such shareholder’s distributions for the year by the amount of the tax that relates to such shareholder’s interest in the fund crts are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences of investing in a fund   backup withholding   each fund generally is required to withhold and remit to the us treasury a percentage of the taxable distributions and redemption proceeds paid to any individual shareholder who fails to properly furnish the fund with a correct taxpayer identification number “tin” who has underreported dividend or interest income or who fails to certify to the fund that he or she is not subject to such withholding  the backup withholding tax rate is  for amounts paid through   this rate will expire and the backup withholding tax rate will be  for amounts paid after december   unless congress enacts legislation providing otherwise   nonus shareholders   in general dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by a fund to a shareholder that is not a “us person” within the meaning of the code such shareholder a “foreign person” are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  percent or lower applicable treaty rate even if they are funded by income or gains such as portfolio interest shortterm capital gains or foreignsource dividend and interest income that if paid to a foreign person directly would not be subject to withholding   previous legislation provided that in general for taxable years of a fund beginning before january   a fund was not required to withhold any amounts with respect to i distributions of net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses and ii distributions of ussource interest income that would not be subject to us federal income tax if earned directly by a foreign person in each case to the extent that the fund properly designated such distributions  under this prior legislation a fund was also allowed to opt not to designate dividends as interestrelated dividends or shortterm capital gain dividends to the full extent permitted by the code  the exemption from withholding for interest related and shortterm capital gain dividends is no longer effective  pending legislation may reinstate and extend this exemption but it is unclear at this time whether the legislation will be enacted   in order to qualify for this exemption from withholding if it is reinstated a foreign person will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its nonus status including in general furnishing an irs form wben or substitute form  in the case of shares held through an intermediary the intermediary may withhold even if the fund makes a designation with respect to a payment  foreign persons should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts   under us federal tax law a beneficial holder of shares who is a foreign person is not in general subject to us federal income tax on gains and is not allowed a deduction for losses realized on the sale of shares of a fund or on capital gain dividends unless i such gain or capital gain dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business      carried on by such holder within the united states or ii in the case of an individual holder the holder is present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating  days or more during the year of the sale or capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met  if a shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to us federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the shareholder in the united states   in order for a foreign investor to qualify for an exemption from the backup withholding the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing requirements  foreign investors in the fund should consult their tax advisers in this regard  backup withholding is not an additional tax  any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholder’s us federal income tax liability provided the appropriate information is furnished to the internal revenue service   a beneficial holder of shares who is a foreign person may be subject to state and local tax and to the us federal estate tax in addition to the federal tax on income referred to above   tax deferred plans   special tax rules apply to investments through defined contribution plans and other taxqualified plans  shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine the suitability of shares of a fund as an investment through such plans and the precise effect of such an investment on their particular tax situation   tax shelter reporting   under treasury regulations if a shareholder recognizes a loss of  million or more for an individual shareholder or  million or more for a corporate shareholder the shareholder must file with the internal revenue service a disclosure statement on form   direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted  future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all regulated investment companies  the fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper  shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances      portfolio transactions and brokerage   investment decisions and portfolio transactions   investment decisions for the funds are made with a view to achieving their respective investment objectives investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic suitability for the particular client involved including the funds some securities considered for investment by the funds may also be appropriate for other clients served by the adviser thus a particular security may be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have been bought or sold for other clients at the same time if a purchase or sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of a fund and one or more of these clients is considered at or about the same time transactions in such securities will be allocated among the fund and clients in a manner deemed fair and reasonable by the adviser particularly when investing in less liquid or illiquid securities of smaller capitalization companies such allocation may take into account the asset size of a fund in determining whether the allocation of an investment is suitable the adviser may aggregate orders for the funds with simultaneous transactions entered into on behalf of its other clients so long as price and transaction expenses are averaged either for the portfolio transaction or for that day likewise a particular security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more clients are selling the security in some instances one client may sell a particular security to another client it also sometimes happens that two or more clients simultaneously purchase or sell the same security in which event each day’s transactions in such security are insofar as possible averaged as to price and allocated between such clients in a manner which in the adviser’s opinion is equitable to each and in accordance with the amount being purchased or sold by each there may be circumstances when purchases or sales of portfolio securities for one or more clients will have an adverse effect on other clients including the funds   brokerage and research services   there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded on a principal basis in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the funds usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the funds includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer transactions on us stock exchanges and other agency transactions involve the payment by the funds of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers also a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in nonus securities generally involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions which are generally higher than those in the united states  the purchase by a fund of participations or assignments may be pursuant to privately negotiated transactions pursuant to which a fund may by required to pay fees to the seller or forego a portion of payments in respect of the participation agreement   the adviser places orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities options and futures contracts and buys and sells such securities options and futures for a fund through a substantial number of brokers and dealers in so doing the adviser uses its best efforts to obtain for the fund the most favorable price and execution available except to the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions as described below in seeking the most favorable price and execution the adviser having in mind a fund’s best interests considers all factors it deems relevant including by way of illustration price the size of the transaction the nature of the market for the security the amount of the commission the timing of the transaction taking into account market prices and trends the reputation experience and financial stability of the brokerdealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the brokerdealer in that or other transactions   the adviser places orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for a fund’s accounts with brokers or dealers selected by it in its discretion in effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities for the accounts of the funds the adviser will seek the best price and execution of the funds’ orders in doing so a fund may pay higher commission rates than the lowest available when the adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in light of the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the broker effecting the transaction as discussed below although the funds may use a brokerdealer that sells fund shares to effect transactions for the funds’ portfolios the funds will not consider the sale of fund shares as a factor when selecting brokerdealers to execute those transactions   each fund currently has no intention to use soft dollars   it has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business for advisers of investment companies and other institutional investors to receive research and brokerage products and services together “services” from brokerdealers which execute portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers consistent with this practice the adviser receives services from many brokerdealers with which the adviser places the funds’ portfolio transactions these services      which in some cases may also be purchased for cash may include among other things such items as general economic and security market reviews industry and company reviews evaluations of securities recommendations as to the purchase and sale of securities and services related to the execution of securities transactions the advisory fees paid by the funds are not reduced because the adviser receives such services even though the receipt of such services relieves the adviser from expenses they might otherwise bear research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers chosen by the adviser to place the funds’ portfolio transactions may be useful to the adviser in providing services to the adviser’s other clients although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing the funds conversely research and brokerage services provided to the adviser by brokerdealers in connection with trades executed on behalf of other clients of the adviser may be useful to the adviser in managing the funds although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing such other clients   in reliance on the “safe harbor” provided by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “ act” the adviser may cause a fund to pay a brokerdealer which provides “brokerage and research services” as defined for purposes of section e to the adviser an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for the fund in excess of the commission which another brokerdealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the adviser determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the brokerdealer viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the adviser’s overall responsibilities to the advisory accounts for which it exercises investment discretion   the adviser may place orders for the purchase and sale of exchangelisted portfolio securities with a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser where in the judgment of the adviser such firm will be able to obtain a price and execution at least as favorable as other qualified brokerdealers pursuant to rules of the sec a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser may receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for a fund on a securities exchange if the commissions paid to such an affiliated brokerdealer by a fund on exchange transactions do not exceed “usual and customary brokerage commissions” the rules define “usual and customary” commissions to include amounts which are “reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time”   because the funds have not yet commenced operations information on specific brokerage transactions or commission costs is not included in this sai      description of the trust   the trust’s declaration of trust permits the trustees to issue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of each series each share of each fund represents an equal proportionate interest in such fund with each other share of that fund and is entitled to a proportionate interest in the dividends and distributions from that fund the declaration of trust further permits the board of trustees to divide the shares of each series into any number of separate classes each having such rights and preferences relative to other classes of the same series as the board of trustees may determine when you invest in a fund you acquire freely transferable shares of beneficial interest that entitle you to receive dividends as determined by the board of trustees and to cast a vote for each share you own at shareholder meetings the shares of each fund do not have any preemptive rights upon termination of any fund whether pursuant to liquidation of the trust or otherwise shareholders of each class of that fund are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets attributable to that class of shares of that fund available for distribution to shareholders the declaration of trust also permits the board of trustees to charge shareholders directly for custodial transfer agency and servicing expenses   shares of each fund are currently divided into three classes designated class a class c and class i shares   the assets received by each class of a fund for the issue or sale of its shares and all income earnings profits losses and proceeds therefrom subject only to the rights of creditors are allocated to and constitute the underlying assets of that class of the fund the underlying assets of each class of a fund are segregated and are charged with the expenses with respect to that class of the fund and with a share of the general expenses of the relevant fund and trust any general expenses of the trust that are not readily identifiable as belonging to a particular class of a fund are allocated by or under the direction of the trustees in such manner as the trustees determine to be fair and equitable while the expenses of the trust are allocated to the separate books of account of each fund certain expenses may be legally chargeable against the assets of all of the funds in a trust   the declaration of trust also permits the board of trustees without shareholder approval to subdivide any fund or series or class of shares into various subseries or subclasses with such dividend preferences and other rights as the trustees may designate the board of trustees may also without shareholder approval establish one or more additional series or classes or merge two or more existing series or classes without shareholder approval shareholders’ investments in such an additional or merged series would be evidenced by a separate series of shares ie a new “fund”   the declaration of trust provides for the perpetual existence of the trust  the trust or any fund however may be terminated at any time by vote of at least two thirds of the outstanding shares of each fund affected similarly any class within a fund may be terminated by vote of at least two thirds of the outstanding shares of such class the declaration of trust further provides that the board of trustees may also without shareholder approval terminate the relevant trust or fund upon written notice to its shareholders   voting rights shareholders of all funds are entitled to one vote for each full share held with fractional votes for each fractional share held and may vote to the extent provided therein on the election of trustees and the termination of the trust and on other matters submitted to the vote of shareholders   all classes of shares of the funds have identical voting rights except that each class of shares has exclusive voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders that relates solely to that class and has separate voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders in which the interests of one class differ from the interests of any other class each class of shares has exclusive voting rights with respect to matters pertaining to any distribution or servicing plan or agreement applicable to that class matters submitted to shareholder vote will be approved by each series separately except i when required by the  act shares shall be voted together and ii when the matter does not affect all series then only shareholders of the series affected shall be entitled to vote on the matter consistent with the current position of the sec shareholders of all series and classes vote together irrespective of series or class on the election of trustees and the selection of the trust’s independent registered public accounting firm but shareholders of each series vote separately on most other matters requiring shareholder approval such as certain changes in investment policies of that series or the approval of the investment advisory and any subadvisory agreement relating to that series and shareholders of each class within a series vote separately as to the rule b plan if any relating to that class   there will normally be no meetings of shareholders for the purpose of electing trustees except that in accordance with the  act i a trust will hold a shareholders’ meeting for the election of trustees at such time as less than a majority of the trustees holding office have been elected by shareholders and ii if there is a vacancy on the board of trustees such vacancy may be filled only by a vote of the shareholders unless after filling such vacancy by other means at least twothirds of the trustees holding office shall have been elected by the shareholders in addition trustees may be removed from office      by a written consent signed by the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares and filed with a trust’s custodian or by a vote of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares at a meeting duly called for that purpose   except as set forth above the trustees shall continue to hold office and may appoint successor trustees shareholder voting rights are not cumulative   the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of the trust voted assuming a quorum is present in person or by proxy is required to amend the declaration of trust if such amendment  affects the power of shareholders to vote  amends the section of the relevant declaration of trust governing amendments  is one for which a vote is required by law or by the trust’s registration statement or  is submitted to the shareholders by the trustees if one or more new series of a trust is established and designated by the trustees the shareholders having beneficial interests in the funds shall not be entitled to vote on matters exclusively affecting such new series such matters including without limitation the adoption of or any change in the investment objectives policies or restrictions of the new series and the approval of the investment advisory contracts of the new series similarly the shareholders of the new series shall not be entitled to vote on any such matters as they affect the other funds   shareholder and trustee liability under massachusetts law shareholders could under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust however the declaration of trust disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of each fund’s property for all loss and expense of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund by reason of owning shares of such fund thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is considered remote since it is limited to circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and a fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations   the declaration of trust further provides that the board of trustees will not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law however nothing in the declaration of trust protects a trustee against any liability to which the trustee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office the declaration of trust of the trust provides for indemnification by the trust of trustees and officers of the trust except with respect to any matter as to which any such person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interests of the trust such persons may not be indemnified against any liability to the trust or the trust’s shareholders to whom he or she would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office      other information

that it will generally not be subject to federal income tax        appendix a     proxy voting policies and procedures     the board of trustees of the funds has delegated the authority to develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the adviser  the adviser has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and procedures the “policies” to ensure that the adviser votes proxies relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients     in voting proxies the adviser is guided by general fiduciary principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest of clients  the adviser attempts to consider all factors that could affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize shareholder values  the adviser may utilize an external service provider to provide it with information andor a recommendation with regard to proxy votes  however such recommendations do not relieve the adviser of its responsibility for the proxy vote     in the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in the policies the adviser generally votes in accordance with such stated position  in the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of factors set forth in the policies that the adviser considers in voting on such issue the adviser votes on a casebycase basis in accordance with the general principles set forth above and considering such enumerated factors  in the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated position or list of factors that the adviser considers in voting on such issue the adviser votes on a casebycase basis in accordance with the general principles set forth above  issues for which there is a stated position set forth in the policies or for which there is a list of factors set forth in the policies that the adviser considers in voting on such issues fall into a variety of categories including election of trustees ratification of auditors proxy and tender offer defenses capital structure issues executive and trustee compensation mergers and corporate restructurings and social and environmental issues  the stated position on an issue set forth in the policies can always be superseded subject to the duty to act solely in the best interest of the beneficial owners of accounts by the investment management professionals responsible for the account whose shares are being voted  issues applicable to a particular industry may cause the adviser to abandon a policy that would have otherwise applied to issuers generally  the adviser’s policy is to vote all proxies from a specific issuer in the same way for each client absent qualifying restrictions from the client     in furtherance of the adviser’s goal to vote proxies in the best interest of clients the adviser follows procedures designed to identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the adviser’s interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on behalf of such clients  to seek to identify conflicts of interest the adviser reviews its relationship with the issuer of each security to determine if the adviser or any of its employees has any financial business or personal relationship with the issuer the adviser is also sensitive to the fact that a significant publicized relationship between an issuer and a non affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner in which the adviser decides to vote a proxy with respect to such issuer     the adviser’s cco reviews and addresses conflicts of interest brought to her attention  a proxy issue that will be voted in accordance with a stated position on an issue or in accordance with the recommendation of an independent third party is not brought to the attention of the cco for a conflict of interest review because the adviser’s position is that to the extent a conflict of interest issue exists it is resolved by voting in accordance with a predetermined policy or in accordance with the recommendation of an independent third party  with respect to a conflict of interest brought to its attention the cco first determines whether such conflict of interest is material  a conflict of interest is considered material to the extent that it is determined that such conflict is likely to influence or appear to influence the adviser’s decisionmaking in voting proxies     if it is determined by the cco that a conflict of interest is not material the adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict  if it is determined by the cco that a conflict of interest is material the cco is responsible for determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted  such determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the conflict of interest  methods of resolving a material conflict of interest may include but are not limited to disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent before voting or suggesting to clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their behalf   a rdates referenced herein   and   documents incorporated by reference this ‘’ filing    date    other filingsbposnqfnt  ncsr  nsarbfiled on  effective on list all filings  ↑topfiling
