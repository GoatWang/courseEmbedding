business enterprise market hereinafter referred to as the sme market in general sme market companies range from sole proprietors  the oneperson operation with no employees to those companies that have up to  employees we target those sme companies with limited resources andor infrastructure looking to outsource all or part of their operations andor corporate level functions to get started we recommend clients start with outsourcing one or more of these areas financial and management reporting accounting tax reporting legal and compliance human resource management or sales and marketing collectively our business services we also look to help clients identify implement and maintain business software products that are currently available in the marketplace that help streamline business operations through automation our managed software services our business services and managed software services are collectively referred to as our services outsourcing has clearly becoming an integral part of a business strategy to achieve unparalleled performance packaged outsourcing takes it to the next level savvy business owners intent on guiding their companies toward optimized performance began by outsourcing a single process that is the first step bundled outsourcing also addresses the challenge of managing multiple providers and contacts it is easier to manage and measure because it creates standardized repeatable processes under one integrated governance structure that ensures maximum performance at lower sustained costs our opportunity sme company owners and managers often are tasked with functioning in a number of capacities in order to grow their business however at some point in time in the growth curve a business owner or manager is faced with the decision of continuing to function in a number of capacities or to seek outside assistance to help with this decision we bring outsourced people business processes and software tools to businesses to reduce costs and to run more efficiently and effectively we believe that if a small business doesnt embrace and leverage the power of outsourcing and automation it significantly limits the companys ability to keep pace with business growth goals and objectives as such we believe that our services met a large unmet need for sme companies the sme market is particularly attractive because  it is large continues to grow and remains underserved by professional services companies and  it typically has fewer inhouse resources than larger businesses and as a result is generally more dependent on external resources our strategy our strategy for growing our operations includes  rolling out various outbound sales and marketing campaigns to grow our client base  expanding our outsourced third party provider base to assist in cost efficiently delivering our services and  growth through acquisition with complementary service providers and software product companies plan of operations we plan to establish a broad customer base by various traditional and internet marketing campaigns over the next twelve months we plan to   to support the delivery and manage the results of this approach we have developed a tool we refer to as our business innovation and growth big checkup     results of operations summary of key results for the unaudited three month periods ending march   and  revenues and cost of revenues total revenue for the three months ended march   and  was  versus  respectively revenues are from professional services the decline in revenue was due to the completion of various engagements the

march   we executed a promissory note for  our future growth in dependent upon achieving sales growth management of operating expenses and ability of the company to obtain the necessary financing to fund future obligations and upon profitable operations we believe we will require a minimum of  in additional cash over the next  months to maintain our regulatory reporting and filings and cover our operations costs should our revenues not increase as expected and if our costs and expenses prove to be greater than we currently anticipate or should we change our current business plan in a manner that will increase or accelerate our anticipated costs and expenses the depletion of our working capital would be accelerated in the event that our revenues from operations are insufficient to meet our working capital needs our major shareholder mountain laurel holdings inc has indicated that they may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a nonsecured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the company however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement management believes if the company cannot maintain its reporting status with the sec it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety consistent with section  of the delaware general corporation law it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the then existing directors are approved by vote of the stockholders or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is us at is authorized approved or ratified by the board we will conduct an appropriate review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis and where appropriate we review the potential of conflicts of interest offbalance sheet arrangements the company has no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the companys financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors the term offbalance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party under which the company has i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract derivative instrument or variable interest or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit liquidity or market risk support for such assets critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and income taxes these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported revenue

prospectus  this summary does not contain all the information that you should consider before investing in the common stock  you should carefully read the entire prospectus including “risk factors” “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements before making an investment decision we are a consulting company for the small business enterprise market hereinunder referred to as the “sme market”   in general sme market companies range from sole proprietors – the oneperson band running his or her business with no employees – through to those that have up to  employees    we target those sme companies with limited resources andor infrastructure looking to outsource their operations andor corporate level functions our “business services”  such business services might include financial reporting investor relations accounting sales and marketing compliance legal human resource management we also look to help clients identify implement and maintain thirdparty softwareasa service products that help streamline business operations through automation our “managed software services”    our business services and managed software services are collectively referred to as our services currently our services are provided to clients on a projectbased fee arrangement or a fixed term agreement with an initial retainer and monthly or periodic payments we believe that by combining our outsourced business consulting services and existing software tools in the marketplace we will help clients cost effectively and efficiently build and maintain their business plans   the company plans to become a public company the reason for becoming a public company is to attract capital to fund further expansion and the development of our services   many investors prefer to invest in public companies because they deem their investment to have more liquidity in their investment another reason for becoming public is to increase public awareness of the company   the negatives for being public are the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements audits and investor relations can be high we believe the additional costs associated with being public will range up to  per year this estimate could change dramatically depending on the level of our success the company the company’s officers and directors do not intend for the company once it is reporting to be used as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company since our inception july  through december   we have received over  in revenues    for the year ended december   we reported a profit of  and had working capital of   through the date of this report we have acquired  clients  two client’s represented approximately  and  of our revenue to date respectively and the remaining clients each represented  or less of our revenue   our initial activities focused on developing our delivery service model that will enable us to best service clients and scale as our client base grows     with our delivery system now developed we plan to focus our efforts on sales and marketing and setting up our decentralized service locations our working capital as of december   is  we project that our monthly expenditures burn rate is approximately  consisting of generally office overhead  in addition we project the cost of being a public company to be approximately  per month   thus our total monthly overhead is approximately  if we lose clients and are unable to continue to grow our revenue we estimate that we will exhaust our available capital within three to five months from the date of the financial statements december     for these and other reasons our independent auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   accordingly we may require additional financing including the debt or equity funding        we have no present plans to be acquired or to merge with another company nor do we nor any of our shareholders have any plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction we may as stated below under “our strategy” look to

     risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed please note that throughout this prospectus the words “we” “our” “us” or “resultsbased outsourcing” refer to the company and its subsidiaries and not to the selling stockholders risks related to our business we have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company   we were incorporated in delaware on july      although we are generating revenue we have no significant financial resources the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate since we have a limited operating history we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses and support our anticipated activities we depend on our sole director and officer ‘she” “her” and the loss of her services would force us to expend time and resources in pursuit of replacements which could adversely affect our business we consider our current director and officer to be essential to the success of the business   we have no employment contract with her and do not maintain key man life insurance on her   although she has not indicated any intention of leaving us if she did leave for any reason it could have very negative impact on our ability to fulfill our business plan          we may incur significant costs to be a public company to ensure compliance with us corporate governance and accounting requirements and we may not be able to absorb such costs   we may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect these costs to approximate  per year consisting of  in legal  in audit and  for edgar filing and transfer agent fees we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly  we may not be able to cover these costs from our operations and may need to raise or borrow additional funds  we also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage  as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs  in addition we may not be able to absorb these costs of being a public company which will negatively affect our business operations   our sole director and chief executive officer beneficially own’s approximately  of the shares of our common stock giving her control over decisions and her interest could conflict with the investors which could cause the investor to lose all or part of the investment   our sole director and chief executive officer owns approximately  of our issued and outstanding common stock  as such these officers have complete control over decisions including but not limited to all employment decisions appointment of other management positions and whether to enter into material transactions with related parties  such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control which may be to the benefit of our management but not in the interest of the shareholders this beneficial ownership and potential effective control on all matters relating to our business and operations could eliminate the possibility of shareholders changing the management in the event that the shareholders did not agree with the conduct of the officers and directors additionally the shareholders would potentially not be able to obtain the necessary shareholder vote to affect any change in the course of our business this lack of shareholder control could prevent the shareholders from removing from the board of directors any directors who are not managing the company with sufficient skill to make it profitable which could prevent us from becoming profitable   our sole director and chief executive officer intends to devote only part time efforts to our business may have conflicts of interests in allocating her time between our company and those of other businesses and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented which may not be sufficient to successfully develop our business   the amount of time our sole director and officer intends to devote to our business is limited currently expected to be approximately  of her working time to our company   she has other business interests although these business interests are not competitive to our operations  while we expect her to increase the percentage of the working time she devotes to our company if our operations increase the amount of time which she devotes to our business may not be sufficient to fully develop our business   additionally she may encounter a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and those of other businesses in the course of her other business activities she may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as other entities to which she owes a fiduciary duty   as a result she may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented  such conflicts of interests should they arise may be detrimental to our business          because our management does not have prior experience running a public company we may have to hire individuals or suspend or cease operations   because our management has limited prior experience in running a public company including the preparation of reports under the securities act of  we may have to hire additional experienced personnel to assist us with the preparation thereof if we need the additional experienced personnel and we do not hire them we could fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or cease operations entirely   because our officer and director has limited formal training or experience in financial accounting and management there may not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines penalties and assessments against us   our sole director and chief executiveofficerchief financial officer has limited formal training or experience in financial accounting and management however she responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of   while she has limited formal training in financial accounting matters and limited experience us generally accepted accounting principals she has been preparing the financial statements that have been audited and reviewed by our auditors and included in this prospectus when the disclosure and accounting controls referred to above are implemented she will be responsible for the administration of them  should she not have sufficient experience she may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls  lack of proper controls could cause our financial statements to be inaccurate which will give us an incorrect view of our financial condition and mislead us into believing our operations are being conducted correctly  as a result investors will be misled about our financial condition and the quality of our operations  this inaccurate reporting could cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the sec which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment however because of the small size of our expected operations we believe that she will be able to monitor the controls he will have created and will be accurate in assembling and providing information to investors   we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate which may adversely affect our stock price   we expect that our quarterly results will fluctuate significantly  we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful additionally if our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet securities analysts or your expectations the price of our common stock could decrease if our costs and expenses are greater than anticipated and we are unable to raise additional working capital we may be unable to fully fund our operations and to otherwise execute our business plan   we believe that our currently available working capital and current client base will be sufficient to continue our business for at least the next  to  months absent continuing revenue   should our costs and expenses prove to be greater than we currently anticipate or should we change our current business plan in a manner that will increase or accelerate our anticipated costs and expenses the depletion of our working capital would be accelerated  to the extent it becomes necessary to raise additional cash in the future as our current cash and working capital resources are depleted we will seek to raise it through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities funding from jointventure or strategic partners debt financing or shortterm loans or a combination of the foregoing  we may also seek to satisfy indebtedness without any cash outlay through the private issuance of debt or equity securities  we currently do not have any binding commitments for or readily available sources of additional financing  we cannot give you any assurance that we will be able to secure the additional cash or working capital we may require to continue our operations          if we require additional capital and even if we are able to raise additional financing we might not be able to obtain it on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome to the company or disadvantageous to our existing shareholders   if we require additional capital and even if we are able to raise additional cash or working capital through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities funding from jointventure or strategic partners debt financing or shortterm loans or the satisfaction of indebtedness without any cash outlay through the private issuance of debt or equity securities the terms of such transactions may be unduly expensive or burdensome to the company or disadvantageous to our existing shareholders for example we may be forced to sell or issue our securities at significant discounts to market or pursuant to onerous terms and conditions including the issuance of preferred stock with disadvantageous dividend voting or veto board membership conversion redemption or liquidation provisions the issuance of convertible debt with disadvantageous interest rates and conversion features the issuance of warrants with cashless exercise features the issuance of securities with antidilution provisions and the grant of registration rights with significant penalties for the failure to quickly register if we raise debt financing we may be required to secure the financing with all of our business assets which could be sold or retained by the creditor should we default in our payment obligations    a conflict of interest may arise with our consultant   we have entered into a consulting contract with the spouse of our sole directorofficer and majority stockholder’s spouse we believe this contract provides for terms which are customary in the industry however it may be considered a non arms length transaction due to the relationship of the parties as a result a potential conflict of interest between the interest of the company and that of the consultant which could have an adverse effect on our business   we face intense competition and operate in an industry with limited barriers to entry and most of our competitors are better positioned than we are   the startup emerging business professional services market is competitive with limited barriers to entry our competitors include established professional service providers including without limitation the boston consulting group kimley horn  associates tek systems  deloitte touche proviti  or manpower who have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing technical management and other resources than we do we expect competition will intensify in the future increased competition may result in reduced operating margins reduced profitability loss of market share and diminished brand recognition  these and other competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   risks related to our common stock you may not be able to liquidate your investment since there is no assurance that a public market will develop for our common stock or that our common stock will ever be approved for trading on a recognized exchange   there is no established public trading market for our securities  although we intend to be quoted on the otc qb tier of otc markets in the united states our shares are not and have not been quoted on any exchange or quotation system we cannot assure you that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the finra nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved or that a regular trading market will develop or that if developed will be sustained in the absence of a trading market an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment which will result in the loss of your investment           the offering price of the shares was solely determined based upon the price the shares were sold in the private placement and therefore should not be used as an indicator of the future market price of the securities therefore the offering price bears no relationship to the actual value of the company and may make our shares difficult to sell since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system the offering price of  for the shares of common stock was determined based upon the price the shares were sold to the investors in private placements of  plus an increase based on the fact the shares will be liquid and registered the facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market the offering price bears no relationship to the book value assets or earnings of our company or any other recognized criteria of value the offering price should not be regarded as an indicator of the future market price of the securities   should our stock become quoted on the otc qb tier of otc markets if we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements we could be removed from the otc qb which would limit the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market   companies quoted on the otc qb tier of otc markets such as we are seeking to become must be reporting issuers under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended and must be current in their reports under section  in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the otc qb if we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements we could be removed from the otc qb as a result the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market in addition we may be unable to get requoted on the otc qb which may have an adverse material effect on our company   once publicly trading the application of the “penny stock” rules could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares   the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule g which establishes the definition of a “penny stock” for the purposes relevant to us as any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or with an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require   ●  that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks and   ●  the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased          in order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must   ●  obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and   ●  make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks   the broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the commission relating to the penny stock market which in highlight form   ●  sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and   ●  that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction   generally brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules this may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock   disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions finally monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks   we do not expect to pay dividends in the future any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock   we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future the payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant our current intention is to apply net earnings if any in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts there can be no assurance that the company will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock and in any event a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors if we do not pay dividends our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates          our common stock price is likely to be highly volatile which may subject us to securities litigation thereby diverting our resources which may affect our profitability and results of operation   the market price for our common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general and the market for internetrelated stocks     the following factors will add to our common stock prices volatility   ●  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results ●  announcements by us of acquisitions ●  additions or departures of our key personnel and ●  sales of our common stock   many of these factors are beyond our control these factors may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance   in the past plaintiffs have initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities  we may in the future be the target of similar litigation  securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention and resources   reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to       ●   have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act   ●   comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis   ●   submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and   ●   disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceos compensation to median employee compensation     in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five full fiscal years although if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of any january  before that time we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following december  or if our annual revenues exceed  billion we would cease to be an emerging growth company the following fiscal year or if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a threeyear period we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately     notwithstanding the above we also are currently a smaller reporting company meaning that we are not an investment company an assetbacked issuer nor a majorityowned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and has a public float of less than  million and annual revenues of less than  million during the most recently completed fiscal year if we are still considered a smaller reporting company at such time as we cease to be an emerging growth company we will be subject to increased disclosure requirements however the disclosure requirements will still be less than they would be if we were not considered either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company specifically similar to emerging growth companies smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings are exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are not required to conduct sayonpay and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after january   and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their sec filings including among other things only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports decreased disclosures in its sec filings due to its status as an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company may make us less attractive to investors given that it will be harder for investors to analyze the companys results of operations and financial prospects and as a result it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it   use of proceeds the selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this prospectus for their own account we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders determination of offering price since our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system the offering price of the shares of common stock of  was determined as the selling price based upon the original purchase price paid by certain selling shareholders of  plus an increase based on the fact the shares will be liquid and registered the offering price of the shares of our common stock has been determined arbitrarily by us and does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value assets past operating results financial condition or any other established criteria of value the facts considered in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange we will be filing to obtain a listing on the otc qb tier of otc markets in order to be quoted on the otc qb a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with finra nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved in addition there is no assurance that our common stock will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering price as prices for the common stock in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors including the depth and liquidity        dilution the common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued accordingly there will be no dilution to our existing shareholders   penny stock considerations our common stock will be a penny stock therefore trading in our securities is subject to penny stock considerations brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the brokerdealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our securities which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock   state securities  blue sky laws    there is no public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that any market will develop in the foreseeable future transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities regulations or laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions commonly referred to as “blue sky” laws absent compliance with such individual state laws our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue sky laws of any state the holders of such

investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities accordingly investors may not be able to liquidate their investments and should be prepared to hold the shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time   selling security holders may contact us directly to ascertain procedures necessary for compliance with blue sky laws in the applicable states relating to sellers andor purchasers of our shares of common stock   limitations imposed by regulation m   under applicable rules and regulations under the securities exchange act of  as amended any person

stock  par value per share and  shares of preferred stock    common stock   as of the date hereof  shares of common stock are issued and outstanding     the holders of our common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our board of directors and are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation dissolution or winding up of our affairs our common stock does not provide the right to a preemptive subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights our common stock holders are entitled to one noncumulative vote per share on all matters on which shareholders may vote   we refer you to our articles of incorporation bylaws and the applicable statutes of the state of delaware for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities  all material terms of our common stock have been addressed in this section   holders of shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights which means that the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors to be elected if they so choose and in that event the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors          holders   as of the date hereof we have  shareholders holding  shares of our issued and outstanding common stock dividend policy   it is unlikely that we will declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future we intend to retain earnings if any to expand our operations to date we have paid no dividends on our shares of common stock and have no present intention of paying any dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future the payment by us of dividends on the shares of common stock in the future if any rests solely within the discretion of our board of directors and

additional shares of preferred stock could be used as an antitakeover measure antitakeover measures may result in you receiving less compensation for your stock   the issuance of preferred stock creates additional securities with dividend and liquidation preferences over common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control without further security holder action and may adversely affect the rights and powers including voting rights of the holders of common stock in certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could depress the market price of the

audited by rosenberg rich baker berman  co independent registered public accounting firm to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report appearing elsewhere herein and in the registration statement and are included in reliance on such report given the authority of said firm as an expert in auditing and accounting          description of business we are a consulting company for the small business enterprise market hereinunder referred to as the “sme market”   in general sme market companies range from sole proprietors – the oneperson band running his or her business with no employees – through to those that have up to  employees    we target those sme companies with limited resources andor infrastructure looking to outsource their operations andor corporatelevel functions our “business services”  our business services might include financial reporting accounting sales and marketing compliance legal human resource management or investor relations we also look to help clients identify implement and maintain thirdparty softwareasa service products that help streamline business operations through automation our “managed software services”    our business services and managed software services are collectively referred to as our services   currently we provide our services on a projectbased fee arrangement or a recurring monthly charge   we believe that by combining our outsourced business consulting services and existing software tools in the marketplace we will help clients cost effectively and efficiently build and maintain their business plans our market   within the sme market classification there are considerable company variation  there are hundreds if not thousands of types of small businesses   just taking the naics the north american industry classification system or the sic codes the uk standard industrial classification there are over  classifications of business types from suppliers of asbestos products to xray apparatus   however we try to collapse these many categories into three broad groups   ●  companies that produce manufacture or process things   ●  companies that retail distribute or merchant things or   ●  companies that offer professional advice or knowledgebased services   within sme market we understand that the sole proprietor is very different to the company that employs  people   we believe enterprises experience a change of focus once they employ just a few people   once an enterprise employs additional staff we believe management begins to place more emphasis on the subject of revenue growth and expense management   we use a business life cycle approach and consider how the needs of sme businesses change as they grow and mature within the cycle          a framework for such thinking about this is presented in figure  below   figure      our opportunity   sme company owners and managers often are tasked with functioning in a number of capacities in order to grow their business   however at some point in time in the growth curve figure  a business owner or manager is faced with the decision of continuing to function in a number of capacities or to seek outside assistance to help with this decision we bring outsourced people business processes and software tools to businesses to reduce costs and to run more efficiently and effectively  we believe that if a small business doesn’t embrace and leverage the power of outsourcing and automation it significantly limits the company’s ability to keep pace with business growth goals and objectives    as such we believe that our  services met a large unmet need for sme companies   the sme market is particularly attractive because     ●  it is large continues to grow and remains underserved by professional services companies and     ●  it typically has fewer inhouse resources than larger businesses and as a result is generally more dependent on external resources          our strategy      our strategy for growing our operations includes   ●  rolling out various outbound sales and marketing campaigns to grow our client base   ●  expanding our outsourced consultant base to assist in cost efficiently delivering our services and   ●  growth through acquisition or strategic reseller agreements with complementary service providers and software product companies          our clients and client contracts currently our services are provided to clients on a projectbased fee arrangement or a fixed term agreement with an initial retainer and monthly or periodic payments    our client relationships are codified in a client services agreement generally the agreements permits cancellation by either party upon  days’ written notice   in addition we may terminate the agreement at any time for specified breach of contract including nonpayment or failure to follow our workplace safety recommendations   the client services agreement also provides for indemnification of us by the client against losses arising out of any default by the client under the agreement including failure to comply with any employmentrelated health and safety or immigration laws or regulations   as of the date of this prospectus we have agreements with  client companies   since inception we have had eleven different clients   competition the business environment in which we operate is characterized by intense competition and fragmentation  we are not aware of reliable statistics regarding the number of its competitors but certain large wellknown companies typically compete with us in the same markets and also have greater financial and marketing resources than we do including automatic data processing inc manpower inc kelly services inc insperity inc trinet group inc and paychex inc we may face additional competition in the future from new entrants to the field including other staffing services companies payroll processing companies and insurance companies the principal competitive factors in the business environment in which we operate are price and level of service   our sales and marketing plans initial marketing efforts will be geared toward raising awareness of our services  this will primarily be accomplished by standard lead generation activities such as payperclick advertising search engine optimization and standard email phone call and letter correspondence to targeting client listing   we anticipate that in the future our clients will be a good resource for referring clients to the business   we believe the sme market is easier to reach than mediumlarge corporate organizations  the small size makes them more accessible  in most cases the business owner controls the checkbook very often answers the phone and generally makes quick decisions   most sme market businesses can be easily found in directories    in many countries they receive a free and automatic entry into the commercial yellow pages  they also can be found in accessible databases owned by companies such as experian or dun  bradstreet from these sources lists can be acquired for a fee  for a relatively small budget we can gain access to thousands of names of sme market target clients to a specification of choice description of our services   for definition and delivery process design we have categorized our outsourcing services into two products    the services maybe combined or delivered separately      business process outsourcing “bpo” brings people and business processes to clients    bpo solutions range from providing selected business process services to providing entire back office and department support   clients needs for business process outsourcing may be as simple as interim staff support or as complex as a complete outsourcing of their department functions with highlevel support and oversight by experts     software managed outsourcing “smo” bring currently available third party software products to clients     smo is an essential tool for small businesses looking to run more efficiently and effectively   through this strategy businesses don’t have to make the permanent large investment of purchasing software instead they pay a monthly fee for a cloud based third party software delivered through the internet   more about business process outsourcing bpo          the very idea of outsourcing may scare clients since it involves handing away the responsibilities of a part of your business to someone else who is not even on location while we don’t recommend clients outsource the very core of their company there are ways that outsourcing certain parts which can have great benefits including     ●  allowing businesses to centralize the important operations       ●  ensuring business finance and accounting will be best taken care of when handed to a professional instead of businesses trying to do their own books they can hire a quality accountant and trust that the books are being done right       ●  saving money since businesses will be freeing up employee time to handle the integral parts of your business they can save a money and       ●  leaving the professional jobs to the professionals chances are there are certain aspects of a business that are being handled by people who do not specialize in that area this could lead to subpar work simply because the employee is not properly trained            we recommend that the primary areas a business should look to outsource are   ●  financial reporting accounting  bookkeeping   ●  sales  marketing   ●  legal and compliance and   ●  human resource management   more about software managed outsourcing smo   evaluating thirdparty software products can be a daunting task for management how do you choose the right software or app for your organization how do you sort through the marketing and sales hype and how can you tell which vendor will be with you for the long haul and which will disappear after the sale            these are just some of the questions business owners and managers face when evaluating technology solutions to business problems we believe most businesses never thought of all the options they have to reap the benefits of offtheshelve software applications we continue to develop our master database of recommended software applications the basic categories of software tools we screen for potential use include     ●  collaboration software         ●  customer management software       ●  finance  accounting software       ●    hr  employee management software       ●  integration solutions software       ●    internet  online software       ●  communications software       ●  it management software       ●  marketing software       ●  operations management software       ●    project management  planning software       ●  sales software          how we engage clients    so that we ensure a proper match of our services with a client’s needs we require clients to complete initial engagement sizing questionnaires     below we have included screen shots and expanded three of the areas noted as an example area   online revenue generation area  – noncore expense management and area  – insurance optimization    for complete online forms refer to our website at wwwrboutsourcingcom                            as part of our client engagement delivery process as applicable we have

performancebased management grader    overall revenue maturity grader    overall revenue checkup the purpose of these grading tools are to identify those areas where a client has policy and procedure weaknesses and allow us to better focus our services to target the quickest improvements which save money and increase revenue   below we have provided snapshots of our online grading tools     for

results can be affected by the seasonal fluctuations in client expenditures   expenditures in the outsourced business consulting and the purchase of managed software products can be negatively impacted during the first quarter of the year when clients are finalizing their budgets   quarterly results generally fluctuate depending on among other things the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of clients’ businesses the business is also affected by the timing of holidays and seasonal vacation patterns generally resulting in lower revenues and gross profit in the fourth quarter of each year not considering any nonseasonal impact extreme weather conditions may also affect demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year as certain clients’ facilities are located in geographic areas subject to closure or reduced hours due to inclement weather   government regulations the company is a consulting and  is generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation  regulation of the employeremployee relationship between a firm and its employees including tax withholding or reporting social security or retirement benefits workplace
