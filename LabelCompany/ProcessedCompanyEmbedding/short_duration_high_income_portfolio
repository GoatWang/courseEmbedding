trailed the  gain of its highyieldonly benchmark given the rally in higheryielding securities an underweighting in higherquality bbrated highyield bonds contributed to the funds performance versus its benchmark on october   matthew bartlett became coportfolio manager of the fund replacing michael plage qa an interview with lead portfolio manager matthew conti and coportfolio manager matthew bartlett q matt how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending april   mc nearly all the funds share classes excluding sales charges if applicable gained roughly  the past  months about in line with the fidelity short duration high income composite indexsm the funds investments in each of three shortduration asset classes – high yield bonds investmentgrade bonds and bank loans – outperformed their respective market indexes but highyield bonds rallied sharply this period and the fund trailed the  return of its highyieldonly benchmark im generally pleased that my morecautious approach toward credit risk – which has proven a sound strategy over the longer term – held up reasonably well despite a riskdriven market rally led by lowerquality bonds q please tell us more about your strategy and how it played out the past  months mc in managing the fund my mandate is to generate high income with a typical duration of three years or less consistent with my core highyield investment approach the fund remains primarily invested in highyield bonds which represented about  of fund assets the past  months during the period i pared the funds exposure to highyield bonds somewhat while i increased bank debt as of april  the funds allocation to bank debt represents a significant overweighting versus our neutral weighting of  also i maintained negligible exposure to convertible securities and equities given the funds neutral allocation of  to highyield bonds the majority of the portfolio typically represents securities rated bb and b similar to our benchmark at the end of the reporting period more than  of the fund had a rating of bb or lower as a result the fund was underweighted the  neutral allocation to corporate investmentgrade shortduration securities in managing the fund i apply intensive bottomup fundamental credit research with an additional goal of producing portfolio duration of less than three years liquidity analysis is a unique factor i consider since many bonds will be held until they are called or mature mitigating default risk is important to keep the funds steady income flow as maturities approach i invest in companies that i believe are likely to reduce their debt and that i think can withstand challenges such as a bad quarter an economic dip a secular headwind or increased competition i place great emphasis on free cash flow which in my opinion is the only means by which companies can organically improve their balance sheets i look for companies that not only generate free cash flow but also plan to use it to reduce debt a firm not generating enough cash to meet its obligations needs to issue more debt in turn eroding its creditworthiness i focus on bonds with reliable income and the select few backed by companies that i consider worthy of eventually receiving a creditrating upgrade q turning to you matthew how did your investmentgrade bond subportfolio fare mb the fund typically holds about  of its assets in investmentgrade bonds the past year however the fund had an allocation of  on average as matt noted this allocation posted a positive absolute result but nonetheless dampened results versus the benchmark because higheryielding assets were much stronger compared with the rest of the portfolio the investmentgrade allocation should help dampen volatility while over time providing the opportunity for excess return through security selection i manage the subportfolio using the same process i employ in managing other fidelity investmentgrade bond funds capitalizing on our worldclass team of analysts and traders i identify issuers offering stabletoimproving credit metrics with bonds trading at what we believe are attractive valuations q back to you matt what factors at a sectorindustry level had the biggest influence on the funds relative performance mc positive security selection overall led by energy and gaming aided the funds performance versus its benchmark favorable positioning in telecom provided a further boost versus the benchmark among our core highyield investments a sizable underweighting in metalsmining – one of the topperforming groups this period – was the biggest negative i underweighted metalsmining because i thought other parts of the market offered opportunities that better fit my strategy q you noted that you increased the funds allocation to bank loans mc yes i increased our bankloan allocation from  of the portfolio at the beginning of the period to about  by april  on the view that they offered better relative value than investmentgrade debt this period moreover another element of my strategy is to try to protect the portfolio against rising interest rates bank loans typically benefit from rising rates because their stated interest rates adjust higher as market interest rates move up with policy rates at recordlow levels this added rate protection is aligned with the funds charter q which individual investments had the greatest impact on relative performance mc chesapeake energy proved to be a productive holding it made substantial progress improving its balance sheet after posting several consecutive quarters of lower perunit operating expenses industry fundamentals were in the firms favor as projected demand for natural gas outstripped supply boosting prices in health care our caution proved advantageous with hospital operator hca which we underweighted as the ultimate fate of the affordable care act weighed on its bonds the past  months not owning copper miner and index component first quantum minerals until late in the period proved a mistake as the bonds rallied amid a rebound in copper prices lastly our large holding in american airlines lagged because rising fuel prices nicked cash flow and industry sentiment turned negative i still believe the credit is solid and industry conditions are supportive for rational capacity growth and steady cash flows q whats your outlook as of april  matt mc as we enter the later phase of this economic cycle i believe shortduration highyield corporate bonds are wellpositioned with strong liquidity at the corporate level shorterduration securities can not only reduce interest rate risk but can also minimize credit risk given their priority in being paid off by issuers the next stage of the highyield market environment could lean favorably into my longterm strategy less correlation means companyspecific factors should become more dominant in determining highyield bond prices given my researchdriven securityselection process the inherent structure of the fund should be positioned to provide reliable income with relatively low volatility ■ matt conti on highyield bonds in a lowvolatility environment vix also known colloquially as the fear gauge is a key measure of market volatility vix is the ticker symbol for the chicago board of options cboe volatility index the vix is constructed using the implied volatilities of a wide range of sp ® index options it is a key indicator of the level of volatility expected in the stock market over the next  days and stock market volatility is normally seen as a proxy for other risk assets such as highyield bonds during the month reporting period the vix trended lower and on may   closed at  its lowest level in more than  years this movement lower in the vix coincided with a continuation of strong performance for highyield bonds historically a low vix level has been correlated with periods of relatively rich valuations for highyield bonds this is partly explained by investor complacency as the values of risk securities become increasingly elevated indeed as of period end the valuation of the highyield market as measured by the yield advantage offered by the asset class versus us treasuries could be characterized as rich or full does a fully valued highyield market mean that a correction is just around the corner not necessarily history has shown that relatively tight spreads and low volatility can persist for extended periods of time so while i believe a low vix implies that a cautious approach to market risk may be prudent it does not necessarily signal an imminent change in market performance market recap fueled by a resurgence in investor risk appetite us corporate highyield bonds gained  for the year ending april   as measured by the bofa merrill lynchsm us high yield constrained index early on high yield benefited from a revival in oil markets and strengthening macro tailwinds following a brief latejune disruption related to britains vote to exit the european union brexit high yield resumed its rally through the end of october the asset class suffered a slight downturn in november – its first negative month since january  – as interest rates spiked following the us elections and oil prices were volatile due to uncertainty about production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec however the energyheavy index strengthened by month end amid optimism following opecs first production cut since  the rally continued through february aided by investor optimism despite few specifics on the new administrations plans but retreated a bit in march before resuming the uptrend reflecting a more favorable environment for riskier assets lowerquality bonds within the index fared best

products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  the day sec yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements if applicable  the unsubsidized day sec yield is calculated the same as the day sec yield however it excludes contractual fee waivers and expense reimbursements  distribution rate is calculated by dividing the funds most recent ordinary distribution paid or declared on an annualized basis by the nav price distribution rates may vary  a measure of a bonds sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bonds price given a change in yield it accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements senior loans have an effective duration close to zero for purposes of calculating an effective duration for senior loans a duration of  is assumed  the annualized return that would be earned on a debt security if held to maturity weighted by the value of each debt security in the funds portfolio the calculation does not include the effect of fund fees and expenses  the average number of days until the floating component of a loan resets  a shortterm funding rate estimated by banks in london that they would be charged if borrowing from other banks assuming a three month maturity  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change  inception date is  you should consider the funds investment objectives risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing you can download a prospectus or summary prospectus or contact first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund the prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing the fund is subject to the following risks you could lose money by investing in the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency bank loans risk an investment in bank loans subjects the fund to credit risk which is heightened for bank loans in which the fund invests because companies that issue such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the risks of interest deferral default andor bankruptcy senior floating rate loans in which the fund may invest are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these senior floating rate loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments an economic downturn would generally lead to a higher nonpayment rate and a senior floating rate loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs moreover any specific collateral used to secure a senior floating rate loan may decline in value or become illiquid which would adversely affect the senior floating rate loans value unlike the securities markets there is no central clearinghouse for loan trades and the loan market has not established enforceable settlement standards or remedies for failure to settle therefore portfolio transactions in senior floating rate loan may have uncertain settlement time periods senior floating rate loans are subject to a number of risks described elsewhere in this prospectus including liquidity risk and the risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income instruments furthermore increases in interest rates may result in greater volatility of senior floating rate loans and average duration may fluctuate with fluctuations in interest rates call risk if an issuer calls higheryielding debt instruments held by the fund performance could be adversely impacted convertible bonds risk the market values of convertible bonds tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline a convertible bonds market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company credit risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security may be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments credit risk may be heightened for the fund because it invests a substantial portion of its net assets in high yield or junk debt such securities while generally offering higher yields than investment grade debt with similar maturities involve greater risks including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral default or bankruptcy and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal credit risk is heightened for loans in which the fund invests because companies that issue such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the risks of interest deferral default andor bankruptcy currency risk because the funds net asset value is determined on the basis of us dollars and the fund invests in nonus dollar denominated securities you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the us dollar even if the local currency value of the funds holdings goes up the fund may hedge certain of its nonus dollar holdings cyber security risk as the use of internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business the fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber security a breach in cyber security refers to both intentional and unintentional events that may cause the fund to lose proprietary information suffer data corruption or lose operational capacity such events could cause the fund to incur regulatory penalties reputational damage additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures andor financial loss cyber security breaches may involve unauthorized access to the funds digital information systems through hacking or malicious software coding but may also result from outside attacks such as denialofservice attacks through efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users in addition cyber security breaches of the funds third party service providers such as its administrator transfer agent custodian or subadvisor as applicable or issuers in which the fund invests can also subject the fund to many of the same risks associated with direct cyber security breaches the fund has established risk management systems designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber security however there is no guarantee that such efforts will succeed especially because the fund does not directly control the cyber security systems of issuers or third party service providers high yield securities risk high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore are considered to be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations andor other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity if the economy slows down or dips into recession the issuers of high yield securities may not have sufficient resources to continue making timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities high yield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the overthecounter markets due to the smaller less liquid market for high yield securities the bidoffer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete in general high yield securities may have a greater risk of default than other types of securities illiquid securities risk illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books income risk if interest rates fall the income from the funds portfolio will likely decline if the fund holds floating rate debt that will adjust lower with falling interest rates for loans interest rates typically reset periodically interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the debt securities in the fund will decline because of rising market interest rates interest rate risk is generally lower for shorterterm investments and higher for longerterm investments duration is a measure of the expected price volatility of a debt instrument as a result of changes in market rates of interest based on among other factors the weighted average timing of the instruments expected principal and interest payments in general duration represents the expected percentage change in the value of a security for an immediate  change in interest rates therefore prices of debt securities with shorter durations tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than debt securities with longer durations as the value of a debt security changes over time so will its duration liquidity risk the fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in lowerquality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged lowerquality debt tends to be less liquid than higherquality debt moreover smaller debt issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues if the economy experiences a sudden downturn or if the debt markets for such companies become distressed the fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in sufficient amounts at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by fund shareholders management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it has an actively managed portfolio the portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund but there can be no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment objectives market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund or shares of the fund in general may fall in value securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic political regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of the fund could decline in value or underperform other investments nonus securities risk nonus securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political social or economic developments restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities lack of liquidity currency exchange rates excessive taxation government seizure of assets different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries other debt securities risk secured loans that are not first lien loans unsecured loans and other debt securities are subject to many of the same risks that affect senior loans however they are often unsecured andor lower in the issuers capital structure than senior loans and thus may be exposed to greater risk of default and lower recoveries in the event of a default this risk can be further heightened in the case of below investment grade instruments additionally most fixed income securities are fixedrate and thus are generally more susceptible than floating rate loans to price volatility related to changes in prevailing interest rates prepayment risk loans and other fixed income investments are subject to prepayment risk the degree to which borrowers prepay loans whether as a contractual requirement or at their election may be affected by general business conditions the financial condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors among others as such prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy upon a prepayment either in part or in full the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan  morningstar inc all rights reserved the morningstar ratingtm information contained herein  is

rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

overview objective the investment seeks to generate a high level of current income strategy under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in fixed income securities and loans issued by companies that are rated below investment grade it generally invests in high yield instruments rated ccc or better by sp or moodys the fixed income securities and loans in which the manager expects to invest include traditional corporate bonds us government obligations and bank loans to corporate borrowers and may have fixed floating or variable rates risk the fund may invest in lowerquality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials

avg high low this fund scores low because morningstar has rated its risk below the th percentile when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other
