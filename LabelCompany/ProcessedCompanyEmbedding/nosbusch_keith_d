d nosbusch president rockwell automation control systems spoke to control engineering at automation fair   dec   in long beach calif excerpts follow q please discuss several things in rockwell automations past that have become vital in where the company stands today and how its positioned for the future there are many areas we could discuss ill highlight four  forming an independent software business this helped us focus on a very important portion of company development mindset and culture to succeed in the software business  deciding to open up our networks historically weve had a proprietary environment with tendency to enjoy protection from competitors weve had to consider what customers needed and how we could address their needs open networks required that we open up and compete in a different way at the time not everyone agreed thats how we should have proceeded it has since proven to be a smart move with formation of open devicenet vendor association and the controlnet international organization leading to the entire concept of open automation the decision to be open in the broader prospective bodes well for us in the future its really changed the tone of whats happening in the company  splitting business with services independent of rockwell automation products this helps us meet customer needs and expand the scope of services to customers any time anywhere in the world  forming sourcealliancecom  which provides a very strong leadership position for integrated supply of electrical commodities customers were seeking ability to buy from the electrical category of products from one source as we did with the formation of devicenet and controlnet organizations well be the catalyst for an independent organization but then will step away from having controlling interest this is a forwardthinking move without consideration to protecting the past we think we should provide leadership in this area q what are key factors in customers environments today influencing how rockwell automation goes to market theres more effort put into solving and meeting customers business needs and problems were less focused on products for products sake many customers dont have a large engineering staff and are looking for suppliers to provide that expertise allowing customers to focus on core competitiveness we have to help customers examine the total cost of ownership as a company were moving beyond acquisitions to sell across the businesses creating solutions at higher levels in customers companies mainly weve focused on the plant floor now its the ceo and cfo as well theres great value and impact resulting from integrating customer processes at multiple levels a lot of customers are looking to consolidate their customer base and reduce costs q isnt it a dichotomy that customers would seek more open systems and fewer suppliers wouldnt a goal of embracing open systems be to have more suppliers customers want a singlepoint of responsibility openness helps create the best value propositionhaving the ability to replace a vendor creates leverage the threat is healthy if we dont have the best product then customers can go elsewhere such a structure drives costs out of customers systems when you drill down to what customers really want its a single point of response its like the cold war premise of trust but verify to adapt rockwell automation has been changing and reshaping changing our culture and driving to the new model weve initiated the process of continual growth and as a company have done a very good job of it a number of times one good example is the transition from electromechanical to solidstate to software and the expansion into services well continue to take advantage of market changes and never lose focus on the customer and the need for the customer to be successful we need to respond to customer needs listen and never be arrogant id like to think that whatever happens in this company no one would ever get fired for helping a customer if we take care of customers theyll reward us we have thousands of stories of how our people have gone to extraordinary means to care for customers q how do industrial networks fit into the open concept netlinx provides common services while remaining mediaindependent from device through the internet via devicenet controlnet and ethernet a common set of services can run on all of them with producerconsumer technology providing a seamless migration between this is an important differentiation we have in the marketplace weve seen global acceptance of our network strategyopen using commercially available protocols its a great competitive advantage for customers to get at any information from anywhere in the architecture were not afraid of ethernet on the factory floor youve now seen our first ethernet plc not a demo but a robust solution for sale now q what are some other technologies or products changing how customers think about and implement automation and control solutions the next evolution is tying the shop floor to business systems to improve the agility of customers the next thrust for customers and the company is in the services side integration and asset management helping them to do things in their facilities and on the plant floor in addition our control platform integrates multiple disciplines driving out cost and improving time to market there are so many great technology examples i get in trouble when i start naming them because someone always feels left out some of many current technology examples at the show here include manufacturing businessware rslogix rslinx the powerflex family of drives and zeroforce touch buttons q what are among the most difficult challenges for customers today what advice or assistance can you offer with the accelerated pace of technology suppliers are being asked to do more fewer customers are automation or technology experts nor do they want to be experts were helping customers connect to product information among our whatnext internet efforts rockwell automation has augmented its own ebusiness site wwwrockwellautomationcom  while orchestrating the multivendor supersite wwwsourcealliancecom  on our site weve added another way for customers to access the distribution channel more than  of our distribution channel supports what were doing continued success requires change in how we do business we cant just ignore these changes or they would have passed us bywere making these changes in conjunction with our distribution channel local sources provide pre and postsale services these changes make customers more effective in assets and inventory and they lower transaction costs ecommerce will play a role but no one can predict how its going to end up web sites are more than just selling going to a site is become an experience providing information and selfhelp were not focused on moving all business to direct internetbased sales we want to enable customers and the distribution channel to be more effective this is one way to help serve customers and distributorsabout keith d nosbusch president rockwell automation control systems

rockwell automation manufacturers will not move back to the us for political reasons rockwell automation chairman and ceo keith nosbusch recently gave an interview to china business news one of the most influential business newspapers in china with a circulation of  below is the english translation of the full article american manufacturing reflux and american reindustrialization have become buzzwords over the past two years the third industrial revolution represented by d printing and smart manufacturing seems to provide an unprecedented opportunity for american reindustrialization as the most important manufacturing base in the world will china’s position be threatened in a recent interview with china business news keith nosbusch chairman and ceo rockwell automation commented that businesses will not pull back manufacturing facilities to the united states for political reasons if they do move them back they do it because of economic reasons he added that though american politicians can do some lobbying it only works when they can create an environment for business success decisionmakers of large enterprises are pursuing bigger economic benefits and higher competitiveness especially in the long term last year end tim cook apple ceo expressed that they will make big investments to rebuild their imac production line in the us which generated big concern in the industry as a member of the council on competitiveness keith d nosbusch commented that it is key for businesses to be close to their customers for apple it has a big customer base in the united states but most of its current manufacturing is done outside of the united states so its natural for apple to pull some of its manufacturing back to the us many american businesses set up their manufacturing facilities in china not purely because china has cheap labor but also because they believe china will be a huge consumption market he added rockwell automation has been promoting smart manufacturing over the past two years it defines smart manufacturing as a highly connected and knowledgeenabled industrial enterprise where all business and operating actions are optimized to achieve substantially enhanced productivity sustainability and economic performance with regard to whether smart manufacturing will be adopted at the same pace in the worlds three biggest economies the us europe and china keith said no matter in what regions of the world we are still in the early phases of smart manufacturing i believe that smart manufacturing will progress at different rates in different industries not in different regions countries that face global competition or want to supply their products globally will move faster to adopt and develop smart manufacturing china is now undergoing an economic transformation and evolving from the madeinchina period if china can be one of the first to achieve manufacturing knowledge it will earn a longterm competitive advantage well
