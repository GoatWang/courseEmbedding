historical fact and involve certain risks and uncertainties as well as assumptions actual results levels of activity performance achievements and events could differ materially from those stated anticipated or implied by such forwardlooking statements while freshpet believes that its assumptions are reasonable it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and of course it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results there are several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements made

nongaap financial measures” should be considered as supplements to the gaap reported measures should not be considered replacements for or superior to the gaap measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies adjusted gross profitadjusted gross profit as a  of net sales adjusted gross marginadjusted sga adjusted sga as a  of net salesebitdaadjusted ebitda

loss plus depreciation and amortization interest expense and income tax expense and adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus loss on disposal of equipment plant startup expense sharebased compensation warrant fair valuation secondary fees leadership transition expenses and launch expenses management believes that the nongaap measures are meaningful to investors because they provide a view of the company with respect to ongoing operating results the nongaap financial measures are shown as supplemental disclosures in this release because they are widely used by the investment community for analysis and comparative evaluation and provides additional metrics to evaluate the company’s operations and when considered with both the company’s gaap results and the reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measures provides a more complete understanding of the company’s business than could be obtained absent this disclosure the nongaap measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable gaap measures or any other figure calculated in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of operating performance the company’s calculation of the nongaap financial measures may differ from methods used by other companies management believes that the nongaap measures are important to an understanding of the companys overall operating results in the periods presented the nongaap financial measures are not recognized in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to gaap measures of performance  freshpet inc and
