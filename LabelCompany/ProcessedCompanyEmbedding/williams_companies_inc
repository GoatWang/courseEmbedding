textiles inc as a manufacturer of medical products such items as patient gowns adult bibs operation room apparel and other supplies needed by hospitals and nursing homes  we manufactured and distributed our products in the north and south carolina  for many years williams medical textiles inc grew and began to diversify its product line bringing in disposable diapers and underpads by the truckload  williams medical textiles inc began to learn of the exportation of diapers and the need of this product in other countries  with that new development the company began to learn and inquire more about exporting  years later with exporting products as our main lifeline williams medical textiles inc begun to develop business relationships with several overseas companies  those customers began inquiring about other products and wanted to know if our company could locate such merchandise to be shipped overseas  we continued to grow as did the offices manufacturing plant and warehouses that we were using  with the exporting at hand we were forced to build more warehouses in order to meet the demands of our customer’s orders  we continued to manufacture and distribute medical products to north carolina and south carolina area hospitals and nursing homes through williams medical textiles incas our companies flourished we created an inhouse freight company rj transports inc to handle all of our transportation needs  over the years rj transports inc grew from one tractor and trailer to owning seven tractors and approximately  trailers  the need for this large number of trailers came from the growing demand of our customers to provide them with larger amounts of used clothing shoes belts purses toys and other used materials sent to countries less fortunate than the united states  value clothing inc  was established with a foundation in exporting used clothing and shoes as main products  during our growth value clothing inc began to help those less fortunate right here in north carolina and our surrounding states  as community thrift stores become over ran with clothing shoes belts purses toys etc our company purchases the products from them  this in turn helps the thrift store to liquidate their stock that they can not sell and use the funds in their community workproduct exportation is the lifeline of williams companies inc  due to enormous business developments we have built more warehouses offices and manufacturing plants  our company recently expanded operations from advance north carolina to salisbury north carolina in order to better serve
