are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs

credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between

morningstar calculates a morningstar rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure against other funds in the same category this measure takes into account variations

increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of

longterm investing approach has historically resulted in a lower than average portfolio turnover ratio results hypothetical k investment investing in the fund what are the risks all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and can reduce returns because the fund may invest its assets in companies in a specific region including europe it is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region andor the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically current political and financial uncertainty surrounding the european union may increase market volatility and the economic risk of investing in companies in europe derivatives including currency management strategies involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses as well as enable gains on an amount that exceeds the funds initial investment the fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as

nav the primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the nav and the closing price of the fund since shares of the fund trade on the open market prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors corporations and financial institutions depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment shares of the fund may deviate slightly from the value of the funds underlying assets as a result shareholders may pay more than nav when they buy fund shares and receive less than nav when they sell those shares because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices however due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to etfs market makers are able to minimize these deviations from nav by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities what causes these time discrepancies close of trading times although both the nav and the closing trade of the fund are generally calculated at the closing time of  pm eastern time slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies time of last trade trading of global x funds generally takes place during normal trading hours  am to  pm eastern time however it is important to note that the last trade  from which the closing price is determined  may not occur at exactly  pm eastern time therefore changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the nav to deviate from the closing price international holdings the premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets because the funds trade during us market hours while the underlying securities may not the time lapse between the markets can result in differences
