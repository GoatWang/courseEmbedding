pea which erin ventures expects to release sometime in the current quarter boron most people have likely never heard of this industrial mineral yet it is used in no fewer than  products including nine grams of it in the gorilla glass contained in every apple ipad it is also utilized extensively in ceramics fibreglass insulation fertilizer silicon sports equipment nuclear reactors lithium batteries heat shields and medicines keep up to date with breaking news commentaries and interviews by following erin ventures hereaccording to the united states geological survey usgs global consumption of bo boron trioxide is projected to reach  million tonnes in  up from  million tonnes in  china is currently the world’s largest consumer of boron minerals with demand increasing by  annually from  to  on the supply side about  of the world’s annual output comes from just two industry players – rio tinto subsidiary us borax with its mine in california and the government controlled eti mine in turkey this is due to the fact that economic deposits of boron are so rare believing it could become an important part of the boron supply chain is canadian company erin ventures inc tsxv ev which is currently developing its piskanja property in serbia company president tim daniels saw opportunity in serbia which has a long rich history in mining as far back as  with the collapse of communism in eastern europe the late s and early s erin owns  of piskanja in addition to an exclusive exploration license covering  square kilometers of the basin in which the piskanja deposit is located  competitive advantages for the company include a large high quality ore deposit ready access to global markets existing regional infrastructure and excellent relationships with industry leadersin november  erin ventures filed a ni  technical report for piskanja that established an indicated mineral resource of  million tonnes of bo  million tonne ore at  and an inferred mineral resource of  million tonnes bo  million tonne at  which tim daniels believes is indicative of an economic deposit the property has kv electricity lines is accessible by paved road and rail from belgrade and the company estimates its operating costs could be as low as  per tonne erins technical report indicates a total of  million tons of pure bo in all categories however boron material is sold at  purity so if erin ventures has  million tons of  bo it means the company has  million tons of  bo sale grade  there is also a potential to expand the resource size as the deposit remains open in two directions as well there is the possibility of additional deposits in the remainder of the  km basin that belongs to erin the company expects as a result of further exploration in the recently announced feasibility work program that the deposit may grow substantially included in piskanja’s resource is a variety of borate minerals such as colemanite which is a key ingredient in glass production especially heat scratch and impact resistant glass such as fibreglass and borosilicate glass tv and device screens turkey is currently the only significant exporter of colemanite and thus it presents a potential opportunity for erin ventures as there seems to be an appetite amongst colemanite consumers for either an alternative or supplementary supplier this according to mr daniels       “we’re looking at a boron market penetration that equates to about  and there’s certainly a hole in the market for that sort of penetration or more from a good quality low cost producer” he said adding that the company has been in discussions for the past two or three years with several different potential strategic partners or companies willing to enter into off take agreements which includes some of the world’s largest borate buyers as part of its efforts to fund its feasibility study the next step on the way to a mine license and turn this project into an operating mine erin ventures on may   proposed subject to approval by canadian regulators a unique hybrid investment vehicle with a royalty and share component in order to raise up to  million mr daniels believes this is the most cost effective course of action for the company and its shareholders given what he considers to be the project’s high cash flow potential along with its high gross margins   for erin ventures’ investors
