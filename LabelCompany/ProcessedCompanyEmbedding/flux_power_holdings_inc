updated presentation to website   vista ca – may    flux power holdings inc otcqb flux a developer of advanced lithium batteries for industrial applications including electric forklifts and airport ground support equipment today announced financial results for its fiscal  third quarter q ‘ and posted an updated investor presentation on its website the presentation reviews flux’s product roadmap gotomarket strategy and its updated fiscal  sales outlook in lieu of a conference call flux will take and respond to investor questions in an online qa details below   highlights    ● q ‘  r evenue grew  in comparison to q ‘ to  principally due to increased customer shipments of flux’s lithiumion lift pack batteries for ‘walkie’ pallet jacks fork lifts enabled by the company’s ramping commercial production capabilities flux sold  more lift packs in q ‘ compared to q ‘ recognizing a greater increase in total revenue generated as a result of modest increases in their per pack sales price     ● q ‘  production resulted in an increase in finished class  lift packs included in inventory of  at march   compared to december   the expanded inventory is expected to enable larger order fulfillment an improved ability to respond to short timeframe replacement sales an expansion of piloting activity and greater ability to provide distributor inventories in other geographic regions flux continues to pursue ramping production and the related working capital requirements to fund it     ● airport ground support equipment gse flux recorded revenue from the shipment of one gse battery in q ‘ the much larger gse packs supply over  times the power of flux’s lift packs for ‘walkie’ pallet jacks and have an average price over six times as much four major airline carriers and two airport equipment manufacturers are currently piloting gse packs flux has sold three initial gse packs during fiscal year      ● class  forklift battery development  flux debuted is larger more powerful line of lift packs for larger class  forklifts at promat  in april flux is currently developing a class  lift pack with plans to begin piloting in june and to its solution later this year following active piloting and ul review   flux has encountered very strong interest from across the lift truck industry in a lithiumion power solution for class  vehicles this larger and more powerful solution – as compared to class  – provides a significant growth opportunity for flux given its much larger price and total market opportunity   financial results  q  ‘ revenues rose  to  compared to  in q ‘ mainly attributable to a significant increase in lift pack sales compared to q ‘ and approximately  of revenue in q ‘ from the sale of a gse battery pack to a customer at a major us airport   q  ‘ cost of sales rose at a slower rate than total revenue to  compared to  in q ‘ reflecting higher unit sales and initial benefits from flux’s gross margin improvement plan focused on reducing design sourcing and assembly costs flux’s lift pack line incorporates a range of design enhancements to improve the line’s ability to perform reliably in harsh environments the design improvements enabled further reductions in warranty expense in q ‘ for earliergeneration product returns and infield repairs required to ensure customer satisfaction flux believes it has a clear roadmap for design production and procurement initiatives to further improve product performance and margins over the next twelve months   selling and administrative expenses increased  to  in q ‘ from  in q ‘ q ‘ expenses included costs associated with the shipment of demo lift packs to distributors and customers to introduce our packs and increased payroll costs related to new personnel including a director of operations a new director of sales and the addition of a mechanical engineer and a senior tech specialist the hires are intended to support increased production and efficiency as well as to expand flux’s presence in the lift equipment marketplace   r esearch  development expenses declined  to  in q ‘ compared to  in q ‘ primarily due to decreased costs associated with flux’s initial ul certification project substantially completed in january  research and development expenses are expected to remain as a significant expense as flux invests in developing new products for the class   and  forklift markets as well as continuing to enhance features and functionality of the full product line    flux ’s q ‘ operating loss increased marginally to m from m in q ‘ despite significantly higher revenues largely due to the increased selling and administrative expense net loss in q ‘ decreased to m from m in q ‘ due to lower interest expenses on the line of credit   flux financing flux has funded its working capital through a combination of borrowings under a line of credit from its largest shareholder esenjay investments llc as well as through private placements of common stock more recently flux has received periodic advances that total  on a convertible note due october  issued by an existing shareholder in addition the outstanding balance on the line of credit from esenjay investments llc at the end of q ‘ is  and the maximum borrowing amount was increased in april  to    ceo comments ceo ron dutt commented “flux continues to ramp the pace of its lift pack sales and is confident in the potential to further accelerate our growth over the next few years our confidence stems from customer forklift dealer oem and battery distributor dialogues as they echo our views on the efficiency and total cost benefits of lithiumion forklift power customers are moving from the evaluation phase into the planning and budgeting required to deploy lithium for a sizable portion of their fleets we believe flux offers the premium lithiumion solution in the market based on the research piloting and approvals we have secured over nearly four years of effort we are also encouraged as the leading forklift oems are recognizing the role lithiumion can play in satisfying their customers and driving their businesses   “ while the pace of lithium’s displacement of leadacid batteries has been slower than we had hoped and remains difficult to predict we are seeing increasing interest in lithium solutions in the market as indicators of future revenue in fact with revenue of  for the first nine months of fiscal  flux has already well exceeded fullyear revenue of  last year with one quarter still to go though the enormous longterm growth potential of this market is clear it takes time for an industry to embrace new technology but we feel the time is now with steadily ramping customer interest and rising lift pack production we expect a substantially stronger sales performance in fiscal
