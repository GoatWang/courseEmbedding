minerals kicked its debt repayment further down the road  but is it far enoughjun  about hudbay minerals hbm the investment doctor longshort equity value debt base metalsmarketplaceeuropean smallcap ideassummaryhudbays management team made a good decision by increasing and extending the maturity of its debtthe adjusted free cash flow in q was still very low once you isolate the nonrecurring benefitsthe production cost at constancia will decrease sharply from next year onintroduction i haven’t been very impressed with the performance of hudbay minerals hbm in the past few years and when the copper price dropped to just  per pound the company’s chances to survive were very low as its balance sheet contained too much debt fortunately the copper price and the zinc price started to increase boosting hudbay’s cash flows hbm data by ycharts source ycharts the higher copper price in q provides more room to breathe hudbay’s two production hubs are in peru copperfocused and manitoba zincfocused and on a consolidated basis hudbay sold a total of  tonnes of copper just over  ounces of gold almost  ounces of silver and almost  tonnes of zinc in the first quarter of this year as you can see on the next image the copper and gold price were definitely cooperating during the quarter source stockchartscom whilst the gold price was higher compared to the end of  it was slightly lower compared to the first quarter of last year but fortunately the higher copper and zinc prices made up for the difference source quarterly report the company’s total revenue in the first quarter remained stable at usm the higher copper price compensated for the lower copper production volumes resulting in a gross profit of just over m which is almost twice as high as the gross profit in q  that’s a good result but we shouldn’t forget the majority of this improvement is related to a lower depreciation charge on the assets the operating income also increased to m thanks to a onetime benefit related to an insurance claim on the constancia copper mine where the company received compensation for an incident during the commissioning phase of the plant despite this benefit hudbay still reported a net loss of m as its finance expenses remain very high the m net debt reduction was caused by onetime benefits as you know you can’t repay debt with a paper profit and the ‘real’ cash flows are what really matter for hudbay minerals hudbay was proud to announce it generated m in free cash flow which reduced its net debt but unfortunately the adjusted free cash flows are much weaker than what you’d expect so let’s start with analyzing the operating cash flows according to hudbay the total operating cash flow was m okay but almost m was caused by working capital changes and this is per definition nonrecurring secondly it looks like the operating cash flow also included the insurance payment which also is a nonrecurring item this already reduces the adjusted operating cash flow to m source financial statements that would still be a strong result but there’s one important final part of the puzzle the interest expenses based on the new situation  on a b bond and  on a m loan the average quarterly interest expenses will be approximately m with q and q being the interestheavy quarters after taking this into consideration the fully adjusted operating cash flow in q was just m still sufficient to cover the m in capital expenditures but with an adjusted free cash flow of just m in q the company’s net debt of in excess of b remains relatively high is the situation hopeless no but hudbay will have to be careful – and buying time was an excellent move a first important improvement of its financial situation will be the lalor expansion the new plant will process ore at a capacity of  tonnes per day which is  higher than the current milling rate of  tonnes per day according to the company’s ceo in the conference call this will improve the efficiencies and reduce the sustaining capex which is positive on both fronts another positive note is hudbay’s progress at rosemont it took the company much longer than expected but the rosemont copper project in arizona is now finally moving ahead however rosemont won’t be the holy grail the internal rate of return at  copper is just over  and i doubt financiers will be falling over themselves to fund the construction of the project never say never though as i heard chinese smelters and endusers have been kicking the tires of some north american projects in an attempt to secure a stable supply however i wouldn’t count on rosemont in the near future a third positive achievement will be the inclusion of the higher grade pampacancha zone in the constancia mine plan hudbay confirmed in its conference call  will be the‘peak year for cash cost and the sustaining cash cost before significantly declining in  to ’ this means the adjusted operating and free cash flow should increase accelerating the net debt reduction source company presentation the company’s new management did one thing which will very likely have saved the company’s shareholders from additional dilution in december  when the copper price was increasing it refinanced the existing  debt with two new bonds raising b with an average cost of debt of  this reduced the annual interest expenses by m per year and kicked the can three years further down the road instead of having to repay m in  it now has to repay m in  and m in  a golden move as the company borrowed more cash at a  lower cost and that’s a job well done investment thesis hudbay’s turnaround has started and the company’s free cash flow in q will help to reduce the net debt although marginal m the free cash flow is expected to increase in the next few years as the sustaining capex will decrease whilst a new zone with higher returns will be mined at constancia resulting in a substantially lower allin sustaining cost per produced pound of copper disclosure

by hank stephenson click to enlarge courtesy photo pima county administrator chuck huckelberry the pima county board of supervisors put state environmental regulators and hudbay minerals on notice that they will be watching as the state at the mining companys request reviews the protected status of nearly two dozen important arizona waters by a  vote the board on july  approved a resolution stating the county will oppose any effort to delist the waters as outstanding arizona waters a designation that has been given to  rare and ecologically significant waterways and which offers the areas the highest level of protection available under the law   the status of one such outstanding water is of particular concern to both the mining company and the tucson area davidson canyon is a desert stream within the santa cruz watershed southeast of tucson that supports a host of rare plants and animals the protected stream has been a thorn in the side of hudbay the company behind rosemont mine the army corps of engineers has denied the company permits needed to open rosemont based in part on the possibility that the mine will degrade the water quality at davidson canyon pima county administrator chuck huckelberry described the resolution as a message that the county is going to pay very close attention during the states upcoming review of water regulations and will push back against any attempt by hudbay to try to water down protections for davidson canyon and other arizona outstanding waters county officials say the review which will be conducted amid a larger triennial review of broader water regulations could endanger not just davidson canyon which supplies roughly  percent of tucsons water but all  of arizonas outstanding waters but pima county supervisor steve christy who voted against the resolution accused huckleberry and the boards majority of stoking antihudbay sentiments it was merely an attempt by mr huckleberry to prevent hudbay from seeking any clarification on the outstanding waters regulations he said of the resolution huckelberry said his concerns are threefold first the next triennial review isnt due until  and the department is starting the process early and with little notice more importantly he said its fishy that he only learned from a public records request that hudbay had emailed the department of environmental quality requesting that a full review of all of arizonas outstanding waters be included in the triennial review and that the state had ceded to that request were very concerned that hudbay the mining company has requested this action its a pretty unusual move we havent seen that before he said   arizona department of environmental quality spokesperson caroline oppleman said the triennial review is not starting early and that just like any other stakeholder hudbay has a right to request a review of arizonas outstanding waters designations but huckelberry said his biggest concern is that hudbays request is clearly a selfserving attempt to weaken protections on a body of water that has stood in the way of opening the rosemont mine in an email to arizona department of environmental quality protesting the decision to review the status of the  protected waters two of which are in pima county huckelberry said state officials should recognize hudbays thinlyveiled request for what it really is a selfserving gesture to facilitate pollution of arizona surface waters kathy arnold director of environment for hudbay said in an email that the company asked for the review because it is concerned that its own tests along with tests from the department of environmental quality show exceedances of metals in the background in stormwater samples  that extend into davidson canyon she said the company is concerned that they would be held responsible for degradation to davidson canyon caused by the polluted stormwater because outstanding waters must have high water quality we requested that adeq determine how they would treat the stormwater component  the only way to do that is to evaluate the listing and the underlying water quality she wrote christy who along with fellow republican supervisor ally miller voted against the resolution said hudbay has every right to petition regulators to review the status of protected waters that are a hurdle to the mine but he doesnt think thats why the company requested the review   i read it as a preemptive measure by hudbay to protect their flanks—to see what the preexisting contaminants might or might not be in the davidson canyon creek he said i dont read into it any nefarious dealing behind the scenes with adeq by hudbay to try to get any kind of advantage more currents feature » tags currents feature tweet   sort

hudbay minerals is a canadian mining company focused on the discovery production and marketing of base and precious metals with the economy in the dump and gold and other minerals at record levels i wish i were them  also this is our first multinational mineral company office submission in their new leed silver headquarters hudbay minerals decided to integrate some of their trade into the office by mounting pure zinc ingots stamped with the company logo on the wall adjacent the elevator as with many of the design companies we’ve seen showing clients and potential customers something your company has produced can be a wonderful asset in the office the design was inspired by images from the company’s extensive photo library ranging from the mining of the raw materials to the smelting processes and the finished products over the years these processes have been carefully documented producing an archive of stunning photographs that evoke the work of ed burtynsky and jesse bolles the ceiling is composed of panels of recycled spun aluminum whose open cells allow light from above to filter through this also evokes the netting that wraps the ceilings of the mines stepping into the reception area a dramatic view of the skyline of toronto is framed on one side by three freestanding stone walls that define a large meeting room and on the other by a commissioned installation by toronto artist dennis lin the walls are comprised of rough split face stone inspired by a hudbay photo of vertical cliffs that have been hewn from the rock while the art piece of copper and walnut evokes both the strata of the earth and the sinuous line of copper as it is poured into moulds in the company’s foundries suspended above the seating area a custom sized “mercury” light fixture from artemide by ross lovegrove evokes droplets of molten metal a rich burned orange colour is used for both fabrics and back painted glass at coffee stations this was inspired by the colour of molten copper in place of a more traditional corporate art programme taylor smyth collaborated with darren alexander an art curator to select actual photos from the hudbay archives which have been blown up and line the walls of the building’s core the concrete structure of the base building has been left exposed broken up by expanses of acoustic wood ceiling offices and workstations are fabricated of
