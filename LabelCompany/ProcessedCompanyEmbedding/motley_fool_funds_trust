fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search what is a trust fund trust funds offer several advantages and best of all you dont need to be rich to set one up when we think of trust funds we often imagine wealthy families setting up their children for life but in reality nonwealthy families can also benefit from trust funds a trust fund is a fund that consists of assets intended to benefit an individual or organization a trust fund might be comprised of assets such as stocks bonds cash or property in the case of an individual beneficiary the recipient of the trust must often wait to reach a certain age or until a certain event occurs to receive income from the fund until then a trustee is tasked with managing the fund as per the specifications of the person who set up the trust image source getty images parties in a trust fund there are three important players in a trust fund the first the grantor is the individual who establishes the trust in the first place this grantor is the person who contributes assets to the fund and who decides how the fund should be managed then theres the beneficiary the person who gets to benefit financially from the trust a trust fund beneficiary is often the child or grandchild of a wealthy grantor but it can also be a charity or organization finally theres the trustee who can be a single person or a group of people tasked with overseeing the trust fund and ensuring that its managed as per the instructions of the grantor trustees are often paid a fee in exchange for their services and some are given more power than others in managing trusts some for example are given the authority to select investments for the funds they manage while others are simply responsible for distributing payments as per the grantors request benefits of trust funds setting up a trust fund is a great way to ensure that your beneficiaries are taken care of financially especially after your passing while a will serves a similar function a trust fund offers an added layer of protection if you fall ill or become mentally or physically incapable of managing your own finances and affairs furthermore there are certain tax advantages to be gained by setting up a trust fund trust funds can be established in a manner that helps minimize estate taxes thus ensuring that more money goes to your beneficiaries revocable trusts a revocable or living trust is a type of trust in which a grantor places assets during his or her lifetime those assets are then transferred to the funds beneficiaries after the grantors death the benefit of revocable trusts is that the grantor has the ability to make changes to the way theyre set up another major advantage of revocable trusts is that unlike wills the assets in question arent subject to probate an oftenlengthy legal process following a persons death rather the assets are typically distributed quickly to the beneficiaries designated in the trust charitable remainder trusts a charitable remainder trust is a type of trust in which a grantor designates assets to be donated to a specified charity the charity serves as the trustee of the trust and manages its assets as those assets produce income the charity pays the grantor or another named beneficiary a portion of that income for a certain period of time as established in the trust once that period ends which may or may not coincide with the death of the grantor the assets go to that charity with a charitable remainder trust the grantor gets an immediate tax benefit and once the trusts assets are completely transferred to the assigned charity theyre no longer subject to federal estate taxes though there are several benefits to setting up a trust the process can also be complicated most individuals therefore require the help of an attorney in establishing trust funds for their beneficiaries  this article is part of the motley fools knowledge center which was created based on the collected wisdom

pm est as we noted yesterday the financial web site the motley fool dispenses some good advice but fails to back that up when creating their own mutual funds theyre demonstrating that like most of wall street and the financial media their interests come before yours about a decade ago the web site used to maintain real money model portfolios this was pretty distinguishing at the time as this meant their strategies were in the publics full view unlike some money managers and newsletter publishers who require a just trust me approach the motley fool was subject to open scorn for underperforming at the end of february  the brothers announced that they were discontinuing publication of their real money model portfolios why would the motley fool choose to get rid of their portfolios according to their web site the motley fool concluded that the realmoney aspect of their portfolios had gotten in the way of their educational function given the track record of their portfolios a cynic would suggest another answer being skeptical of all claims of ability to beat the market we went to our trusty videotape to check the performance record of the foolish strategies according to the calculations of the hulbert financial digest the motley fools portfolios produced a  percent annualized return over the sixyear period that hulbert tracked their performance over the same period the wilshire  a broad market index produced an annualized return of  percent this is a comparable result to the findings of numerous studies on actively managed mutual funds  they underperform by approximately  percent per year on a pretax basis its also important to note that hulberts data includes several portfolios that the fool used to maintain but were discontinued along the way thus theres none of the usual survivorship bias in the data obviously the fools had been fooled into believing that they had found strategies that were likely to produce above market returns one last note of interest the man responsible for running these portfolios was william mann who currently runs the motley fool funds we examined yesterday on the surface it appears that the fools have failed to learn from their past mistakes engaging in insane behavior theres also another explanation for such foolish behavior the fools know that their funds arent likely to outperform but theyre likely to generate profits for them because of the high expense ratios of the funds the very type fees they have been lambasting for years  to clarify william mann served as the senior analyst for the motley fool during some of the period hulbert examined not for the entire period apologies for the error more on moneywatch a motley fool and his money are soon parted why scary announcements are

fool while doing some research on mutual funds i found their educational content to be a great overview of what to look for and started exploring while the motley fool has a lot of great content im not entirely comfortable with their incessant upselling they always so eager to tell me about some insiders stock of the day that they are sure is just about to explode tomorrow if only i will give them some of my valuable personal information is this a scam are they just using their legacy educational content to bait people into their premium services are their premium services even any good the motley fool once had a fair amount of internet street cred are the motley fools stock picks and services worth giving any mind share to or are they just another jim cramer loudly shouting ticker symbols to sell advertisements websites stockanalysis shareimprove this question asked feb   at  ryan michela     realise that if they have so much geniune insider information how come they still do research and publish rather than becoming an investment firm getting insider information isnt that easy – dumbcoder feb   at     actually they are doing mutual funds now – fennec feb   at     those who know dont tell those who tell dont know – greg feb   at       years ago i started a trial subscription to one of their newsletters and then cancelled during the following months they advertised the subscription to me for lesser and lesser fees until i finally bought a subscription at the reduced price for educational purposes even though i had no money at all to invest at the time – rice flour cookies feb   at       can you buy stock in the motley fool usually the people that sell the tools make the most money vs the people out there that are digging holes looking for gold with the tools – user mar   at     show  more comments  answers  active oldest votes up vote  down vote accepted the motley fool is generally regarded as relatively legit at least in that theyre not likely to do anything outright fraudulent and they definitely have reasonably indepth content to provide you the motley fool makes a fair amount of money off the subscriptions though and they do hawk them quite violently if i didnt have a generally good opinion of them to begin with id have been completely put off as well its pretty shameful i dont think its worth hundreds of dollars a year but then again i dont look at investing as a second career like the fool likes to suggest either shareimprove this answer answered feb   at  fennec k    i agree with fennec on this i visit motley fool regularly and like their analysis of things it tends to be reasonable and hype free though there are exceptions there are far fewer than other places i have not bought any of their paid content and unless you have a bunch of money riding on it it may not be cost effective you may not get the money you paid back in increased investment returns – chrisfs feb   at       chrisfs it says it only costs  per year

their recommendations pretend to buy the stocks they say how do they do do they ever say to sell the stocks after their buy recommendations there are lots and lots of opinions out there i doubt people really hear about the good ones because a the good ones have paid newsletters andor b the good ones arent telling a soul because theyre absolutely cleaning it up warren buffett doesnt announce his

mind only a fool follow other fool and market is full of both i guess my answer will be highly down voted p shareimprove this answer answered dec   at  h  add a comment   up vote  down vote ive had a mf stock advisor for  or  years now and ive belong to supernova for a couple of years i also have money in one of their mutual funds the fool has a lot of very good educational information available especially for people who are new to investing many people do not understand that wall street is in the business of making money for wall street not making money for investors i have stayed with the fool because their philosophy aligns with my personal investment philosophy i look at the stock advisor picks sometimes i buy them sometimes i dont but the analysis is very good they also have been good at tracking their picks over time and writing updates when specific stocks drop a certain amount with their help ive assembled a portfolio that i dont have to spend too much time managing and have done pretty well from a return perspective stock advisor also has a good set of forums where you can interact with other investors in summary the view from the inside has been pretty good from the outside i think their marketing is a reflection of the fact that most people arent very interested in a rational  conservative approach to investing in the stock market so mf chooses to go for an approach that gets more traffic im not particularly excited about it but im sure theyve done ab testing and have figured out what way works the best i think that they have had moneyback guarantees on some of their programs in the past so you could try them out risk free not sure if those are still around shareimprove this answer answered mar   at  eric gunnerson       they offer a complete refund if youre not happy after one month – odp may   at  add a comment   up vote  down vote not sure how i came across the motley fool blog in the first instance but found the writing style refreshing  then along came some free advice on asx share prospects then the next day and email expounding the benefits i would get by joining up for two years at  off if i hit the button now getting in at ground floor on the next technology stock rocket  i replied what a hard sell  why wouldnt i apply the age old adage of  if it sounds too good to be true it probably is their reply was thanks for your note the honest answer is that despite people knowing they should do something to help themselves prepare for their financial futures few actually do it we find these messages actually work in getting people to hit yes much better than an understated email that just says here are our results and our philosophy  let us know if youre interested unfortunately yours foolishly so i have put some of these recommendations onto a watch list time will tell shareimprove this answer answered nov   at  user  add a comment   up vote  down vote i would personally beware of the motley fool their success is based largely on their original investment strategy book it had a lot of good advice in it but it pushed a strategy called the foolish four which was an investing strategy since it was based on a buyandhold method with month evaluation intervals it was not a getrichquick scheme however its methods were validated through data mining and subsequently turned out to be not so good at least they admit this httpwwwfoolcomddowddowhtm shareimprove this answer answered mar   at  almo  add a comment   protected by mrchrister mar   at  thank you for your interest in this question because it has
