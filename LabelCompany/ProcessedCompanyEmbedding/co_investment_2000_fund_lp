financial sponsor or other private equity investor in a leveraged buyout recapitalization or growth capital transaction in certain circumstances venture capital firms may also seek coinvestors diagram of the structure of an equity coinvestment in a portfolio company alongside a financial sponsor private equity firms seek coinvestors for several reasons most important of these is that coinvestments allow a manager to make larger investments without either dedicating too much of the funds capital to a single transaction ie exposure issues or sharing the deal with competing private equity firms coinvestors bring a friendly source of capital typically coinvestors are existing limited partners in an investment fund managed by the lead financial sponsor in a transaction unlike the investment fund however coinvestments are made outside of the existing fund and as such coinvestors rarely pay management fees or carried interest on an individual investment coinvestments are typically passive noncontrolling investments as the private equity firm or firms involved will exercise control and perform monitoring functions for large private equity fund of funds and other investors coinvestments are a means of increasing exposure to attractive transactions and making investments that have a higher return potential because of the lower economics paid to the general partner as a result many private equity firms offer coinvestments to their largest and most important investors as an incentive to invest in future funds see alsoedit private equity fund of funds financial sponsor

as a result of their placement of a deal with a private equity sponsor peco is a family office fund that purchases coinvestment opportunities on a casebycase basis across a wide range of industries and deal sizes our proprietary investment management teams based on deal size and industry sector help make investment decisions on our behalf usually peco sources investment opportunities arising as a matter of a contractual right held by an ma intermediary sometimes however a private equity gp or lp will bring coinvestments to peco because they are constrained by investment restrictions around a particular deal size and thus need to bring in additional “outside coinvestors” the basis for creating peco lies in the fact that in most cases ma intermediaries do not have sufficient cash to fund their coinvestment rights at the deal closing these coinvestment rights typically range from  of the equity of the deals they source currently over  ma firms source and bring coinvestment opportunities to peco the coinvestment deals brought to peco have already been vetted and approved through due diligence for investment by leading private equity sponsors over the past five years peco has built an extensive network of participating ma intermediaries peco becomes informed of “prescreened” “vetted” and “investment committee approved” private equity sponsored coinvestments these deals are funded by leading private equity firms and cover a wide range of business sectors peco has a unique opportunity to evaluate deals not otherwise available atlarge peco’s deals typically range from  million to  million in enterprise value most coinvestment opportunities are in the  million to  million range per transaction however over the past several years about one third of the coinvestment opportunities have been between  million to  million deal volume increased as more and more ma intermediaries began participating peco provides carried interest compensation to the ma firms that bring individual deals ma intermediaries keep all cash transaction fees paid by the private equity sponsors supporting each transaction private equity fund  wikipedia private equity fund from wikipedia the
