the united states secret service he spent many years combating counterfeiting which led to his investigation and arrests of black hand extortionists and members of the american mafia many of them associated with the morello crime family flynn collaborated with new york police department detective giuseppe joe petrosino who was murdered in  in palermo sicily where he was tracing the backgrounds of the gangsters plaguing new york city petrosinos murder was never officially solved but authorhistorian mike dash implicates the likely triggerman and his accomplice and says there is little doubt that giuseppe morello was behind it flynn and his operatives built the case that culminated in the  convictions of morello and his associates and their imprisonment at atlanta federal prison flynn gained recognition in  when he successfully reorganized the new york city detective force he later returned to the secret service as chief – during world war i he served as chief of the united states railroad administrations secret service investigating threats of sabotage william flynn  fbi careeredit in  flynn was named director of the bureau of investigation attorney general palmer praised his new appointee as the leading organizing detective of americaflynn is an anarchist chaserthe greatest anarchist expert in the united states in one of flynns highprofile incidents one of his operatives who was trailing german diplomat dr heinrich albert on a streetcar snatched alberts briefcase which contained sensitive documents the papers documented alberts having spent  million to build up a spy network in the united states using german money to fund dock strikes attacks on shipping and bombs planted in munitions plants resignationedit on september   flynn resigned saying he had a private business matter to accept attorney general harry daugherty accepted the resignation immediately and appointed william j burns to the positioncitation needed soon thereafter the true reason for flynns resignation emerged flynns hardline approach to counterespionage and his scaremongering public statements meant to rouse the usa to the threat of german espionage angered the german and irish communities and eroded flynns support in washington after resigning flynn accepted a sinecure as head of the federal railway administration police reinstatement and replacementedit two years after leaving the secret service in the wake of concerted terrorist action including a bomb that shook the home of a mitchell palmer the attorney general of the united states virtually demolishing it palmer dedicated his department of justice to tracking down the men responsible he appointed flynn director of the bureau of investigation flynn took charge of hunting down the bombers and assigned an ambitious justice department clerk by the name of j edgar hoover to monitor suspected radicals through painstaking work flynns team identified the likely suspects however they were unable to obtain the type of evidence that would stand up in court public opinion turned against the bureau as the public wanted arrests and hoover launched a series of palmer raids that became a public relations nightmare these events resulted in low morale among flynns staff and the new harding administration replaced flynn with william j burns semiretirementedit after his forced retirement flynn went into business for himself he founded a new york detective agency with his daughter veronica and son elmer as partners which generated some income however reports authorhistorian mike dash the partnership was unsuccessful and contributed to the businesss ultimate demise veronica and elmer were running the detective business into the ground both heavy drinkers they overspent and upset clients the pairs increasingly erratic behavior distressed their more abstemious father and the worry weakened him flynn earned the bulk of his income at that point from writing he had occasionally contributed articles typically about his greatest cases to such journals as the new york herald and the washington post since  after retiring he worked briefly as a crime novelist flynn also became a scenario writer for the motion picture industry through his acquaintance with the actor king baggot who dash notes was considered the greatest film star in the country at that time in  producers theodore and leopold
