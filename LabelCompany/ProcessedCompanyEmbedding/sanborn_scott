cunningham on may   in news  community tweet email print dont miss new articles follow lendingmemo wednesday after my interview with prosper i barely had five minutes of rest before i arrived at lending club’s headquarters arriving at pm i was invited by their receptionist to take a seat and wait for scott sanborn lending club’s chief operating officer behind her stood the red squared lending club logo cut and illuminated next to me on the wall was mounted the infographic they produced when they crossed  billion in issued loans see here the whole thing felt a bit surreal it is somewhat difficult to recreate here how thrilled i was for this meeting i am one of these people that lending club’s renaud laplanche describes as having “lending club fever” i love this company maybe it’s because my first lending account was with them more likely i simply have had a great experience with them over the years whatever the case i must have looked pretty funny sitting on the edge of that couch sipping water at twenty second intervals so as to look the part i should have been more chill when scott sanborn came and brought me into a conference room his demeanor was overwhelmingly relaxed he closed the door and sat down across the table from me after exchanging introductions i asked sanborn “can we talk about this google investment a bit” wsj article “sure” scott replied “renaud is better able to talk about this than i am but i can certainly cover the basics” “great” i said “so tell me what does this mean” scott thought for a moment “i’m not able to talk to google’s motivation for making the sale” he said with an easy tone “what we’re excited about is that there is a lot that google does well if you look at their tenets they are very similar to lending club it’s a data driven business that is committed to doing the right thing they created a lot of efficiencies in online advertising we’re creating efficiencies in banking we have opportunities to learn from them and work with them in the future” “so you see collaboration happening” i responded with interest “a union of google and lend…” “i’m not sure about a union of google and lending club” scott said with a hint of kind sarcasm downplaying my dramatic line of thinking and provoking laughter from me “right now it is an investment but it does open the door for opportunities for us” “what are some of the risks or drawbacks from this” i asked beginning to get a feel for scott’s dry humor “i don’t see any drawbacks” he said “this has been…” “…nothing but good news” i offered “nothing but good news” scott agreed we continued talking speaking about the possible ipo that would allow every state in the us to be open to investors the socalled ‘blue sky exemption’ scott spoke about how hard lending club is working to get more and more people lending “over time there will be other ways to broaden investor participation” he explained “we currently have the retail platform that for the extremely involved and selfdirected investor is a way to totally control your investment at the detailed level but i think over time there is nothing to stop us from having a public fund that people could buy into in regard to a public offering we do plan to be ready next year but going public depends on the market window that said our financials are already public we report quarterly all our numbers are already out there so we’ve got a lot of the burden without receiving a lot of the benefit” “renaud laplanche was talking to bloomberg” i said source “he said ‘we are trying to reshape the way people think about credit’ what is the way people think about credit wrongly” scott thought carefully “the big insight for us is this if you ask people whether or not they need a loan they generally say ‘no’ the idea of needing a loan doesn’t feel great but when you ask people if they paid off their credit card in full last month they also tend to say ‘no’ because almost half of all americans have outstanding credit card debt so the answer is ‘you already have a loan and it is likely at an interest rate that is higher than you need to pay’” “a credit card is a great utility vehicle it’s in your wallet you can pay for anything use it anytime as a debt instrument it’s not that great” sanborn said emphasizing this point “we think we have something better it’s fixed rate and fully amortizing at lower cost” “so imagine i’m the average american” i replied “how am i thinking of credit wrongly” scott said “i wouldn’t say you’re thinking about it wrongly you’re probably not thinking about it right if you ask a lot of americans they often don’t know what the interest rate is on their credit cards they didn’t get a credit card based on an interest rate they got it based on flier miles on gas points or on a shopping discount and those cards often times have interest rates of  they are not aware of interest rates until they can’t pay it off it’s more just about being conscious if you’re using the card and you’re not paying it off you need to make yourself aware of the interest rate you’re paying and find out if there’s a smarter way of approaching that” scott further explained this point “if you have equity in your home then that’s a great way to pay for lots of things one thing you should think of right away is to tap that first rather than the credit card and if you don’t have that credit available look for a personal loan from lending club” “interesting” i said thinking about the gap that exists between lowinterest mortgages and highinterest credit cards “let’s look at another really interesting quote from renaud the new york times dealbook spoke with him and to them he said ‘the reason we like google is that they are the good guys of tech and we’re trying to be the good guys of finance’” i asked scott “what does it mean to be the good guys of finance” “you’ve talked about some of it already right transparency” scott said plainly “essentially delivering a fair responsible product with transparency as to what you are getting that is to me what it means to be the good guy we like to make credit available to people who can afford to have it at a rate that is representative of their risk a lot of banks won’t make personal loans and if they do and you qualify your rate is the same to this i say ‘well wait a minute that means if i have an  fico credit score i’m paying the same rate as someone who has a  fico’” “it’s the same with credit cards” i said “people’s fico scores not involved” “correct “scott agreed eagerly “we are able to give prime credit consumers the credit they deserve to me that’s what means to be the good guy” i really liked that last sentence wanting to hear more about who exactly lending club was on the path to disrupting i asked “what is the side of finance that this approach corrects referencing these existing nontransparent lessefficient models how are you different from the traditional financial system” thinking this out scott said “there are a lot of things we’re doing different from the traditional financial system one is we were built from the ground up to be technology enabled he tapped the table with each of these two words the borrower application is dynamic and progressive as you’re telling us things the application changes based on what we are learning about you the process of underwriting is highly automated we’re doing as much as we can through thirdparty data systems and models as opposed to individual humans checking boxes the process is more efficient the structure is more efficient we don’t have the branch system we’re trying to pay for we don’t have the same capital reserve requirements this is not fdic guaranteed like a savings account at a traditional bank which means we don’t need to reserve capital against your investment while we’re subject to all the same fair lending regulations and truth in advertising we’re not subject to the same capital reserve burdens and regulatory hurdles” “do you think the nation is going to move away from the volatility of the stock market” i asked “um boy that’s too big a sweeping statement for me” scott said “i’ll tell you what we’re observing people are very hungry for stability and stable yield i think a lot of people are thinking differently now this has been a lost decade for investors people are thinking different about portfolio planning and how to round out their investment portfolios i think that equities will continue to play a vital role in people’s overall investment mix but alternatives are certainly getting a lot more interest people are thinking more broadly this is why we’re getting such demand right now” i switched topics “talk to me a little bit about the relationship you have with prosper from my conversations with various people it’s almost like prosper wants a place at the table and you guys are kind of hesitant to allow that” “place at what table” scott asked “in the conversation that is happening about peer to peer lending in general” i said scott paused “prosper is under new management now” he said “and i’m excited to see what they do in the past there have been some pretty big mistakes that we often got swept up in i think it is a fair statement to say there is a level of enterprise risk that is different between the two companies we respect their business and are interested to see what happens with the new management and we want it all to work out great because it is to our benefit to have investors doing well but i think we’re trying to be cautious about being lumped together” “we’re profitable at this point we have  million in cash in the bank i guess it isn’t that they are not a player in the market but we’re doing  times their volume so when people say ‘there are two major players in the market and here’s how they stack up’ we want to say ‘yes there are more than two players there are several but there are very significant differences we are making lower interest rate loans to a higher credit quality population with a lower default rate it’s a different risk profile on the investment” we finished by talking about where lending club was going in the coming year about the mobile site they are working on and their upcoming automated investment tool i asked him if i could see their people at work and scott led me around to two different floors each filled with working employees as we walked down the stairs scott pointed my attention sideways at first i thought he was just admiring the lit glass panels surrounding the stairway but he actually was pointing through them anybody who walks down the stairs at lending club is met by a row of bright displays screens which give constantly updating statistics of lending club’s progress i saw scott exude a deepseated pride towards these stats and it was easy to see why there in cascading barcharts was lending club’s ever growing base of investors and borrowers of new ira accounts and largevalue deposits to me it looked something like a revolution a kaleidoscope of momentum the epitaph of wall street honestly when i had first walked in to lending club that day i was hoping renaud laplanche lending club’s ceo would be available i was originally let down when only scott was available let down because i assumed he would be less at liberty to speak his mind less involved with lending club’s journey i could not have been more wrong over the time we met sanborn revealed himself to be not just deeply knowledgeable about his company but unmistakably passionate about its success and mission when scott said goodbye ushering me away from lending club’s offices to the elevator i was awash with amazement over what i had seen something big is happening here google’s recent investment is really not the news bloomberg and dealbook should be focusing on it is really just an arrow pointing towards something else lending club itself questions or comments if you enjoyed this

they offer a novel midrange interest rate on personal loans but that is a far cry from ending the existence of savings accounts home mortgages and revolving credit lines it is interesting i suppose watching this techenabled company find that untapped market but how does that make wall street at risk in any way at all reply simon cunningham says may   at  pm hi greg thanks for your response the reason we talk about lending club doing away with the banking system and wall street are for a couple reasons without going into too much detail the loans are better more people are approved at lower interest rates it’s hard for people with decent credit to even get a personal loan these days second the investing side is better lower volatility than the stock market higher returns greater liquidity if pp lending catches on you’re going to have far less independent investors on the stock market and far fewer people applying to their banks for loans reply martin says june   at  pm wow excellent post simon i enjoyed it what i am interested in a lot is that retail platform can a little dude as me participate on it or is it only for a big investors or what do they refer to as “retail platform” is the regular platform we see when log in to our accounts the next thing i am interested in is the potential ipo i will definitely be buying some post ipo shares because i really believe in this business model and i think it has a bright future ahead reply leave a question or comment cancel reply name email not published your website comment notify me of followup comments via email our
