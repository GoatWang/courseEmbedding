treatment of severe genetic rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis leber’s congenital amaurosis type  and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa based on our unique proprietary rna repair platform technologies we are growing our pipeline with patients and loved ones in mind since about cystic fibrosis cf is the most common fatal inherited disease in the western world and affects an estimated  patients worldwide in people with cf a defective cftr gene causes a thick buildup of mucus in the lungs pancreas and other organs in the lungs the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections extensive lung damage and eventually respiratory failure there is no cure for cf disease manifestations lead to a shortened life expectancy with a median age of death of  years or less although over  cfcausing gene mutations have been identified approximately  of all cf patients are affected by the fdel mutation among all cf patients approximately  are homozygous for the fdel mutationabout leber’s congenital amaurosis type  leber’s congenital amaurosis is the most common genetic cause of blindness in children and consists of a group of diseases of which lca type  lca  is one of the more severe forms lca  leads to progressive loss of vision causing most patients to lose their sight in the first few years of life to date there are no treatments approved or product candidates in clinical development that treat the underlying cause of this specific subtype of the disease lca  is caused by mutations in the cep gene of which the pcysx mutation is most common although prevalence rates vary we believe approximately  people in the western world have lca  because of this mutationabout dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa deb is a rare genetic disorder of the skin and mucosal membranes and is characterized by fragile skin severe blistering and poorly healing wounds that result from minimal pressure some forms of deb are painful and debilitating and are associated with very low quality of life and a limited life expectancy the disease is caused by mutations in the cola gene that lead to a weak connection between the dermis
