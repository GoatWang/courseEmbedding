the net proceeds from the sale of the adss and warrants in this offering will be us million or up to us million if the underwriter exercises its option to purchase additional adss andor warrants in full based on an initial public offering price of us per ads which is the price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows • approximately us million for development of hepbarna for hepatitis b for preclinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept and through to submission of an ind application • approximately us million for preclinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept of the amd program and through to submission of an ind application and initiation of a clinical trial • approximately us million for development of the opmd program for preclinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept and through to submission of an ind application and • the remainder for the discovery development and acquisition of complementary targets and technologies and for working capital and general corporate purposes we believe that the proceeds from this offering together with our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to advance our product candidate for hepatitis c through phase iiia clinical trials to advance our product candidates for hepatitis b and opmd through completion of preclinical proof of concept trials and to submission of ind applications and to advance our product candidate for amd through completion of preclinical trials submission of an ind application and initiation of a clinical trial advancing our product candidate for nsclc through completion of preclinical trials and advancing our product candidates for hepatitis b and opmd into clinical trials would require additional financing apart from this offering as of june   our cash and cash equivalents were a million as of the date of this prospectus we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations depending upon numerous factors including the progress of our research and development efforts the progress of our clinical trials our operating costs accordingly we retain the discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering and we reserve the right to change the allocation of the net proceeds described above pending these uses we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in investment grade interestbearing instruments securities or certificates of deposit the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future while we believe that our proprietary technology estate and scientific expertise in gene silencing using ddrnai provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including larger and betterfunded pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies we are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapy or gene silencing product candidates including • alnylam tekmira and arrowhead—developing sirnabased therapeutics for hepatitis b • avalanche biotechnologies inc applied genetic technologies corporation and oxford biomedica—developing gene therapies for wet amd we are not aware of any companies developing a gene therapy or gene silencing approach for hcv nsclc or opmd there are other therapies either being marketed or currently in development for all of these diseases some of which already have significant market share our product candidates if approved would also compete with treatments that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community patients and thirdparty payors for example with respect to hepatitis c our product candidate would compete with small molecule treatments such as sovaldi and harvoni each of which was developed by gilead sciences inc and viekira pak a regimen consisting of four medications developed by abbvie inc many of our competitors and potential competitors alone or with their strategic partners have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available we expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of among other things efficacy safety convenience of administration and delivery price the level of competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market in addition we expect that our therapeutic products if approved will be priced at a significant premium over competitive products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other thirdparty payors seeking to encourage the use of competitive products including biosimilar or generic products company description we are a clinicalstage biotechnology company developing a novel proprietary therapeutic technology platform that combines gene silencing and gene therapy with a goal of providing sustained long lasting silencing of diseasecausing genes from a single administration we believe our technology has the potential to be a “one shot” cure for a wide range of diseases that are currently addressed by strict ongoing treatment regimens or that have no effective treatment or only palliative care options we are using our technology called dnadirected rna interference or ddrnai to develop our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of numerous chronic and lifethreatening human diseases such as hepatitis c hepatitis b agerelated macular degeneration or amd drugresistant nonsmall cell lung cancer or nsclc and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy or opmd we will require additional financing apart from this offering to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates for hepatitis b amd and opmd and to conclude preclinical trials for our product candidate for nsclc these diseases have large patient populations with the exception of opmd which is a rare disease in addition we have licensed our ddrnai technology to other biopharmaceutical companies whose pipeline programs are progressing towards or are in clinical development for applications including hivaids retinitis pigmentosa huntington’s disease cancer immunotherapy and intractable neuropathic pain our technology standard rnai approach many diseases are known to be caused by the inappropriate expression of a gene or multiple genes it has been observed since  that rna interference or rnai is a mechanism that can potentially be used to specifically turn off or silence genes whose sequences are known thus rnai can potentially be used to treat or cure diseases with a genetic basis by targeting a specific region of the molecular sequence of the diseasecausing gene rnai is potentially applicable to over  human genes and a large number of diseasecausing microorganismspecific genes the mechanism of action of rnai involves the introduction of short interfering rna or sirna into a cell the sirna’s sequence is constructed to match a short region of the target gene the sirna is processed by the cell’s own enzymes to destroy the target gene’s messenger rna or mrna thus preventing the diseasecausing gene from being expressed this occurs as long as the sirna remains prevalent in the cell our ddrnai approach our approach differs from the standard rnai approach which is commonly referred to as sirna which is being developed by several other companies including alnylam pharmaceuticals inc or alnylam tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation or tekmira and dicerna pharmaceuticals inc or dicerna in this standard rnai approach doublestranded sirna is produced synthetically and subsequently introduced into the target cell either by chemical modification of the rna or by a range of other delivery methods while clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for a number of indications utilizing this approach it has a number of limitations which include • treatment requires repeat administration for multiple cycles in order to maintain its efficacy • patient adherence challenges due to dosing frequency and treatment duration • therapeutic concentrations of sirna are not stably maintained because the levels of synthetic sirna in the cells decrease over time • novel chemical modifications or novel delivery materials are typically required to introduce the sirna into the target cells making it complicated to develop therapeutics • limited ability to target diseases of tissues other than the liver • can have an adverse immune response or interferon response potentially resulting in serious adverse effects • requirement for specialized delivery formulations for those diseases caused by multiple diseasecausing genes and • sirna only acts to silence genes but cannot be used to replace defective genes with normally functioning genes our ddrnai technology is designed to utilize the specificity and gene silencing effect of rna interference while overcoming many of the limitations associated with the ongoing administration of sirna our ddrnai approach combines rna interference with gene therapy unlike sirna our ddrnai technology starts with a dna construct gene therapy vectors which are carrier molecules often viruses that deliver genetic material into the cell are used to deliver the dna construct to the nucleus of the targeted cells the dna construct then generates doublestranded short hairpin rnas or shrnas which are processed by the cell into sirnas which in turn silence the diseaseassociated genes advantages of our ddrnai approach include • ddrnai is designed to produce sustained longlasting silencing of the diseasecausing gene following a single administration leading to the potential for “one shot” cures for a wide range of diseases which could eliminate the requirement for patient compliance to take regular doses of medicine for longterm management of their disease • ddrnai technology can target a wide range of tissues including but not limited to the liver • ddrnai uses the cell’s own transcriptional mechanisms to produce a constant level of shrna so that intracellular levels of sirna do not fall below threshold levels required for disease suppression • the level of shrna in the cells can potentially be finetuned to achieve optimal concentrations • offtissue effects can be minimized • the dna constructs are shielded in gene therapy vectors that are designed to avoid activating the interferon response • ddrnai provides the option to both silence the defective gene and replace the defective gene with a normal version • ddrnai can be designed to express multiple sirnas in the same cell targeting either a single gene at several different sites to minimize the risk of viral resistance or multiple genes in distinct cellular pathways potentially enabling treatment of complex genetic diseases such as cancer diabetes and heart disease and • ddrnai can elicit longterm response by continued expression of sirna from a single administration potentially preventing viral reinfection our pipeline proceeds from this offering with our existing cash and cash equivalents will advance our product candidates for hepatitis c hepatitis b amd and opmd additional financing apart from this offering will be needed to advance our product candidates for hepatitis c hepatitis b amd and opmd through clinical trials and to conclude preclinical trials for our product candidate for nsclc our lead product candidate tt which currently is in a phase iiia firstinhuman clinical trial is being developed to treat patients chronically infected with the most common genotype gt of the hepatitis c virus or hcv we expect to receive efficacy data in the fourth quarter of  if the results of the trial are favorable we anticipate commencing a phase iibiii trial in the second quarter of  subject to obtaining additional funding outside this offering of the six patients who have been dosed thus far in the phase iiia trial there have been no treatmentrelated serious adverse effects observed all six patients have been biopsied and we have seen shrna expression in the three patients for whom results have been reported we believe based on preliminary results from three patients that tt has clinical proof of concept for the production of shrna in the liver from a single administration according to the world health organization or the who  million to  million individuals worldwide have chronic hepatitis c hepatitis c is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma which often requires a liver transplant patients suffering from hcv have limited treatment options that require adherence to strict recurrent treatment regimens cause debilitating side effects that can cause patients to deviate from their prescribed treatment regimen and lack the ability to prevent reinfection we believe tt represents the first systemic administration of a ddrnaibased therapeutic making us the only company to date to advance into a clinical trial an rnai therapeutic for systemic administration by gene therapy vectors we are also developing hepbarna which currently is in preclinical studies for the treatment of the hepatitis b virus or hbv we plan to file an investigational new drug or ind application in the first quarter of  hbv is a small dna virus that according to the who infects up to  million people worldwide resulting in up to  deaths per year infection with hbv occurs in phases ranging from a silent acute phase that can be resolved by the immune system to a persistent chronic infection requiring lifelong therapy in the case of a chronic hbv infection the presence of viral particles and proteins particularly the santigen causes hepatic inflammation leading to liver dysfunction acute hepatic failure cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffering from hbv have limited treatment options from therapies consisting of antivirals and less commonly interferon therapy these treatments require adherence to strict recurrent treatment regimens may cause the hepatitis b virus to mutate and develop antiviral drug resistance and may only provide viral suppression through the course of administration and not a cure the longterm use of interferon particularly in high doses may also be associated with significant side effects including nausea vomiting shortness of breath dizziness and fatigue that can cause patients to deviate from the course of treatment hepbarna is designed to be a single administration ddrnaibased monotherapy that is delivered using a gene therapy vector that targets the liver and inhibits viral replication and santigen production on a longterm basis as both hbv and hcv replicate in the liver we have designed hepbarna to mimic the design elements of tt which we believe could help expedite hepbarna’s regulatory pathway in addition to tt for hcv and hepbarna for hbv we are focusing on developing product candidates to treat amd and opmd we will require additional financing apart from this offering to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates for hbv amd and opmd and to conclude preclinical trials for our product candidate for nsclc for selected product candidates at the appropriate stage we may collaborate with large pharmaceutical companies to further develop and if approved commercialize them to achieve broad product distribution for certain products we deem to be outside of our immediate focus we will continue to outlicense where appropriate applications of our ddrnai technology for the development of a range of therapeutics which we believe could provide

ended march     the company’s directors present their report on the consolidated entity consisting of benitec biopharma limited ‘company’ and the entities it controlled ‘group’ at the nine months ended march     directors   the following persons were directors of benitec biopharma limited the ‘company’ or ‘benitec’ during the whole of the period and up to the date of this report unless otherwise noted   mr peter francis chairman   mr kevin buchi   dr john chiplin   mr iain ross   dr peter french retired december     financial update   benitecs comprehensive loss for the nine months to march   was a million compared to a comprehensive loss of a million for the previous corresponding period   operating revenue was a million compared to a million in the previous corresponding period operating expenses were a million compared with operating expenses in the previous period of a million   the nine month loss includes research and development spending of a million compared to a million in the previous corresponding period benitec acquired full rights to its preclinical hepatitis b program from its collaborator biomics biotechnologies for a million with plans to independently progress the product candidate in this therapeutic field   benitecs current assets at march   were a million june   a million with current liabilities of a million june   a million   review of operations   benitec’s novel proprietary therapeutic technology combines gene silencing and gene therapy with a goal of providing sustained longlasting silencing of diseasecausing genes from a single administration dnadirected rna interference ‘ddrnai’ is being used to develop a pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of numerous chronic and lifethreatening human diseases such as hepatitis b ‘hbv’ agerelated macular degeneration ‘amd’ and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ‘opmd’   by combining the specificity and gene silencing effect of rna interference with gene therapy ddrnai has the potential to produce longlasting silencing of diseasecausing genes from a single administration which could eliminate the requirement for patient compliance to take regular doses of medicine for longterm management of their disease   the company has set the following priorities   · progress its pipeline of proprietary ddrnaibased therapeutics   o on february   the company announced that it would winddown its hepatitis c program and terminate the program upon completion of patients in cohort  in its phase iiia clinical trial for tt further detail on the termination of the program is included in ‘in house programs’ later in this report   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        benitec is committed to completing the collection of trial data and monitoring patients through the required four and a half year longterm safety followup period final data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be reported in q  when the study is completed although the hepatitis c program is being discontinued it is important to note that early stage tt clinical trial results indicated tt was safe and well tolerated meeting the primary endpoint of the study and as such will assist in other programs   o the other three therapeutic indications hbv amd and opmd are being progressed through their respective stages in the development pathway the company anticipates having completed in vivo preclinical proof of concept studies for all three indications by the end of calendar year  the company will require additional financing to conduct clinical trials with these product candidates further detail of individual programs is provided in subsequent sections of this review and results of operations   · continue the company’s leadership position in ddrnaibased therapeutics   o benitec remains the only company to date to advance an rnai therapeutic via systemic administration by gene therapy vectors   · further develop and improve the ddrnai platform technology and its associated intellectual property position   o develop inhouse ddrnai platform technology and program related intellectual property and inlicense complementary technologies as appropriate to support the product pipeline one such example is the company’s relationship with d molecular therapeutics llc dmt to develop a suitable vector to deliver the company’s ddrnai constructs to a large majority of the retinal cells of the eye from a single intravitreal injection to treat human ocular diseases   · develop drug candidates in benitec’s core disease areas and partner selectively to commercialise and expand the company’s pipeline   o selectively form collaborations to expand the company’s capabilities and product offerings into a range of diseases and potentially to accelerate the development and commercialisation of ddrnai therapeutics more broadly   o advance programs in core disease areas to appropriate stage of proof of concept to commercialise with pharmaceutical companies as an example benitec acquired full rights to its preclinical hepatitis b program from its collaborator biomics biotechnologies to enable the independent progression of the product candidate and simplify partnering negotiations   o where appropriate we seek to progress one or more programs through to commercialisation for example benitec’s pipeline program to treat an orphan indication opmd is seen as a candidate for this approach   o outlicense use of ddrnai for applications and therapeutics outside of the company’s immediate focus to expand benitec’s franchise of ddrnaibased therapeutics as an example benitec licensed ddrnai to circuit therapeutics to develop the technology in the area of intractable pain   · pursue indications with high unmet medical need or large patient populations   o programs currently being pursued at benitec are severe diseases with high unmet medical need or large patient populations that have well characterised gene targets that can be silenced thus preventing the diseasecausing gene from being expressed   o the company also intends to develop ddrnai applications in novel technologies such as chimeric antigen receptor t cells or car t for a range of additional disease areas   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page       inhouse programs   click to enlarge   as of march   benitec has three pipeline programs in development using the capital raised from the successful nasdaq listing in august  and the capital raised in april  the company continues to progress these development programs highlights of progress over the previous  months include    hepatitis b – bbhb the company is developing bbhb for the treatment of hbv which infects up to  million people worldwide resulting in up to  deaths per year the key features and milestones of the hbv program are as follows   o bbhb is designed to be a single administration ddrnaibased monotherapy or to be used in combination therapy with other antiviral medications bbhb is delivered using a gene therapy vector that targets the liver and inhibits viral replication as well as restricts viral rna levels and subsequent hbv protein production on a longterm basis as both hbv and hcv replicate in the liver benitec has designed bbhb to mimic the design elements of tt which might expedite the regulatory pathway of this drug   o in july  the company acquired full rights to bbhb from chinabased biomics biotechnologies to facilitate independent development and simplify partnering opportunities benitec made the decision to develop bbhb as a solelyowned program   o in october  the company entered into a manufacturing services agreement with lonza inc to develop a scalable manufacturing process for benitec’s ddrnai products delivered by adenoassociated virus aav capsids   o in december  the company announced positive in vitro data demonstrating the efficacy of bbhb and supporting the progression of bbhb into in vivo preclinical testing the data was presented at the hepdart  conference in the us in december    benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        o in march  the company announced results of its recent in vivo efficacy study of bbhb key findings of the in vivo study indicate that a single bbhb treatment in the phoenixbio pxb mouse model can result in suppression of hbv these results demonstrate the potential utility of an approach that combines rnai with gene therapy to treat hbv and the company intends to advance the hbv program towards the clinic the hepatitis b program continues to attract considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies and   o subject to additional financing the company plans to file an investigational new drug ‘ind’ application in the third calendar quarter of     agerelated macular degeneration ‘amd’ amd is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the united states affecting an estimated  million people and it is estimated that  million people will be affected by amd worldwide by  the aim of this program is to develop a therapeutic that provides longterm treatment of amd from a single intravitreal injection the company believes this could replace the need for regular injections of therapeutics into the eye which is the current standard of care the key milestones achieved over the last  months and next steps include   o three ddrnaibased therapies are in development – bbamd and bbamd for the treatment of wet amd and bbamd for the treatment of both wet and dry amd   o the company has entered into collaboration with d molecular therapeutics dmt for the development of the delivery vector for ocularbased ddrnai products due to the need for an extra round of screening vector development is now expected to be completed in the second quarter of  but continues to show excellent progress towards identifying novel capsids   o in vivo proof of concept studies are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year  and   o subject to additional financing the company plans to file an ind application by the end of calendar year     oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy opmd benitec is developing a ddrnai treatment for the treatment of opmd in this novel treatment the company is developing a “knock down  replace” approach silencing a mutant gene in conjunction with its replacement with healthy wild type gene opmd is an autosomaldominant inherited slowprogressing lateonset degenerative muscle disorder that usually starts in patients during their s or s the disease is manifested by progressive swallowing difficulties dysphagia and eyelid drooping ptosis opmd is caused by a specific mutation in the polyabinding protein nuclear  or pabpn gene opmd is a rare disease and has been reported in at least  countries patients suffering with opmd are well identified and are aggregated in particular regions which we believe should simplify clinical development and in house commercialisation key milestones achieved over the last  months and next steps include   o preliminary in vivo studies in an animal model of opmd have been completed and the results support the proof of concept of this approach with individual components this data was presented at the th annual meeting of the british society for gene and cell therapy that was held in london uk on april     o in august  the company signed an extension to the collaboration agreement with royal holloway university of london work is ongoing to finalise the proposed clinical candidate and to optimise the in vivo delivery and   o the company plans to progress the program through in vivo proof of concept with the proposed clinical candidate by the end of calendar year    benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        hepatitis c – ‘tt’ on february   the company announced that due to a lack of a sustainable commercial path it would winddown a partially completed phase iiia clinical trial for its now discontinued product candidate tt   early data from the clinical trial of tt indicated that tt was safe and welltolerated meeting the primary endpoint of the study however as a result of the increasingly competitive landscape among available hcv therapies in february  the company concluded that the tt program no longer offered the commercial value necessary to attract a worthwhile commercial partnership deal and as a result did not warrant additional expenditure or focus of its resources beyond completion of the existing patients the company believes the early stage tt clinical trial results provide valuable data that supports and validates the company’s ddrnai technology platform and other pipeline programs particularly liverbased indications benitec is committed to completing the collection of trial data and monitoring patients through the required longterm safety followup period   the key achievements over the reporting period for the hcv program are as follows   o the four clinical sites participating in the study include the duke clinical research unit university of california san diego the texas liver institute and methodist health system clinical research institute in dallas   o nine patients have been dosed to date and   o data from patients in the early cohorts were presented at the american association for the study of liver diseases aasld conference in san francisco in december  this data indicates that a single infusion of tt is reaching the liver and has a favourable safety profile these interim results on safety and clinical activity are in line with expectations   benitec remains focused on advancing its other pipeline programs including hepatitis b agerelated macular degeneration amd and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy opmd the company believes that each of these programs presents attractive commercial opportunities in particular the hepatitis b program is attracting considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies based on this interest the promising in vivo data announced in march and the significant potential market opportunity benitec will now prioritise the hepatitis b program as its next candidate for clinical development   benitec is committed to completing the collection of all trial data and monitoring patients through the required longterm safety followup period for the hcv trial in addition final data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be reported in the last quarter of  calendar year once the study is completed   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        licensed programs   in addition to the company’s inhouse development programs benitec has licensed its ddrnai technology to companies who are developing therapeutic programs in five disease areas each of them provides a potential opportunity for further clinical validation of the technology and potential revenue opportunity these licenses have been granted to small earlystage biotechnology companies with modest upfront and early development milestone payments and greater milestone payments due upon laterstage program success   the following table sets forth our outlicensed product candidates and their development status   click to enlarge   · hivaids in march  benitec

statements management undertakes a number of judgements estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets liabilities income and expenses the actual results may differ from the judgements estimates and assumptions made by management and will seldom equal the estimated results   the judgements estimates and assumptions applied in the interim financial statements including the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied in the consolidated entitys last annual financial statements for the year ended june     grant revenue is generated through the australian federal government’s research and development tax incentive program under which the government provides a cash refund for the  of eligible research and development expenditures because the grants are determined by the australian government following the completion of a fiscal year based upon eligible research and development expenditures grants are recorded in the fiscal year received

period to march   include the following   · closed an initial public offering in the united states with listing on the nasdaq   in august benitec closed its us initial public offering the gross proceeds from the offering were a million us million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses net proceeds from the offering will be used primarily to advance benitecs therapeutic programs   · acquired full rights to hepatitis b program and announced positive in vitro and in vivo data with hbbb   in july benitec acquired the full rights to its preclinical ddrnaibased hepatitis b therapeutic program which was previously a joint development between benitec and biomics the initial collaboration allowed benitec to make significant advances in the program based on promising in vitro data benitec made the decision to develop bbhb as a wholly owned pipeline program by acquiring biomics’ share in exchange for ordinary shares and cash consideration since acquiring full rights benitec has continued to progress the program   · entered into a manufacturing services agreement with lonza   in october benitec entered into a manufacturing services agreement with lonza houston inc to develop a scalable manufacturing process for benitec’s ddrnaibased adenoassociated virus aavdelivered products intended for therapeutic use in humans   · ceased further development of tt for the treatment of hepatitis c   on february   the company announced that it would winddown its hepatitis c program and terminate the program upon completion of patients in cohort  in its phase iiia clinical trial for tt further detail on the termination of the program is included in ‘in house programs’ earlier in this report   benitec is committed to completing the collection of trial data and monitoring patients through the required longterm safety followup period for the hcv trail in addition final data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be reported in the last quarter of  calendar year once the study is completed although the hepatitis c program has been discontinued it is important to note that early stages of the tt clinical trial indicated that tt was safe and well tolerated meeting the primary endpoint of the study and as such will assist in other programs   benitec biopharma limited interim

months ended march   page       management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and review of operations   operating results   we are a clinicalstage biotechnology company with a pipeline of inhouse and partnered therapeutic programs based on our patented genesilencing technology ddrnai we are developing treatments for chronic and lifethreatening human diseases such as hepatitis b agerelated macular degeneration and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy based on this technology in addition we have licensed ddrnai technology to other biopharmaceutical companies that are progressing their programs towards or are in clinical development for applications including hivaids retinitis pigmentosa huntington’s disease cancer immunotherapy and intractable neuropathic pain   our focus has been validating our ddrnai platform technology including the phase iiia clinical trial of tt a therapy for hepatitis c we reported in february  our plans to discontinue the tt program for commercial reasons early stages of the clinical trial indicated tt was safe and welltolerated in the nine patients dosed in the clinical trial the success of this “first in human” trial is a key step in validating ddrnai for therapeutic use providing the opportunity to progress benitec’s other inhouse programs in similar manner applying the key lessons learned by advancing tt to the clinic in the near future we expect to earn revenue from partnering inhouse programs with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies forming strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and outlicensing the ddrnai platform for therapeutic areas outside of the company’s inhouse pipeline there can be no assurance however as to whether we will enter into any additional such arrangement or what the terms of any such arrangement could be   during the first part of  the company focused on internal changes to position it for future success this included an indepth review of its scientific pipeline to ensure efforts are focused on those areas with a high probability of return on investment and commercial success in parallel to this review and reprioritisation of programs the company restructured and consolidated internal and external resources to reduce annual expenses and extend the cash runway project management practices have been enhanced to ensure that future activities are outcome driven and that there is improved control over timelines deliverables and cash management   we have incurred losses from operations in each year since inception our net loss in the  months to march   was a million and in the previous corresponding period to march   a million our net losses were a million a million and a million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively the majority of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years and over future fiscal years we expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities as we   • pursue clinical proof of concept across our programs including treatments for hepatitis b amd and opmd   • continue preclinical development of cell therapy and immunotherapy programs through preclinical proof of concept   • continue our research and development efforts for the refinement of ddrnaibased technology   • seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and   • add additional personnel and resources to support our product development and commercialisation efforts   we may generate revenue from licensing programs strategic alliances or collaboration arrangement with pharmaceutical companies these arrangements are likely to be more appealing to them when our pipeline is more advanced we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates which we expect will take a number of years is subject to significant uncertainty and may never occur   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and review of operations continued   we will continue to pursue licensing programs strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and we regard this as our key value creation opportunity unless and until we are able to gain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates and decide to commercialise it ourselves if we were to decide to take one or more product candidates to commercialization on our own the process of obtaining regulatory approval for the selected programs and building the commercial infrastructure that would be necessary to commercialise them if approved would require substantial additional funding   our current operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned these additional funds could be raised through public or private equity or debt financings although debt financings are unlikely to be available until we have significant revenue and cash flow to service debt we may incur government or other thirdparty funding strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches however we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favourable terms or at all our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and compromise our ability to develop our product candidates and pursue our strategy   we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development in our field we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to generate product revenue or achieve or maintain profitability our ability to generate revenue from licensing strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements and product sales will depend on a number of factors including among others obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payors for any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval even if we are able to generate revenues from licensing programs strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements or commercial sale of our products we may not become profitable if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and we could be forced to reduce our operations   financial operations overview   revenue   to date we have derived revenues from licensing fees the australian federal government’s research and development tax incentive program and interest income we have not generated any revenues from the sales of products revenues from licensing fees and the tax incentive program are included in the revenue line item on our statements of profit or loss   our licensing fees have been generated through the licensing of our ddrnai technology to biopharmaceutical companies   our grant revenue is generated through the australian federal government’s research and development tax incentive program under which the government provides a cash refund for the  of eligible research and development expenditures including salaries by small australian entities having a tax loss for this purpose small australian entities are defined as those with less than a million in revenue this grant is available for our research and development activities in australia as well as activities in the united states to the extent such usbased expenses relate to our activities in australia do not exceed half the expenses for the relevant activities and are approved by the australian government because the grants are determined by the australian government following the completion of a fiscal year based upon eligible research and development expenditures grants are recorded in the fiscal year received or anticipated to be received when a reliable estimate can be made rather than the fiscal year to which they relate   we also record interest and other financial income earned from bank accounts term deposits and shortterm investments as other revenue in our statements of profit or loss   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        financial operations overview continued   employment related costs   employment related costs include salaries for all our employees and related benefits including the grant of share options which are valued and included in the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as share based expenses   impairment   we assess at the end of each fiscal year and half year whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired if any such indication exists or when annual impairment testing is required for an asset such as goodwill intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use we make an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount an asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value in such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs when the carrying amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount the asset or cashgenerating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount   in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognized in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset unless the asset is carried at revalued amount in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease   royalties and license fees   benitec pays royalties and license fees in connection with our licensing of intellectual property from third parties in connection with our acquisition of tacere in  we agreed to pay to the former shareholders of tacere royalties on certain licensing revenue earned by us through the license of certain products including tt covered by a patent controlled by tacere in october  any such royalties would be calculated as follows  if the license is entered into prior to commencement of a phase iii clinical study and  if the license is entered into after commencement of a phase iii clinical study also if we were to directly sell these products then we would pay a royalty of  on net sales to the former shareholders of tacere   in august  benitec entered into a collaborative agreement with biomics biotech co ltd or biomics pursuant to which we agreed to share any revenue generated from commercializing our jointly filed patents which relate to singlestranded rna and shrna sequences for treatment of hepatitis b in july  we entered into an earnout agreement with biomics pursuant to which we acquired all rights title and interest in these patents in exchange for upfront and milestone payments at the time of signing the agreement we paid biomics a million consisting of a million in cash and  ordinary shares having a value of a at the time the agreement was entered into these shares could not be traded until october   and thereafter biomics may only sell up to a in value of those shares in any calendar month upon outlicensing a patent in this patent family we will also pay biomics  of the initial licensing revenue received by us up to a maximum of a million and in the event we receive licensing revenue greater than a million we would pay biomics  of licensing revenue on any such additional amounts   in august  benitec entered into a commercial license arrangement with newsouth innovations pty limited or nsi of university of new south wales for the patent portfolio relating to our therapy product candidate for nsclc the license provides for modest upfront and ongoing license fees and also milestone and single digit percentage royalty payments on net sales a percentage of sublicensing revenue is also payable to nsi we may terminate the license at will and in the event of certain breaches by nsi nsi may terminate the license in the event of certain breaches by benitec although benitec recently decided to discontinue the nsclc program the license has not been terminated by either party   benitec

of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we analyse our estimates and judgments and we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from our estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note  to these periodic financial statements and are detailed in note  to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   which are

recent losses we have not recognised a deferred tax asset with regard to unused tax losses and other temporary differences as it has not been determined whether we or our subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income against which the unused tax losses and other temporary differences can be utilized we note that the availability of tax losses is subject to an australian continuity of ownership test or if we fail that test the same business test if we continue to obtain funding from new shareholders then we may not comply with the continuity of ownership test   certain differences between ifrs and us gaap   ifrs differs from us gaap in a few respects while we have not assessed the materiality of differences between ifrs and us gaap we note in particular that ifrs permits the recording of finance income and research and development grants as revenue unlike us gaap under which interest and other finance income would not be recorded as revenue but instead as net finance income and research and development grants would be recorded as an offsetting reduction to research and development expenses in addition under ifrs all employmentrelated expenses are reported in their own line item in our statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income unlike us gaap under which employmentrelated expenses are generally allocated to line items such as research and development expense or general and administrative expense based on the functions performed by each applicable employee   the following discussion relates to our consolidated results of operations

gain                       licensing revenue and royalties increased very slightly from the nine months ended march   to the nine months ended march   primarily due to timing differences in the recognition of such revenue   finance income decreased by a million from a million in the nine months ended march   to amillion in the nine months ended march   as a result of holding cash in low

significant increase in the australian government rd claim reflects the increased eligible expenditure on rd in fiscal    expenses   research and development expense research and development expense increased by a million from a million in the nine months year march   to a million in the nine months ended march   primarily due to   · acquiring for a million the full rights to its preclinical

of patients in our phase iiia clinical trial for tt and   · the execution of an agreement with d molecular therapeutics llc or dmt to develop vectors   employment related expenses employmentrelated expenses increased by a million in the nine months ended march   compared to the nine months ended march   due to increased staff levels particularly at taceres laboratory in    benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        results of operations continued   share based expenses   share based expenses increased by a million from a million in the nine months ended march   to a million in the nine months ended march   largely due to the share based expense costs for options granted to directors on november   at the company’s annual general meeting share based expenses are calculated using a blackscholes model the share based expense model uses a data set that includes share price and exercise price exercise probability volatility exercise time and interest rates variation in these factors and an increased level of option grants to staff were the major contributors to this expense increase we recognize share based expenses over the service period in which the employee earns the award which is the vesting period of the award   travel related costs   travel related costs increased by a million from a million in the nine months ended march

given our and our subsidiaries’ history of recent losses we have not recognized a deferred tax asset with regard to unused tax losses and other temporary differences as it has not been determined whether we or our subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income against which the unused tax losses and other temporary differences can be utilized   b liquidity and capital resources   we have incurred cumulative losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception in  and as of june   we had accumulated losses of a million and at march   we had accumulated losses of a million we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years we expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and as a result we will need additional capital to fund our operations which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings debt financings other thirdparty funding and other collaborations strategic alliances and licensing arrangements   we have had no borrowings in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  or in this nine months to march   and do not currently have a credit facility   as at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of a million june   a million cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation currently our cash and cash equivalents are held in bank accounts our shortterm investments consist of term deposits with maturity within  days   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page         results of operations continued   operating capital requirements   to date our sources of liquidity have been licensing revenue and royalties australian government research and development grants interest on invested cash in excess of immediate requirements and proceeds of the issuance of equity securities   in the future we expect our revenue stream will be generated mostly from licensing strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies while we continue to progress discussions and advance opportunities to engage with pharmaceutical companies and continue to seek licensing partners for ddrnai in disease areas that are not our focus there can be no assurance as to whether we will enter into such arrangements or what the terms of any such arrangement could be   while we have established some licensing arrangements we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales we do not know when or if we will generate any revenue from product sales we do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates   unless and until we establish significant revenues from licensing programs strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or from product sales we anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of product candidates and begin to prepare to commercialize any product that receives regulatory approval we are subject to the risks inherent in the development of new gene therapy products and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business   we have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to   • the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials for our product candidates   • the timing and costs of our planned preclinical studies for our product candidates   • the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue   • the outcome timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals   • revenue received from commercial sales of any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval   • the terms and timing of any future collaborations licensing consulting or other arrangements that we may establish   • the amount and

  • the extent to which we need to inlicense or acquire other products and technologies   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page       results of operations continued   c research and development patents and licenses etc    research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates which include   • expenses incurred under agreements with academic research centres clinical research organizations and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and   • the cost of acquiring developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials   research and development expenses do not include employment related expenses which are included in our statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as a separate line item   research and development costs are expensed as incurred costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites   we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future product development preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates the duration costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors including   • the scope rate of progress and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical trials and other research and development activities   • the countries in which trials are conducted   • future clinical trial results   • uncertainties in clinical trial enrolment rates or dropout or discontinuation rates of patients   • potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies   • significant and changing government regulation and   • the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals   a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate for example if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrolment in any of our clinical trials we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development   we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of ddrnai product candidates and explore further potential applications of our technology   d trend information   our objective is to become the leader in discovering developing clinically validating and commercializing ddrnaibased therapeutics for a range of human diseases with high unmet clinical need or large patient populations and to thereby provide a better life for patients with these diseases our strategy to accomplish this goal is to progress our pipeline of proprietary ddrnaibased therapeutics continue our leadership position in ddrnaibased therapeutics develop drugs in our core disease area partner selectively to commercialize and expand our pipeline and pursue indications with high unmet medical need or a large patient population   benitec biopharma limited interim report for the nine months ended march   page        results of operations continued   the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to develop product candidates is based on the therapeutic use of ddrnai and the identification optimization and delivery of ddrnaibased product candidates is relatively new the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of successfully developing therapeutic treatments based on ddrnai is preliminary and limited there can be no assurance that any development and technical problems we experience in the future will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs or that such development problems can be solved

a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the
