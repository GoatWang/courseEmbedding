starbucks’ pumpkin spice latte by charlespassy reporter b and e dudzinscy  shutterstockcom slide  of  ’tis the season for pumpkin the great pumpkin invasion has begun once again america’s store shelves and restaurant menus are overflowing with pumpkin items — literally from soup to nuts as in pumpkin soup and pumpkin spice peanut butter naturally the trend has its roots in the runaway success that starbucks has enjoyed with its pumpkin spice latte or psl as the seasonal drink’s fans call it in fact the iconic beverage turns  in  — and starbucks is sure to add considerably to the  million psls it’s sold to date since the introduction but if you’re looking for what else is new or noteworthy in pumpkin we’ve done for the work here are  items to help you celebrate the season — by charles passy slide  of  pumpkin tea pumpkin spice it’s not just for coffee anymore in fact it’s for tea the proof tea retailer teavana has come out with its pumpkin spice brulee oolong billed as “a bountiful harvest of sweetness and spice” featuring dried pumpkin pieces green pumpkin seeds white and dark chocolate cinnamon ginger cloves allspice and nutmeg oh and yes oolong tea leaves another tea brand davidson’s also has its pumpkin spice tea — it suggests adding milk and sweetener to it to create a different kind of pumpkin latte slide  of  pumpkin air freshener sure you can inhale the aroma of a pumpkin latte but if you want that smell to stay in the air glade has got its limitedspice pumpkin spice fragrance collection replete with everything from a pumpkin spice scented candle to a pumpkin spice automatic spray with its hints of cardamom nutmeg ginger extract crystallized caramel and molasses the scent is described by the brand as “mouthwatering” but glade has competition in the pumpkin aromatherapy category for example air wick has its just released acadia sweet vanilla  pumpkins spray slide  of  pumpkin tortilla chips and you thought pumpkin snacks were limited to pumpkin seeds the folks at way better snacks have found a way to work pumpkin into a tortilla chip — specifically its oh my sweet punkin’ cranberry tortilla chips the healthconscious brand notes that pumpkin is a “great source of vitamin a and fiber” making this chip both “wholesome” and “a tasteful toast to the season” oh and if you need some pumpkin salsa to go along with those chips don’t worry celeb chef rick bayless has you covered with his chipotle pumpkin seasonal salsa slide  of  pumpkin cheese looking for another pumpkin topper for your chips — or for standalone snacking alouette the brand associated with all things french and cheesy has a pumpkin spice spreadable cheese — “perfect as an afternoon snack…or topped on pancakes for an easy sunday brunch” but alouette isn’t alone in wedding pumpkin with cheese the federal a miami restaurant now offers a roasted pumpkin mac ‘n’ cheese slide  of  pumpkin cannoli remember that classic “godfather” line “leave the gun take the cannoli” today that would be “take the pumpkin cannoli” stuffed artisan cannolis a new yorkbased bakery that specializes in the italian pastry offers its pumpkin pie cannoli during the season if cannoli sounds too fancy there are plenty of pedestrian pumpkin sweets including homer simpson’s favorite doughnuts both krispy kreme and dunkin’ donuts have pumpkinthemed doughnuts available this season slide  of  pumpkin mm’s we have pretzel mm’s raspberry mm’s and even an mm’s snack mix so why not a pumpkin mm’s product sure enough this year there’s mm’s pumpkin spice available through target if mm’s are not your candy of choice jelly belly has its own array of pumpkin chews slide  of  pumpkin bagel you might want to hold off on the smoked salmon accompaniment but yes there’s a pumpkin bagel — specifically panera bread’s pumpkin pie bagel it’s almost a bagelasdessert affair with a pumpkinspicecinnamon crunch topping and if that’s not enough sweetness for you panera adds a sprinkling of powdered sugar panera has the savory pumpkin front covered too — it just introduced vegetarian autumn squash soup made with butternut squash and pumpkin and topped with roasted and salted pumpkin seeds slide  of  pumpkin beer pumpkin beers have become so popular they’re almost as much a cliché as pumpkin spice lattes but capital city brewing co a chain of brewpub restaurants in the washington dc area is trying to up the game with its dr punkinstein — a pumpkin porter that also blends in chocolate and honey if you’re looking for more pumpkin with an alcoholic kick margaritas mexican restaurant a new england chain has unveiled a pumpkin sangria blending wine pumpkin pie syrup sugar cinnamonvanillaflavored vodka and fruit slide  of  pumpkin facial mask if there’s a big pumpkin trend in  it’s pumpkin cosmetics one example that caught our immediate eye michael todd true organics’ pumpkin facial mask — pumpkiny goodness that’s ready to be slathered on your skin in this case it’s a “nutrient rich” pumpkin blended with glycolic acid all designed to “remove dead skin impurities and toxins” and no you can’t eat it if you’d rather not go through the hassle of applying a mask you can opt for the straightforward alternative of a pumpkin soap — the yesteryear soap co makes a pumpkin spice bar soap slide  of  blue pumpkin of course if you really want pumpkin you can skip the spice and just buy well a pumpkin but if you’re going that route why not opt for a very different sort of squash freshdirect a new yorkbased grocery service offers an edible blue pumpkin — a
