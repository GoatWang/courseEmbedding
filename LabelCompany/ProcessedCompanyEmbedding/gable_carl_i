countryside a tall glass of prosecco in hand” –forbes fyi“palladian days lifts the notion of buying a summer house to dizzying and delightful new heights sally and carl gable’s fascinating account reads like a fastpaced marvelously satisfying adventure story” –john berendt author of midnight in the garden of good and evil and the city of falling angels author qa a conversation with sally gableq you began looking for a second home in new hampshire how on earth did that search lead you to a palladian villa in italya first of all carl and i didn’t really have a consensus about looking for a second home since i was born and raised in the white mountains and since carl and the children also loved that part of new england i had decided that a cottage near littleton maybe in franconia or sugar hill would provide an ideal summer spot carl had not agreed with this idea but he hadn’t disagreed either that was all the commitment i neededone sunday afternoon in april  as i curled up on our living room sofa to begin the new york times crossword puzzle i decided to flip through the real estate ads at the back of the magazine to see if any homes in upstate new hampshire were offered no luck on that but another ad caught my eye an alleged “palladian villa” not far from venice italy the attraction was twofold first carl and i had already made reservations to meet friends from london in the veneto in june for the precise purpose of visiting some of the palladian villas second since our trip there two years earlier venice was carl’s favorite city when i showed him the ad carl reacted with a disturbing amount of interest and phoned the real estate agent the next morning two years of onandoff negotiations lay aheadq why did you buy the villaa this is the question i am asked most often the answer is necessarily complicated because i’ve realized over time that my reasons were several  yes i fell in love with the villa immediately and wholly–emotionally sensually intellectually  to contemplate buying it and living there was like being asked to become a princess and live in a fairy tale  but i was ready to fall in love with an adventurous undertaking  our youngest child was preparing for college and the older two were off and launched in their lives  my husband had always been totally engrossed in his career and he still traveled a lotthis villa would– at least initially– be my adventure  i would be the first to learn italian i would be the first to make our home in this new country and become friends with our new neighbors i would be the first to study this architectural treasure and learn its myriad of secrets i could escape the totally familiar landscape of atlanta where i was often known as carl’s wife or our children’s mother and create my own world in piombino dese it was the opportunity for a new fascinating life on my own but as i spent more and more time in piombino dese– indeed living in my own world abroad– i realized that one reason i fell in love with the villa is because i felt from the beginning and still believe that the villa needs me me specifically to take care of it  to tend to its physical needs such as a new roof or new electrical switches but more important to bring life into it with visits from family and friends with concerts for the townspeople with croquet games in the backyard with luscious smells emanating from the kitchen  the villa needs me as much as i need the villaq was there ever a time like when you had scorpions as roommates that you thought oh my goodness what have we done tell us about some of the more harrowing homeowner experiencesa have you ever seen a scorpion up close they’re really sinisterlooking beasts but they never bothered me that much because i knew they were basically no more dangerous than a yellow jacket–which we get plenty of in atlanta pigeons are another story they look nice but are really flying guano machinesonly twice have i shuddered and asked myself “have we acquired a white elephant pastured  miles from atlanta the first was in our early years when i suddenly realized why giacomo our parttime custodian came running over from his cafè every time it rained yes he came to close the shutters on the north windows in order to protect the old panes but he was also gathering large containers from the basement to place in the upstairs grand salon to catch rainwater streaming down from leaks in the roof replacing the roof was a big immediate monetary challenge our second major problem was worse investigating a mysterious sag in the original terrazzo of the south upstairs porch carl and our contractor angelo discovered that the wooden beams supporting it had mostly turned to dust we were lucky the whole porch hadn’t collapsed on us while we were having an evening prosecco on the porch below angelo immediately erected support scaffolding all across the south face of the villa while we applied to the soprintendente di belli arte’s office for a permit to make the repairs permission arrived almost one year later in the meanwhile we were left to agonize each day over the wound to our beloved villaq how did the people of piombino dese greet the arrival of their newest residentsa my introduction to the piombinese was really quite remarkable particularly since they have an initial tendency to be cautious with strangers maybe it’s because in our first spring there i arrived at the villa entirely alone a certain circle of women– silvana miolo bianca battiston and a few other ringleaders–decided that i must be lonely at the villa by myself so one evening they planned a welcometotown pizza party there must have been  or  women there some of them are still among my best friends more than  years later that seemed to break the ice partly because it put me more at ease after a while strangers waiting in line at the butcher shop would offer me recipes others would stop me on the street to say that as children they attended the parochial kindergarten that was operated in the villa in the s they were eager to tell me of their mischievous exploits as students one day the pilot of an ultralite airplane someone we had never met waved at us as he flew bysimple curiosity of course was a factor in the community’s early interest in us but i think they sensed right away that we wanted to be piombinese ourselves we wanted to be neighbors not just visitors and for the most part that’s the way we’ve been accepted don aldo the head priest even publishes our christmas lettercard in the parish newsletter the piombinese seem glad that the villa is in the care of a family they respect the fact that thousands of people each year visit the palladian villa in their town they appreciate the opportunity to visit the villa themselves for concerts and plays and when like other local grandmothers i parade my visiting grandchildren all over town the piombinese make the same fuss over them that they do for their own q it’s hard enough maintaining a small apartment how does one begin to care for a home that includes  frescos and  pairs of shuttersa wonderful friends help us care for the villa first come silvana and giacomo miolo who own caffè palladio across the street in our book we describe giacomo as our own figaro because he answers our every need either himself or by finding the right person to assist us with their sons riccardo and leonardo silvana and giacomo schedule and supervise the visiting tour groups open and close the villa and all its shutters and introduce us to other people we need to know to take care of villa cornaro riccardo who was ten when we first arrived in piombino dese is now a graduate student in archeology he and i correspond via email about the needs of the villa during the winter months the whole family loves villa cornaro as fiercely as carl and i do and they are as protective of it as we arethe contractor who reroofed the villa and reconstructed the south portico angelo marconato has become a dear friend he works with his three sons and is a major builder in our region we occasionally join him and his wife on sunday evenings for their weekly family dinner which with their children and grandchildren brings twentytwo marconatos and spouses to the tableanother local friend and his son are our supervising engineers for projects at the villa and they recommend specialists such as a person to recreate the terrazzo on the south portico exactly like palladio’s original we also trade war stories with other villa owners who are very helpful with their suggestionsq you set out to learn much about the history of your home and of the famous architect who built it tell us some of the more interesting things you discovered about the villa and about palladio and the cornaro familya one of the great satisfactions of our lives in italy is that we are constantly discovering new things about the villa about palladio and about the cornaros– i mean every week every dayfor instance this past fall i worked at removing recent whitewash on the walls of two small rooms in the attic underneath the paint i discovered fantastic drawings of dragons ducklike creatures men in period costumes one of the dragons was clearly dated  plus there are many later signatures and dates all the way up to early twentieth century messages by italian soldiers billeted in the attic during the first world warcarl who has been studying the villa’s one hundred and four frescos for years has just made a breakthrough discovery of the book from which all the biblical images were taken and we learn so much from informed tourists who visit the villa one day a visitor looked at a nowheadless statue on the south portico and casually informed us that the subject was a pilgrim to santiago de compostela as proof she pointed to the shelllike emblem on the figure’s lapel another visitor has suggested that one of the frescos seems to be painted by a different hand we’re looking into itas for palladio the depth of his genius greets me each morning at the villa when i descend the west wooden stairs from our bedroom to the kitchen like one of bach’s great fugues the villa’s perfection is realized best by familiarity by daily study and constant reflection the cornaro family was one of the founding families of venice and involved in every event in its history we’ve just recently made contact with some cornaros in croatia who are direct descendants of giorgio cornaro who built our villa giorgio’s grandson was commander of venetian forces fighting in presentday croatia in the s and we’ve learned that one of his sons married and remained there imagine a family that can trace its own history more than one thousand yearsof course venice itself lies at our doorstep just  minutes away by train a thousand years is not enough to study all thisq how has owning this villa changed your livesa it seems just yesterday that i drove from marco polo airport cautiously approaching my new summer house alone for the first time i did not realize then how profoundly the villa would transform my life and me i barely understand it nowthere has been language to learn of course it was clear right away that i must speak italian or i would not be speaking at all i must learn great chunks of architecture and history or i would be no more than a camper in my own villa i must learn more about art or the train ride into venice would be pointless i must plumb new depths of human understanding and candor or i will never really communicate with my new neighbors i must find new courage to deal with the unknown and unfamiliar but politics i’m not sure even the italians understand italian politicsnow i’ve grown confident in my second world villa cornaro attracts princesses future first ladies cabinet members museum directors scholars magazine writers and tv interviewers and i’ve found a strength for dealing with it venetans have the remarkable ability for celebrating the artistry of every person for building their confidence to sculpt or paint or learn to play the cello or perhaps write a book this spirit has infected mean engaged life in italy especially in a palladian villa is a life filled with art and history as everyday companions so today i see the physical world differently from my first arrival at villa cornaro i observe spatial relationships differently i study the myriad colors in ordinary objects around me i feel in storms and sunny days the drama of the italian countrysidehow has owning this villa not changed our livesq what advice would you give to couples looking to buy a second home either here or abroada do it especially if it places you in a different culture not just a different setting especially if you want to expand your life to challenge yourself for me a second home should be a second life more than just a place to see your same old friends and think your same old thoughts with a different backdropour time in the veneto makes me feel  alive it fills me with a need to learn italian understand a new culture study new art hear new music watch new birds see new countryside learn new recipes a second home should be relaxing but i relax best when i’m busy without deadlines not when i’m idlefrom the hardcover edition related articles looking for more great reads download our

venetian glass sally gable portrays the villa the people who live in the surrounding countryside and their fading traditions which may be in their last generation in fluid prose she recalls the  negotiations that led to the couples purchase the previous inhabitants and her research into the history of the palatial house its  frescoes and palladio himself surmounting swarming bees and the usual maintenance problems the gables brought grandeur back to the villa eventually receiving house guests and film crews hosting dinner parties and staging cultural events this delightful mix of memoir travel guide and recipes is in essence a twist on these wellworn genresa very chic expensive twist at that photos agent kitty benedict july  copyright  reed business information library journal andrea palladio is often considered the most significant architect in the history of western art this is the story of an american couple who make his thcentury frescofilled villa cornaro located a few miles from venice their second home as they renovate restore and incrementally modernize the building they study its history provide guided tours and open the space for community arts performances this summer residence is also the base from which they explore venice and visit other palladian buildings in the area while learning to adapt to a life lived partially in the veneto region of italy while the book is filled with interesting anecdotes about the problems of maintaining a yearold home and the confusion that comes from adapting to another culture the author jumps from story to story without transition often leaving the reader contextually stranded palladian design venice and the villa itself are not covered in sufficient detail to recommend this book as a source on these topics appropriate only for larger armchair travel collections pertaining to italysheila kasperek north hall lib mansfield univ pa copyright  reed business information kirkus reviews when a palladian villa outside venice is your country home being houseproud comes with the territory but the gables who spend summers and winters in atlanta arent trying to prove anything here other than their good fortune as they tell readers what its like to live in such a monument in  hankering for a place in the country and not finding one in new hampshire sally gable whose sensible cultured voice provides the firstperson narration spied an ad in the new york times sunday magazine about the availability of a residence by thcentury master andrea palladio two years of negotiations followed before the superb piece of renaissance architecture was in their hands sally doesnt come right out and state the price though readers wont begrudge the gables their wherewithal carl is a lawyer and businessman for it is clear from the outset that they not only cherish the villa but feel a deep sense of responsibility for it whenever repairs are needed they always ask how would palladio have dealt with this problem of the  authenticated palladian structures in existence villa cornaro is a humdinger with both recessed and projecting double porticos  frescoes and abundant statuarynot to mention scorpions pigeons depositing yucky acidic gray excrement over our sixteenthcentury brick and terrazzo floors a leaky roof a primitive kitchen and some rotting joists though sally pays respect to the town its market and its citizens her principal concern is the villa she ferrets out its history figures out where it fits in the palladian oeuvre and tries to understand its small mysteries from why there are no frescoes in some of the main rooms no need for trompeloeil when the columns and niches and statues are real to why tunnels lead hundreds of feet to the lake primitive air conditioning maybe a hightoned social

miscellaneous  travel read an excerpt chapter pizza with palladio“signora sally tonight we’re going to a celebration of pizza”silvana miolo’s lilting italian greets me as i sip my morning espresso on the south portico of villa cornaro the low morning sun splashes shadows of lombardy poplars across the lawn of the park swallows circle and swoop bare inches above the closely mown lawn scooping insects from the warming air then spiraling upward to reclaim their nests somewhere above my head note to diary birds nesting in attic investigate“una celebrazione di pizza” is that what she saidsilvana senses my puzzlement and quickly finds an alternative way to frame her news the event i learn upon retelling will be a pizza partysilvana is a dervish of energy dark eyes dramatized by thick lashes and wavy black hair animate her face she has been friend italian teacher and villa savant since i cautiously drove the twenty miles from the venice airport two weeks ago for my first spring at the villa “remember the lady of a villa is called a villainess” my husband carl advised me soberly as we kissed goodbye in atlantacarl will join me in a few weeks i am alone for now in the sixteenthcentury villa designed by the architect andrea palladio that we have audaciously acquired in the village of piombino dese halfway to the foothills northwest of venice silvana is determined that i not feel lonely when i arrived from the airport she sent her tenyearold son riccardo to keep me company while i unpackedsilvana’s improbable plans for the evening have me uneasy because of my own recent introduction to italian but i’m heartened to find that i needed only one repetition before understanding what is in storesilvana and the other piombinesi i’ve met speak no english in fact they don’t ordinarily speak italian their first language is venetan pronounced vehnehtun a dialect substantially different in its vocabulary and pronunciation from standard italian and not readily intelligible to strangers whenever carl has trouble understanding something said in italian he tries to claim that the speaker is actually using venetan once carl remarked to local friends over dinner that the occasion was a good opportunity for the two of us to practice our italian for a whole evening “yes” ilario agreed surveying his family around the table “and it’s a good chance for us to practice our italian too”in succeeding years english will be taught more widely in the schools of piombino dese and the young people of the town will gain confidence in using it with us but in our early years no local people of our acquaintance speak it no one that is except ilario ilario mariotto and i are the same age but when i was leaving for college he was boarding a ship for australia where he would spend four hot exhausting years chopping sugarcane in the fields ilario can still speak halting english despite twentyfive years of disuse note to diary where has my college french goneeach morning i climb out of bed and assemble my limited italian verbs and nouns into imaginary dialogues with silvana trying to prepare myself for her arrival at eight o’clock she walks over from caffè palladio the bar and sandwich shop that she and her husband giacomo own and operate across the street from the villa her purpose is to open our balcone balcone is the venetan—not italian—word for shutters the villa has fortyfour immense pairs of them most of them more than ten feet tall in accordance with local custom and for security as well all of them must be closed and latched each night and opened each morning those on the ground floor are secured with a heavy steel bar lifted and fitted into slots on each side of the window opening for carl or me it would be a thirtyminute task every morning and night silvana or giacomo can do it in twenty their older son leonardo can do it in fifteen minutes but the process is a cacophony of shutters banging windows slamming glass rattling and steel clanging to wake the dead from their rest in the cemetery of the parish church a block away carl and i refer to it all as the “balcone ceremony” we quickly come to accept it as part of the rhythm of villa life even quicker however is carl’s decision—taken the previous october when we first arrived together as the new owners of villa cornaro—that the whole process should be delegated to giacomo and silvana in their moonlighting role as custodians of the propertyon my own now in my first spring at the villa i soon discover the true benefit of the arrangement silvana’s morning visits are my gateway to the world of piombino dese she brings me news of the village listens attentively to my carefully prepared yet nonetheless stumbling forays into italian conversation and generally presents mea role model for a donna in venetan lifesilvana never loses patience or laughs at my malapropisms she speaks with slow precision repeating phrases as often as necessary rearranging them as bits of a puzzle until the meaning is apparent even to an american novice my six months of lessons back in atlanta with lola butler an effervescent military bride from padua have drilled me in the basics of italian grammar but my brain is not prepared to process a nonstop stream of animated italian especially when the conversation turns to septic tanks sewers spigots drains and other topics that never arose in my dialogues with lola but grow to fill my life in piombino desea pizza party will be a baptism of fireeight cars have arrived ahead of us when we pull into the parking lot at pizzeria sombrero that evening and several others follow i’m in the dark about the guest list for this outing but i notice that all those climbing out of the automobiles are women each is immaculately dressed in tall heels and a smart suit many have bright scarves tossed elegantly across their shoulders with that infuriating insouciance i envy so we enter a brightly lighted room and take seats at a single long table stretching from one end to the other about forty women are present—at least thirtyfive of them complete strangers to me—and all are in high spirits and chattering rapidly silvana lifts her voice to tell me above the din that the women in town want to welcome me to piombino dese with a pizza party they are afraid i may be lonely at the villa by myselfi am afloat in a sea of introductions and mellifluous italian names lucia chiara emanuela pierina fiorella flora elena nadia enza maria rosa luigina francesca beer is flowing pizzas with microthin crusts follow in infinite variety seafood pizzas arrive topped with mussels and gamberetti—the whole mussels shells and all pizza maria with creamy white bufala mozzarella and a light sweet tomato sauce pizza with pungent arugula pizza striped with melanzaneeggplant and zucchini pizza decked with peperoni not the little salami slices these are green and red and yellow peppers from the garden i lose count of the pizzas just as i have already lost track of the names perhaps i lose track of the beer as well but most improbably i lose my selfconsciousness about speaking italian my grammar is no better my vocabulary is no larger but among friends what do such things matter as i wake the next morning alone in the huge villa in pitchblack because of the tightly closed balcone my head slightly disoriented from too much beer i smile with the realization that i have a new home among the women of piombino desechapter a home in new hampshireas i settle into the pace of piombino dese i sometimes wonder—sitting on the south portico in the evening with a glass of prosecco—how iever managed with the simplicity of only one life one circle of friends one language and i ponder how easily and quickly chance can divert the whole stream of one’s lifewhatever brought you to buy a palladian villa in italyit is a question carl and i never escape our atlanta friends ask tourists and tour guides ask occasional magazine writers and television interviewers ask and from time to time in these quiet moments we ask ourselves carl has developed a simple response “it was a full moon” i always answer with a longer version but sometimes i think that i am only telling how it happened and that i am still searching for the why myselfin the spring of  i decided that a wellordered atlanta family such as ours should have a second home in upstate new hampshire or possibly vermont although my mother was from oklahoma and my father from edinburgh scotland i grew up in littleton in the white mountains of new hampshire where my father was a doctor since carl seemed to be weaning himself from working all seven days of the week i felt the time was ripe for a country retreat a place where we might in thoreau’s phrase “live deliberately” two of our children were in college and the youngest was in high school i was cheerfully making fulltime work of my parttime post as music director of a small church near our home in atlanta the result of returning to school for a master’s degree in sacred music ashley carl and jim applauded their mother’s return to academia and found her examtime anxiety to be a special treat still my plate was not filled i determined that a vacation house would be a lodestone to draw the family together regularly and to retain familial—or at least friendly—ties through coming decades like our black labrador cleowith a new rawhide bone i seized the idea and began gnawing away at itvisions sprouted in my head a twostory clapboard cottage on sugar hill or a stone house along the banks of gale river its entranceway a spider web of climbing yellow roses the dreams were vivid in color scent and sound and particular to my native white mountainsa ream of national geodetic survey maps of northern new hampshire each tightly rolled and secured with a rubber band stood like a bouquet in a corner of our atlanta bedroom i’d accumulated the maps through the past ten years and on visits to my parents had driven over most of the roads depicted with little squiggly lines i was often accompanied by my aging garrulous scottish father whose legendary love of the mountains and streams of the region translated into exhilarating storytelling with all who chose to listen and some who didn’t perhaps we’d find just the home i’d pictured along skookumchuck brook running down the north slope of cannon mountain or maybe a perfect bungalow on the narrow ribbon of back road twisting from littleton to franconia where the presidential range rests like a purple velvet blanket tossed across the horizon or we might spot a cottage on skinny ridge road west of littleton where high silver pastures fall away to the midnight blue mirror of littleton lake placidly reflecting mount miseryi convinced myself that new hampshire is easily accessible from atlanta a twoandahalfhour flight to boston a quick stop at the car rental counter and then—with me driving instead of pokey carl—just two more hours to our country retreat carl was noncommittal when i floated the idea—i took to mean yes all that remained was forme to find at a bargain price the spot that i had conjured in my mindthat is my reason one sunday afternoon in late april  as i sit in our atlanta living room surrounded by a sea of brobdingnagian newspapers for pulling out the sunday magazine of the new york times rather than launch immediately into the crossword puzzle i begin to thumb the pages where ads appear for grand houses on long island and penthouses in manhattan and occasionally for summer houses in new england i have chosen a bad week for new england summer homes however not a single one is listed in the midst of my disappointment my eye stops at an unusually unattractive ad from a greenwich connecticut realtor for a villa in the veneto region of italy a villa allegedly designed by andrea palladio the most influential figure in the history of western architecturefrankly the whole thing seems implausible but an interesting coincidence nonetheless the coincidence lies in the fact that carl and i had made plans several months earlier for a july visit to the palladian villas in the veneto our friends from london judith and harold are to meet us therewith a “ha” i show the ad to carl and tell him that if i don’t find the right spot in new england we can always settle for our own palladian villacarl reacts with a disturbing amount of interest he pulls from our bookshelves the copy of michelangelo muraro’s venetian villas that we purchased several years earlier following a threeweek family vacation in florence with a quick side trip to venice there is villacornaro staring back at us in full color villa cornaro we discover is not just a palladian villa of the eighteen surviving villas designed by palladio it is one of the five largest best preserved and most influential in later architecture“but sally it’s enormous” judith complains two months later after the four of us have climbed from our small unairconditioned rental car parked in piazzetta squizzato to stare dumbstruck at first across the street at villa cornaro the villa looms above the ancient wall that surrounds it and above via roma as well placid and mysterious as the sphinx completely detached from the petty bustle of piombino dese on a scorching july day“enormous” judith repeats to emphasize her point “beautiful yes but very very big” her israeli accent flavors her words and adds to their authority“mammoth carl you’d need roller skates to get from one end to the other” harold’s grin suggests that he would be happy to don the skatesit’s a palace i think to myself carl keeps his thoughts to himself alsothe gate to the villa is ajar so we enter to see an elderly couple awaiting us on the north portico epifanio marulli a grayhaired gentleman with surprisingly bright blue eyes was custodian of the villa long before dick rush the current owner arrived on the scene eighteen years earlier and he has remained as dick’s custodian as well epifanio’s wife elena is with him from a distance they are dwarfed by the thick twentyonefoottall ionic columns rising to support the thinner corinthian columns of the floor above they smile shyly no doubt wondering as i am how they will communicate with these strangers who speak no italian harold confided earlier in the morning that he has a little “tourist italian” as he calls it left from vacations his family took when he was a teenager but carl and i have taken little comfort in it “that should be very helpful” carl kidded him “as long as you don’t get confused and ask the custodian for a gondola ride or an antipasto by mistake” show more meet the author sally gable a church music director by training has
