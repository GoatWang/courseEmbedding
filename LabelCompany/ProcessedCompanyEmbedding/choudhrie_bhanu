set to become experts in handling environmental issues clean tech’s world soon to become the center of gravity in emerging markets confirms bhanu choudhrie of cc alpha group  the speed of economic change can be overwhelming for those investing in the emerging markets it offers huge opportunities to the investors but at the same time it also poses some great challenges the social and cultural issues associated with changing markets cannot be overlooked as growth is directly associated with it  in the current scenario global warming comes across as the greatest challenge for investors with more than seven million people dying prematurely due to environmental pollution global warming is now a major issue for emerging economies worldwide  there is no doubt that global warming is the biggest threat to human health but it also has the potential to become the single biggest driver of economic transformation decarbonisation of economies can affect the world in big way it will not just affect the way we produce power but also transform the way we grow food and live our lives  expressing his concern about global warming and various environmental issues bhanu choudhrie said “it is often said that the sins of developed economies whose factories belched out fossil fuels throughout the th century are being visited on emerging markets at the very point that they are experiencing stellar economic growth for the first time they are being required to decarbonise just as demand from a nascent voracious middleclass is taking off  it is quite fascinating to notice that the innovation curve is moving east to west and north to south giving his opinion about some dramatic shifts in approach coming from emerging markets achim steiner former executive of the united nations environment program said “thailland advertises itself as a “sufficiency economy” and bhutan talks of “gross national happiness” –but these are not merely theoretical concepts these are national branding strategies which feed through to political implementation”  interestingly we all have this concept fixed in our minds that wealth and technology can make us independent on the contrary we are more dependent on it than ever before it is high time that all of us realize that we need to protect nature in order to survive at  no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare
