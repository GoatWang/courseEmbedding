jonas prising title chairman ceo company manpowergroup location milwaukee industry staffing wwwmanpowergroupcom in advance of the event teske and prising were interviewed by biztimes milwaukee editor andrew weiland the following are excerpts from those interviews biztimes your companies are doing business all around the world to get us started here what foreign markets is your company currently selling goods or services to teske “we market sell and service products in over  countries on six continents” prising “we operate in  countries and territories and have over  offices” biztimes what do you see happening with the economy in those foreign markets that you do business in how do the economies of these markets compare with the united states right now  teske “generally we see the united states market as being stronger than many of the international markets that we serve our primary international markets are europe brazil and australia the brazilian economy is struggling and is currently experiencing a recession europe seems to have stabilized however there seems to be caution based on recent moves made by the european central bank australia has been struggling in recent years due to the decline in mining but seems to be stabilizing” prising “postrecession economies globally have strengthened and businesses are adding to their payroll to respond to growing demand for products and services our most recent manpower employment outlook survey gives cause for optimism  of  countries and territories anticipate increasing their staffing levels in the second quarter of  we are seeing some signs of slowdown too though we believe parts of the global economy – including some countries in asia and latin america – will continue to experience softening as the result of demographic and economic influences in the us we are seeing positive signs with high employment rising wages albeit slowly and an uptick in productivity the us labor market is strong compared to the global situation with the economy still generating a sufficient number of jobs to keep the unemployment rate down however one thing is certain we now live in a world of ‘certain uncertainty’ where increased volatility may be here to stay it will become increasingly difficult to anticipate where growth may come from as a result organizations and individuals need to be more agile in order to better adapt to this rapidly evolving environment and a key differentiator to success is attracting and developing talent with the right skills” biztimes according to federal data wisconsin exports declined from about  billion in  to about  billion in  why do you think that happened do you think the state’s exports will rise this year teske “the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies has had an impact on wisconsin exports during  it is more expensive for foreign customers to import products from wisconsin although some currencies seem to have stabilized in  i believe the strength of the dollar will continue to weigh on wisconsin exports for the remainder of the year” biztimes is the strong us dollar making it more difficult to export your goods or services if so how is your company working to overcome that challenge teske “the strong dollar is making it more difficult to export goods abroad innovation continues to be key for driving demand for our products around the world delivering a strong value proposition helps offset the increased cost of products caused by a strengthening of the dollar” prising “simply put no we are not a commodity producer we are a provider of talent and in that respect a strong us dollar does not contribute to our business aggregates all our revenues are matched with our costs in local currency in the countries where we operate our reported results fluctuate with currencies but this is a currency translation effect” biztimes what advice would you give to companies that want to increase their export activity teske “local markets can differ in many ways from our domestic market such that a product designed and developed to meet domestic needs may not be appropriate for international markets it is important for companies to understand local market needs and then determine whether they can create value by developing new products or modifying existing offerings to meet those local needs also depending on the type of product it is important to have local support to serve customers” prising “choose markets where your product and services can be competitive and fit market needs well from a talent perspective you’ll need to understand the skills you will need to achieve your business goals and how you will find attract and retain those workers in any given country requires careful thought and planning talent is as critical as capital as a key economic differentiator if you are looking to expand abroad hiring individuals with a global mindset combined with local expertise will be critical you will also need to ensure your employees are able to adapt to changing business needs building learnability into training and development will ensure your workforce is agile and can respond to continued technological advances and disruption learnability is the ability and desire to learn quickly to increase one’s ability to contribute to the current world of work globally talent shortages continue to escalate so developing a robust and sustainable workforce strategy for overseas operations will be critical to success” biztimes looking ahead are there any new foreign markets your company hopes to enter in the next few years teske “we see opportunities for further expansion in south america latin america and eastern europe we are also looking for ways to participate in the economic growth of india and china” prising “we are always looking to grow our business in strategic markets and to expand to geographies which meet the needs of our clients we are already the most globally present company in our industry but are always exploring new markets for opportunities to deliver our services” biztimes what parts of the world are going to be the best export opportunities for wisconsin companies in the next few years teske “developing countries continue to be a source of export growth for wisconsin companies as industrial machinery is the largest export category for the state developed countries that are focused on replacing and enhancing infrastructure can also be a source of export growth continued advances in global health care will be a source of growth for medical and scientific instruments which were the second largest export category for the state in ” prising “there is no general rule of thumb in terms of markets that are of interest for a specific company it depends on the relative strengths of their products and services for any particular market generally speaking although many emerging markets are more volatile their economic growth is expected to outpace many more developed markets asia has particular strength in terms of their population growth with more people coming into the idle class and generating faster growing consumer markets” biztimes which industry sectors in wisconsin are going to have the best export opportunities in the next few years teske “i believe the top three export categories industrial machinery medical  scientific instruments and electrical machinery have solid opportunities for export growth over the next several years wisconsin companies are very innovative which helps us remain competitive however it is important that government policy at the state and federal levels be favorable toward exports this includes fair trade and tax policy that allows for our companies to compete in a highly competitive global economy” shareclick to print opens in new windowclick to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to share on linkedin opens in new
