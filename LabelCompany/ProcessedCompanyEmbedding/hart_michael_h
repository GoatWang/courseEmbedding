smartphone as a full featured hart communicator at the fraction of the cost of a hand held communicator    testimonials nice product  easy to use searched on the web and decided to take a chance with getting something to do hart on my pc instead of having to lug around a hart communicator  we are a systems integrator that performs field commissioning all over the world  my main expertise is plc programming and field commissioning  i have to lug around cables tools laptops etc and the devcom software and hart modem work out well for me when i do checks from devices back to the plc  since traveling with tools and equipment by airline is a hassle these days this system has filled a big void without requiring additional baggage your service is very good and your ability to make the customer feel like they are important goes beyond most of the vendors that i deal with a lot of the devices i check out are not in easily accessible areas on the skid  that makes the hart bluetooth modem especially appealing  i can climb up to the device connect it up and it enables me to keep my computer on the ground and not in awkward positions  since my laptop is my livelihood keeping it safe sound and secure is very important used every day since purchase  very useful the system has been one of the best field service aids that i have purchased  previously we had to share hart communicators and we only had two  there are six people in our organization that do the majority of field work so we were priority shipping the communicators all over the country  the devcom software and hart modem bring the system price to the level where everyone in a field service organization can have one  great product great support my company has several of the systems now and they become a hot item when going out to the field  it has saved us many hours of checkoutstartup time i want to thank procomsol because the factory support i have received has been outstanding  this is one of the things that i like to tell everyone when showing the system because good factory support is becoming harder to obtain  keep up the good work company profile procomsol ltd is a leader in the design and

hart had the nerve not only to select who he thought were the most influential people in history but also to rank them according to their importanceneedless to say the critics were wrong and to date over  copies of the book have sold hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage thus the publication of this revised and updated edition of the as before harts yardstick is influence not the greatest people but the most influential the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings determined the rise and fall of civilizations changed the course of historywith incisive biographies hart describes their careers and contributions explaining his ratings he presents a new perspective on history gathering together the vital facts about the worlds greatest religious and political leaders inventors writers philosophers explorers artists and innovators  from asoka to zoroaster most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketchesharts selections may be surprising to some neither jesus nor marx but muhammad is designated as the most influential person in human history the writers arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers but whether or not they agree with him his manner of ranking is both informative and entertainingthe  revised and updated is truly a monumental work it promises to be just as controversial just as thoughtprovoking and just as successful as its predecessor  a perfect addition to any history or philosophy reference
