then open the call to questions with that i will turn the call over to scott scott beiser thank you christopher hello everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal year  earnings call our cyclically balanced business model performed well in the first quarter of this fiscal year continuing a strong trend of yearoveryear growth we achieved another record for the first quarter of the fiscal year and we have now experienced five consecutive quarters of doubledigit revenue growth versus the prior year period we reported  million in revenues this quarter up  from last year and our best first quarter in the firm’s history our trailing month revenues are now in excess of  million once again all three of our business segments reported higher quarterly revenues when compared to the same quarter last year with respect to earnings our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were  up from  in the same quarter last year our strong earnings were driven by record revenues a decline in noncompensation expenses and an improvement in other income and expenses and slightly lower tax rates all compared to the same quarter last year overall a few macro trends continue to affect our results and will likely impact to future results since the us election stock prices continue to climb which bodes well for ma activity though many investors are getting cautious about general valuation multiples relative to growth corporate executives we speak with still have a positive outlook for their businesses a continued growth in earnings from current levels is getting harder to achieve access to capital especially in the middlemarket remains strong the number of new providers of debt continues to grow and the availability of capital across a variety of business purposes and transactions remains robust however financiers continue to watch the activity as central banks and their potential negative influence on monetary policy currently the lack of any clarity on us tax reform has not had a meaningful impact on midcap ma activity but continued uncertainty could influence future activity in valuation levels in corporate finance while midcap ma market statistics continue to show declines in activity houlihan lokey continues to report improved results we closed more transactions and at a higher average fee this quarter versus last year we also saw a slight increase in our new deal pipeline yearoveryear financial advisory services has recently experienced a resurgence in transaction opinion related work and our new intellectual property business which we bought last year has been successful on the broader houlihan lokey platform as previously mentioned in our last few earnings calls the financial restructuring business is expecting less energyrelated revenues than in previous quarters however we are experiencing a broadening of distressed opportunities across a variety of industries and geography now new business was more sporadic than in recent quarters and points to more volatility in future quarterly results for this product line now for some specific comments at each of our three business segments corporate finance generated revenues of  million for the quarter up  yearoveryear and  million for the trailing  months our growth was driven largely by an increase in the average fee size as well as a modest increase in the number of closed transactions this compares to a continued decline in global midcap ma activity we continue to believe our market share of midcap transactions is increasing reflecting the same trends that we have been experiencing over the last several years we remain focused on developing existing staff talents with  managing director promotions last quarter opportunistically hiring new talent with two new md hires as well as growing our overall md productivity by more than  in the last  months financial restructuring generated  million of revenues for the quarter up  yearoveryear and  million for the trailing  months while we showed continued revenue growth in financial restructuring this quarter we still anticipate pressure on future quarterly revenues relative to last year as we work our way through the bulk of our oil and gas related restructurings our financial restructuring business remains the most volatile of our three business segments and therefore the hardest to forecast a particular trend based on quarterly activity we believe we have one of the premier franchises in the business and should continue to be a global market leader in future financially distressed situations financial advisory services generated revenues of  million for the quarter up  yearoveryear and  million for the trailing  months financial advisory services experienced an increase in fee events as well as an increase in the average revenue per fee event for the quarter transaction opinion work was up substantially versus the same period last year we also saw growth in our portfolio valuation transaction advisory services and our new ip business recently we have accelerated our hiring efforts in fas and now have a record number of employees and mds dedicated to this business segment in the last quarter we promoted two mds and hired two mds we believe we are wellpositioned for future revenue growth as these new employees develop on our platform on the managing director front we remain disciplined in our development and search for talent either adding new capabilities or strengthening existing capabilities in this last quarter we added  mds across our three product lines  of these mds were from annual promotions and  were external hires we are pleased with the quality of talent we have been able to hire and coupled with our promotions continued to increase the firm’s overall capabilities in addition to hiring we continue to look at acquisition opportunities both in the united states and internationally and we are expecting to officially open an office in dubai in the second fiscal quarter the dubai office will expand the firm’s geographical footprint and allowed to better service existing and prospective new clients in closing we are pleased with our recent quarter’s financial results however we have been in this business long enough to know that market conditions change over time sometimes abruptly while we see no imminent signs of a change in market direction we constantly focus on building and sustaining the business we can one that will be successful regardless of the business political or economic business environment that we are in with that i will turn the call over to lindsey lindsey alley thank you scott revenues for the quarter were  million up  from the same quarter last year in addition adjusted earnings per share increased by  to  in corporate finance revenues were  million for the quarter an increase of  from the prior year this was a record first quarter of revenues for corporate finance against a backdrop of a sluggish middlemarket ma environment we closed  transactions in the quarter compared to  in the same period last year and our average transaction fee on closed deals was more than  higher financial restructuring revenues were  million for the quarter an increase of  from the prior year we closed  transactions in the quarter compared to  transactions in the same period last year but our average transaction fee on closed deals was lower compared with the same quarter last year energy restructurings continue to contribute significantly to our current financial restructuring revenues in financial advisory services revenues were  million for the quarter a  increase from the prior year fas saw growth in transaction opinions portfolio evaluation transaction advisory services and our new ip product line fas grew the number of fee events for the quarter by nearly  and also saw an uptick in the average fee revenue per event for the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year turning to expenses our adjusted compensation expenses were  million for the first quarter versus  million for the same period last year the increase in adjusted compensation expenses was primarily due to the increase in revenues for the quarter for the first quarter of fiscal  we had an adjustment of  million related to the investing of grants that were issued in connection with our ipo and we expect this adjustment to continue until our last tranche of preipo grants vest in april  this resulted in an adjusted awarded compensation ratio at  for the first quarters of both fiscal  and fiscal  we continue to target an adjusted awarded compensation ratio of between  and  and our gaap compensation ratio adjusted for preipo grants should be between  and  basis points lower than our adjusted awarded compensation ratio which is consistent with the  basis points difference that we experienced last year in may we issued approximately  million shares of deferred stock as compensation to employees as part of our year end bonus cycle our adjusted noncompensation expenses in the first quarter were  million or  of revenues versus  million or  of revenues in the first quarter last year we experienced a very efficient quarter in noncompensation expenses with declining tme and other operating expenses on higher revenues although we welcome this result it is not typical as there are variable elements in both our tme and our other operating expenses line items we had no adjustments to our noncompensation expenses for this quarter and we continue to target an adjusted noncompensation ratio of between  and  relating to our adjusted other income and expenses line item we experienced a slight gain as a result of an improvement in the financial results of our joint ventures lower interest expense as a result of the extinguishment of the orix note and higher interest income on cash balances we had one adjustment in our other income and expenses line item related to a  million gain due to the reduction of an earnout liability from a previous acquisition because we believe this gain is oneoff in nature we have reduced our gaap other income and expenses of  million to  as if the gain had not occurred as you know we are subject to the new tax treatment for vesting shares which came into effect in december  for companies starting new fiscal years after that date as a result during the first quarter of each fiscal year our effective tax rate will be affected by the positive and negative difference between the current price of our stock that is vesting and our stock price at the time of granting as a result of the fact that we have several tranches vesting with some of the granted shares at preipo prices we had a  million positive impact on our effective tax provision which lowered our gaap effective tax rate to  in order to more accurately compare our quarterly results and reflect what we believe to be a normalized effective tax rate we have adjusted our gaap effective tax rate as if there was no impact from this new tax treatment this resulted in an adjusted effective tax rate of  for the quarter turning to the balance sheet as of june   we had  million of unrestricted cash and equivalents and investment securities and debt of  million in the first quarter we paid the bulk of our fiscal year  bonuses we paid the final  million on the orix note settled our forward contract with orix related to the secondary offering that we completed in february paid our quarterly dividend and spent  million repurchasing  shares at an average price of  per share as part of our share repurchase program with that i will turn the call over to ashley where she can open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from ann dai with kbw please go ahead ann dai hi good afternoon thanks all first question for you is something from the side deck so you guys talk about wanting to expand by increasing deal size and bringing in bigger deal fees and i guess i am wondering if we are already seeing some evidence of that movement this quarter or if this is more of a longer term initiative that you are talking about and then if you could just give some color on your strategy around that how much bigger are we talking to what extent can you move up and what does that mean for headcount scott beiser sure hi ann this is scott this is something we have been doing for really last decade and plus i think the average deal size almost year after year continues to increase but it’s in ongoing small measures it’s not a new strategy that we are trying to go after different size businesses but as the barium increases as we have more bankers as we penetrate in more different subindustries we continue to find more deal flow and typically the average size of the deal continues to increase year after year so i think the strategy has been ongoing for many years ann dai okay understood also if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline i know you alluded to in your comments but as you guys discussed it’s difficult for us to see sometimes the pipeline from what’s publicly available and obviously you guys surprised on the ma side relative to what we saw for this past quarter so if you could just give us some color on your outlook that would be great scott beiser the outlook as i mentioned in some of my earlier remarks it still looks good we are still bringing in business number of new projects that we have brought in generally and slightly up from where it was a year ago there is some seasonality to our business so you can’t quite look at it quarter by quarter but still the vast majority of our corporate finance deals are private in nature and so when we announced that we have closed the deal we kind of announced that we took it on and closed at the same time and it’s just not the same as some of our other peers will tend to announce the deal but it may not close for quite some time so unfortunately the backlog data that is out there by the public research houses just may not always be a good indication of really where our business flow is but right now it’s continued to stay strong and steady and growing lindsey alley and as a reminder certainly the majority of the transactions that we closed are privately held and often not announced until closed and very rarely our transaction values amounts to our transaction so very hard to use some of the information sources to predict revenue in a certain quarter prior to those transactions actually closing and even in that case we have more than a handful of transactions that closed that are not announced and that’s just the nature of our clients ann dai understood thank you both scott beiser thanks ann operator and we’ll take our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan hey great how are you guys scott beiser hi devin devin ryan just a couple here maybe first restructuring just wanted to get into the comments a little bit so it sounds like we are above that  million base but maybe south of the  million pace we have  million plus pace from last year so just trying to think about some of the moving parts of deals that are closing versus new deals that are coming in and some of the themes and what it would take to get back to kind of above where we were last year scott beiser so the trends that we are seeing in restructuring and pretty much what we have said over the last probably couple of quarters we still have a decent amount of oil and gas related work that we are finishing off but we are probably coming closer to the end of that and therefore we have said we see that our oil and gas energyrelated restructuring revenues will be declining in the foreseeable future relative to what we had in the last couple of quarters or the last couple of years on the positive side we are seeing a broadening both in industries and geographies in terms of where we are finding new opportunities to get hired and kind of your ultimate question on is this a business that does  million  million or some different amount of number some component of it is just very much market driven and if default rates start to increase if we start to see weaknesses in some incremental industries or subsectors we would expect our revenues in this particular area would grow in this business as we said it’s the most volatile we can have some very sizable projects that can close and increase or decrease results much more than what we find in our corporate finance or fas business and it’s a little bit more impacted by where the market default rates are devin ryan got it okay helpful color and then with respect to noncomp expenses i understand the commentary that this quarter was kind of below the range but kind of the  to  range still holds and that can bounce around a bit i mean should we expect some catchup did that kind of remain within that range for the year or was this kind of an unusually low quarter but just on a go forward quarterly basis  to  is probably still just a better way to think about it scott beiser yes i think you can either think of it in terms of  to  or if you take a look at really what we delivered last year we were sort of in that range of  million to  million per quarter our headcount has been relatively flat yearoveryear so our expectation is that we are similar to that range on a quarterly basis i don’t think there is necessarily a catch up next quarter based on this quarter’s results i just think we had an efficient quarter but i think you are back to what we delivered last year on a quarterly basis is kind of the expectation and we may or may have a quarter as efficient as the one we just had but i am certainly not counting on it devin ryan yes got it okay good to see you though so last i want to hear just on the buyback you repurchased  million i am assuming you will be opportunistic with respect to future buybacks but is there from a timing perspective should we think it could be a little more front end weighted just with offsetting stock awards or how should we think about just kind of the timing from here lindsey alley yes i think our strategy is to offset the amount of the deferred stock that we provide to employees each year what quarters we do that in i think is going to be driven by sort of opportunistic repurchases so we don’t have a strategy that says we really want to accomplish all of this in the first half of the year i think we are going to look at the market and look how we are performing and make those acquisitions accordingly but i do think by the end of the year certainly our goal is to also have dilution and could happen in the first quarter could happen sporadically throughout the year devin ryan got it okay thanks very much operator we’ll take our next question from conor fitzgerald with goldman sachs conor fitzgerald good afternoon scott thanks for your comments on the conversations you are having with clients just trying to kind of more fully understand some of your comments around the challenged earnings growth and how that’s coupled with relatively high valuations and thinking through how that may play out just wondering if you think this results maybe a step back in ma activity in particular on sponsorship side or do you think management teams turn to ma as a solution to grow their earnings scott beiser i think my comments are generally speaking for most of the executives we are talking to they still feel optimistic about their business they still think that earnings will grow on a goforward basis i think their comments are – and this has probably been going on for several years it’s getting harder and harder to continue to grow or grow at a particular growth rate just as the absolute earnings increase i think that tends to sometimes encourage people to do ma activity to try to bolster growth so we don’t see anything regarding their profile or performance that’s impacting the ma activity and then the comment is we are just seeing – people are looking at stock prices at the us across the globe and it’s been a good run for really last probably year plus and so some people that’s encouraging them to maybe do more deals some maybe are less encouraged but in totality we just don’t see any abatement in people’s interest and actual activity in doing ma activity conor fitzgerald thank you that’s helpful and then you had a pretty active quarter on the hiring front just wondering if you could kind of classify the hiring environment today versus a year ago and was kind of this quarter more of a i guess a perfect storm kind of on the hiring front or you think some of the dividends that you talked about when you went public in terms of an improved brand are starting to come through scott beiser i think we have been pretty consistent throughout the timeline since we went public in terms of hiring people sometimes it changes a little if we made acquisitions and it adjust absorbs management’s time but we hired a handful of people this last quarter there is a couple already where offers are out they just haven’t started yet and we typically don’t announce until they do start so our pipeline in terms of people that we are looking to hire and where we are i think is a very consistent and we are looking for people with unique skillsets and some industries or some products or possibly geographies to both expand our capabilities and build the depth of the bench that we have and so far i think we have been very successful in it and yes being public and having been successful over the last many decades financially and otherwise has i think encouraged people to want to join houlihan lokey and that’s been helpful conor fitzgerald thanks for taking my questions scott beiser thanks conor operator operator instructions we’ll take our next question from mike needham with bank of americamerrill lynch please go ahead mike needham hi good afternoon guys hey so just first on growth areas outside of the traditional business like the attritional ma advisory or restructuring like clearly maybe acquisition or the team coming in for intellectual property in fas it looks like you are growing that business pretty quickly maybe if you could drill down on that business the demand from your clients how you think the firm is positioned in that area and then on the horizon where else are you looking to expand scott beiser so on the intellectual property side i mean it’s a unique asset class and we are doing not only work on the valuation side but there are businesses where we are at times representing to sell those intellectual assets sometimes it’s procuring financing against them sometimes it comes up in a restructuring so we think it’s something that works in all of our different product lines and it’s just a different kind of a asset that is not otherwise traditional cash flow type of asset so we think it’s something what has been growing before we bought it and has continued to do well and we think it will expand in our platform and i think there is always areas that we are looking at to continue to grow they can be ancillary type items much like when we bought the intellectual property business or a management consulting business we have continued to tell people we always look at the fund placement business we look at a variety of industries that we still don’t think we are as strong as we would like where we can make acquisitions we are in two dozen or so of different locations there are other locations across the globe that we can continue to grow into i think the key point to us is we always try to be disciplined about what we will either hire or acquire or grow into you can’t be an expert in every single area and we look where we can differentiate ourselves in terms of all of our growth strategies but at this point i think there is still plenty more opportunities we can grow into relative to the market size so opportunities is not our issue i think it’s you just need to be patient and disciplined in finding the right situations to get into it mike needham okay that makes sense just one more on the topic just curious how new people have been performing be it recent hires promotions the last couple of acquisitions you have done i know it’s a hard thing to track because the environment drives a lot of it but just on the organic kind of growth component of the firm how that’s progressing versus the last couple of years scott beiser so the litmus test is our financial results are better today than a couple of years ago with net essentially the same headcount so therefore it says there are whole bunch of reasons things are working but i think with any promotions or hirings or acquisitions there are some people who don’t do as well as we hope and some people do much better than we hope and some kind as we expect and i think we are getting better all the time in trying to screen for those things and find the right attributes but like i said i think the litmus test is kind of looking at our results which is revenues by headcount whether it’s total headcount total mds or whatever measure you want to look at it’s better today than it was a year or two years ago mike needham got it if i could just ask one more followup on the restructuring questions if your oil price stays low could that cause any incremental restructuring in that area or is it the things that we have gotten done already working their way through resolution scott beiser so i think we would describe it as there are certain people who put together business plans at different make it simple oil prices and they put together their business plans and a capital structure that could have happened longer term amortization schedules and some hedge shorter amortization schedules so there are still businesses that put together a business plan at prices well above where oil is today they just had a longer timeframe to make it work out but eventually that time will disappear and if oil and gas prices don’t increase there will likely still be some incremental restructurings to go we just don’t see it at least as of today it’s not going to be at the same level or a wave that started probably two years ago mike needham got it okay thank you operator we’ll take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken hi good afternoon thanks for taking the questions i just wanted to followup on the point that you made scott earlier on geographic and industrial expansion for the restructuring business i appreciate it is hard to try to forecast that but could you maybe give us a sense of some of the specific areas and businesses that you think could present interesting opportunities for this business for you scott beiser so on the geographical side i think we have done restructurings now in several dozen countries all over the globe so we effectively have and will continue to follow people who are making investments andor the distressed debt players and that just continues to grow year by year so our business which used to be almost exclusively us maybe a decade or two ago has gone very much international and we will continue to go international and then we do find in any given time there are certain industries and if it was a couple years ago it was oil and gas obviously right now there is some distress going on in the retail sector and then it feels like it will be for quite so many years and there is just always a subset business as they put together the wrong business plan maybe they have the wrong management team maybe they have gotten hit with certain litigation they have the wrong capital structure just missteps that there is always a certain subset of businesses regardless of how healthy the economy is that are just going to not perform as well and that’s what we have found even this lower default environment where we still continue to have i think pretty good restructuring revenues and how and when it can get up to new record highs the potential is there there is a lot more highyield debt out today than there was before and the default rates are still pretty low and as we all know things will cycle but those are some of the things that we look at in growing both geographically and looking for unique industries or unique issues going on with management or other kinds of business plans that you start working brennan hawken that’s fair thanks for that i noticed that the segment profitability actually declined yearonyear despite lower md headcount and higher revenue was there something specific i know the commentary you said that it was due to the comp ratio moving up but could you help us understand why that would be if the md headcount is going up scott beiser and is your question specific to restructuring brennan hawken yes scott beiser go ahead lindsey lindsey alley okay so brennan i think what we do when we allude to it in the footnotes that we include in the earnings release and in our qs is we always track our revenues according to the product line so if it is a financing it is included in our corporate finance business if it’s a restructuring assignment it’s included in restructuring regardless of who works on the transaction we had a large fee transaction this quarter that was essentially executed by a combination of financial restructuring employees and corporate finance employees and as a result that fee which happened to be of financing showed up  from a revenue standpoint and our corporate finance business but the compensation that will be paid to employees as a result of that fee was split between corporate finance and financial restructuring and the compensation generally follows this segment so you will see relatively higher compensation expenses in financial restructuring and relatively lower compensation expenses in corporate finance which happens to have  on the fees and so you will see that dynamic in our business through the years and through the quarters it was a little more pronounced this quarter because of the size of the mandate brennan hawken that’s fair thank you for that and then last one from me you guys made reference to the fact that slower policy movement on the tax front could end up holding back you haven’t seen it holdback transactions yet but the expectation isn’t that easily could happen is that as a result – or is that expectation as a result of specific conversations that you are having with some of the clients is that mostly in the midmarket deal marketplace for ma or is that just based on your experience on related activity levels scott beiser i think the comment regarding tax policy isn’t necessarily what impact it may have per se on ma activity so we are not hearing people saying i am purposely trying to accelerate a transaction or hold off on a transaction it’s more a commentary than i think most people whether their business owners whether they are investors financiers all expected to believe that there would be some kind of a tax reform all which would point to lower taxes to some extent and therefore that – therefore going to increase people’s earnings and therefore people’s valuations obviously we have not had any tax reform yet whether we will or when it will be just an issue i think that it is in the back of certain people’s minds which is at what point if we don’t get a change in tax policy will the stock market take a different view on what assets and businesses might be worth and it could – in certain cases they are going to be positive or negative to people but just we have been   months since all of this came up and so far we have no tax reform or changes in tax policy but the administration is still talking about it brennan hawken yes okay now i completely appreciate the comments thanks so much for clarifying scott beiser you bet operator and it appears there are no further questions i would like to turn the conference back over to scott beiser for any additional or closing remarks scott beiser i want to thank you all for participating in our first quarter call and we look forward to updating everyone on our progress when we discuss our second quarter results for fiscal  in the fall with that thank you everyone operator and once again that concludes today’s presentation we thank you all for your participation and you may now
