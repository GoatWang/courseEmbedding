liquid x developed a metallic conductive ink technology that allows the printing of metal traces and films onto a number of applications including medical devices consumer electronics and solar panels last november the young company introduced two particlefree inks enabling manufacturers to produce thinner more costeffective and adaptable electronic components its an interesting technology and were on the cutting edge of printed electronics babe said at this point the industry is limited more by the imagination of the designer and by really reliable products the ink we manufacture can make all of this work and its going to be an exciting space over the next decade babe became president and ceo at liquid x in  a year after retiring from bayer where he had built a threedecadelong career he said the excitement of being at a startup and the growth potential of the industry sector attracted him to the company he said ink technology is probably a  billion industry today but could grow to  billion in the next decade the market is in its infancy so the areas we believe our technology can be used most effectively are in nextgeneration solar panels and in wearables — fitbits and sensors that go into clothing or shoes babe said it could be wearable medical devices still its a change for the longtime corporate veteran i went to six employees from  he said babe said liquid x could hire

upload a photo to posterjack the very first thing we do is take a look at your image resolution compare it with your chosen print size and then provide you with a quality score which can be seen immediately after uploading your photo this free image quality check only takes seconds but ensures you’ll be happy with your poster print – no more secondguessing as to whether or not your photo is suitable for printing in a large format if your quality score isn’t as high as you would like it to be you can try switching to a smaller print size if your quality score is unsuitable you will not be able to proceed through the checkout process as print results will not meet our high standards and will be considered unacceptable in this case please choose either a smaller print size or a photo with a higher resolution please feel free to contact customer support for additional help what type of file should i upload we process the four most common image types all digital cameras and graphic design programs will produce at least one of these file types the types we accept are jpeg tiff bmp  png our preferred file type is jpeg which produces excellent print results and efficient file sizes if your image is in a different format please save it as one of the above formats before submitting to us if you arent a big color geek dont worry your camera produces images in a color space we can handle typically srgb if you prefer you can also upload images in adobe rgb or any other popular rgb color profile please do not upload images in the cmyk color space how large of a file can i upload you can upload files up to  mb in size should your images be larger than  mb the best place to start would be checking they are saved in jpeg format tiffs generally produce larger file sizes at no real advantage for print quality if you need further assistance with file sizing please contact us for details your print sizes are listed under aspect ratio categories what is an “aspect ratio” the “aspect ratio” of a photo in its simplest terms refers to the rectangle size of the image photos can be taken as long panoramic rectangles shorter rectangles squares and anything in between the “aspect ratio” measurement is a technical way of expressing the exact rectangle size for a photo or image this is expressed as the relative length of the long edge of the image compared to the short edge here is an infographic to help explain customer service help center contact us tools art shop shipping shipping info production info legal terms  conditions privacy policy connect facebook google
