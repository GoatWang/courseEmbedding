gatewood and the feddersens as part of the school of mechanical engineerings 8 million campaign which includes  million for two major building projects  a  million wing and renovations to ray w herrick laboratories all but  million of the money for construction and renovation will come from private gifts gatewood said the gift will help draw attention to the accomplishments of internationally known faculty who have made important contributions to the field the facility can serve as a reminder of the strength and innovation of mechanical engineering at purdue helping to attract worldclass students and faculty members donald w feddersen gatewood who gave  million   million outright and  million in an estate received his bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from purdue in  a resident of st petersburg fla gatewood is president of westfield usa a homebuilding company the new squarefoot mechanical engineering wing will support the fullscale implementation of a number of innovative learning models developed by the faculty as well as accommodate emerging research programs said e daniel hirleman the william e and florence e perry head of school of mechanical engineering catherine c feddersen for more than a century the purdue school of mechanical engineering has been an international leader in curriculum advances for example in control theory experiential or labbased learning communications design and teambased engineering hirleman said the new wing will enable the next wave of educational innovations in our multiscale manufacturing center students will become as wellversed in microfabrication and eventually nanofabrication as they are with the traditional largescale manufacturing processes of today in the product engineering and realization lab students will be immersed in a microcosm of the product life cycle a centerpiece collaborative classroom will support peertopeer and teamenhanced learning issam mudawar download photo  caption below the new wing as well as major renovations to the ray w herrick laboratories also will increase the research space much of that space will accommodate an emphasis on the schools of engineerings research signature areas including advanced manufacturing nanotechnology perception technologies and tissue and cellular engineering hirleman said those research facilities also will include laboratories with an emphasis on biomechanical engineering and product informatics  the application of information technology to the product life cycle the feddersens  million gift is unrestricted to mechanical engineering and will be used for the most pressing strategic needs of the school including facilities faculty support and student scholarships and fellowships hirleman said our purdue educations have helped each alumnus advance professionally by giving back we can ensure that future students have the same type of success said donald feddersen who received his bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from purdue in  and chairs the mechanical engineering campaign steering committee catherine and i think its so important for alumni to stay connected with their alma maters and we are happy to be able to help purdue donald feddersen a pioneer in computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing tools works with a number of hightech companies catherine feddersen is a graduate of wellesley college and is owner and managing director of burke capital an investment management firm linda pb katehi purdues john a edwardson dean of engineering said the gifts for the school of mechanical engineering will help the school grow as it continues to change with the field we will add  faculty positions in mechanical engineering during the next few years in areas such as advanced manufacturing energy and propulsion and nanotechnology katehi said the new facilities will allow us to merge research in modern emerging technologies with modern teaching methods that the current space simply cannot accommodate   patrick wang patrick wang wangs gift will support the school of electrical and computer engineerings 8 million campaign which includes professorships scholarships and programs as well as a proposal to build a new discovery facility and to remodel space in the electrical engineering building and the materials and electrical engineering building the new building which would likely be a part of the universitys discovery park would be dedicated to research in areas such as computer engineering computer vision robotics and artificial intelligence although still in the planning stage the building would add more than  square feet of space to the school electrical and computer engineering facilities are an important priority for the university katehi said undergraduate enrollment in the school has increased  percent in the past decade and research expenditures have doubled at the same time space allocated to the schools teaching and research programs is approximately half that of its peers the school of electrical and computer engineering also will renovate both the electrical engineering building and the space in the materials and electrical engineering building that it will take over when the school of materials engineering moves into the new millennium building those renovations will increase the space dedicated to students including a resource room where they can receive help in communication skills purdues school of electrical and computer engineering is one of the best not only in the united states but in the world wang said i hope this gift can help to encourage more international involvement with the university people throughout the world enjoy the benefits of the education and research being done at the school wang received both a bachelors and masters degree electrical engineering from purdue in  a resident of hong kong wang serves as the chairman and ceo of johnson electric the worlds largest manufacturer of the types of small motors used to power equipment such as hair dryers electric toothbrushes and electric car windows   gift for visual and performing arts building the anonymous donor

elmores gift of  million will help pay for the william and mary jane elmore advanced concept validation center a laboratory that will be built in the birck nanotechnology center the center laboratory will be used to help transition the technology developed in the nanotechnology center to marketable products and processes mary jane elmore the birck nanotechnology center is one of five major centers planned for phase i of purdues discovery park a stateoftheart interdisciplinary teaching and research complex other facilities include the bindley bioscience center burton d morgan center for entrepreneurship an eenterprise center and the discovery learning center nanotechnology focuses on building minute devices and systems atom by atom its applications potentially will affect business medical treatment communication and other fields in everything from supersmall computers spacecraft and microscopic machines to tiny lifesaving medical devices and new materials the building will include flexible laboratory space that can be shifted and changed to accommodate various interdisciplinary research projects one of the centers other features will be the placement of chemical and biological processing labs adjacent to and within facilities typically used to make computer microchips easing collaboration among researchers in different types of science nanotechnology is a developing discipline katehi said projections are that the united states will need  million engineers and scientists in the next  years and many of them will be in emerging areas like nanotechnology william elmore said that he and his wife both encounter purdue graduates in their professional lives and these graduates continue to be some of the most innovative researchers and entrepreneurs working in hightech fields from our work in venture capital both mary jane and i know importance of the link between research and commercial endeavors elmore said the research that will be done at the birck nanotechnology center will be the base of new companies that will change all of our lives william elmore received bachelors and masters degrees in electrical engineering from purdue in  and  respectively and mary jane elmore graduated from purdue in  with a bachelors degree in mathematics now living in palo alto calif both work in venture capital william is a cofounder and general partner
