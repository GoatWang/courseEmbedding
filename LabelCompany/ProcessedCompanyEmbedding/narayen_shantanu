platforms — including flash pdf and the forthcoming apollo — as the foundation for the next generation of interactive webenabled applications the company with the most to lose if adobe succeeds is microsoft although microsoft’s operating systems productivity applications and server products still generate a significant majority of its revenue as microsoft chief software architect ray ozzie recently discussed with knowledgewharton the future is in software built around webconnected services and ozzie even noted that adobe’s strategy in this arena “is basically the same as microsoft’s” microsoft’s recent product announcements underscore the increasing competition between the two companies microsoft’s expression studio includes design illustration and web development tools that target adobe’s strongest market — creative professionals and on april   microsoft squared off against adobe’s flash platform when it officially unveiled silverlight previously known as “windows presentation foundation everywhere” a web browser plugin to deliver rich webbased applications and video to windows and macintosh users this past week sun microsystems an early contender with its java language entered the fray by announcing javafx a forthcoming scripting language with apparent similarities to microsoft’s silverlight and adobe’s flash along with ceo bruce chizen much of the responsibility for addressing these challenges falls to adobe president and chief operating officer shantanu narayen narayen grew up in hyderabad the younger of two brothers and moved to the us in  to pursue a master’s degree in computer science at bowling green state university in ohio where he met his wife after graduation narayen and his wife moved to silicon valley where he landed a position at apple by studying nights while working at apple narayen earned an mba from the haas school of business uc berkeley in  following apple narayen did a stint at silicon graphics and then founded pictra an early entrant into the field of online digital photo sharing narayen joined adobe systems in  and was appointed president and chief operating officer in january  in the first of a twopart interview with knowledgewharton narayen discusses the details behind the company’s recent product announcements an edited version of that conversation follows in the second part published in india knowledgewharton narayen talks about how india is key to the company’s global growth strategy knowledgewharton adobe introduced creative suite  on march  reportedly the largest software launch in adobe’s history how has the response been thus far narayen we’ve started shipping some editions of creative suite  and the response from our customers has been very positive it’s a massive step forward in a creative professional’s ability to deliver content across print web video and wireless i think people were blown away by the amount of indepth integration and workflow that we were able to provide so quickly after coming together with macromedia we’re very pleased knowledgewharton  while the official unveiling was on march  the launch date was well known in advance some companies like apple are obsessive about secrecy until a product is officially announced other companies promote their plans well in advance how do you determine when you’re going to get the word out about a new product narayen  one of the clear trends we are seeing is that it behooves us to involve the community in the development of the next generation of applications being transparent about our plans enables us to get better feedback so that we can deliver better solutions to our customerswith apollo we’re targeting the developer community and with lightroom we did a public beta very early in the process to get customers to try the software and give us feedback lightroom is a much better product as a result with our labs site we will continue to put things out there to get customer feedback to help us deliver better products having said that we also recognize that when we preannounce products sometimes people tend to stall their purchases because they’re aware there’s a new product coming out so there has to be a balance    in retrospect maybe announcing something nine months ahead of schedule — like when we said creative suite is going to ship in the second quarter — might have been a little premature but right now the buzz is there in the industry people are trying to rally around when they can build their ecosystem of products at our launch we’re trying to be better partners with people who need that information to do a great job knowledgewharton  the first two products you named were new “” products where there seems to be no disadvantage to announcing early is the strategy different in the case of a product like creative suite where there is a previous version that customers can purchase narayen  we look at it on a casebycase basis with photoshop cs we put out a public beta because people were transitioning from the power pc to the mactel architecture and we wanted to make sure that we got it right these products are getting more complex so it’s always this balance between secrecy and getting a bigger bang for what we do knowledgewharton you recently announced plans to open source the flex sdk exactly what is adobe doing and why narayen open standards have always been a core part of how we’ve tried to deliver technology platforms — whether it was with postscript pdf or our recent announcement of opensourcing the flash actionscript virtual machine working with the mozilla foundation’s “tamarin” project specifically as it relates to flex as we work more on enabling rich internet applications for the web and new apollo applications for the desktop we want more developers to participate in the growth of this framework by providing the flex sdk as open source under the mozilla public license we believe this will enable more developers to help contribute one of the key initiatives under web  is about involving the community in moving the entire industry forward we think this will help developers overcome any objections they might have knowledgewharton while this may be good for developers how does it help adobe’s shareholders narayen we will also continue to deliver products with flash and flex on the desktop and with server products take the analogy of acrobat pdf has always been an open specification and we found a way to monetize it both with acrobat on the desktop as well as increasingly with livecycle on the server side for enterprises using flex to deliver rich internet applications enables our customers to do enterprisewide data services which will be an opportunity for us we also think that apollo is an opportunity for us to build brand new applications the adobe media player which was one of the other announcements we made is a new desktop application built on top of apollo we will be able to monetize the media player by enabling companies that want to deliver content for commerce through our server drm digital rights management offering so we believe we have multiple monetization opportunities   knowledgewharton you mentioned the announcement of adobe media player flash already plays a significant role in delivering video over the web what will the adobe media player add narayen first as you point out flash video as been proliferating on the web and we’ve been very pleased with that in talking to customers we’ve found that they would like the ability to have the flash video player offline as well as online today flash video works within the browser with content streamed from servers anywhere over the internet but you might think about movie download services that want to use flash video to deliver movies to a desktop with the ability to play offline consumers may have a number of flash video files on their desktop and the media player will allow them to manage those second as we start to look at offline we want to help our customers monetize this media the media player will also have the ability to do digital rights management for this content so for content publishers it provides new abilities to distribute and track media for consumers it allows them to have a far more compelling experience with all their media assets offline we’re also looking at how we make sure that flash video works all the way from the desktop to mobile devices and extending to hd high definition quality the adobe media player is really the next logical step of that entire video publishing workflow allowing flash video to be a more compelling format knowledgewharton as you’ve said the media player will add drm capabilities to flash video will the same drm features then be added to the flash browser plugin narayen we’re certainly evaluating that we’re talking to a number of our customers about how they would like us to deploy the media player online as well as offline phase one is — let’s make sure the adobe media player allows our content publisher partners to provide these capabilities clearly the media player will be crossplatform which continues to be one of the core tenets of adobe knowledgewharton  you mentioned adobe’s forthcoming apollo platform macromedia had a product called central which had some of the characteristics of apollo but it never really caught on why will apollo be different narayen  when we were separate companies both macromedia and adobe independently recognized that the web as it exists today has some very significant limitations in terms of the user experience we’re trying to overcome those deficiencies as you point out macromedia had a project called central adobe was working on its own product code named metro later called tahoe we recognized that if people can harness the power of the desktop and yet have the connectivity of the internet with a compelling rich experience there are new applications one can build both companies shared that vision even as we were talking about combining the two companies in conversations with kevin lynch it was clear that we shared that common visionthere are a couple of reasons why we think apollo will be different one is that today we’re leveraging the power not just of flash but also of pdf and html which is a significant difference in strategy second we’ve been able to get a common scripting language that we believe will enable people to extend these applicationsthird is the developer community for example on the pdf side we’ve been getting more developers to adopt pdf and now we’re making it an open standard similarly flex and flex builder have been gaining developer support i think we’ve just evolved and sometimes the timing has to be right some things are just ahead of their time knowledgewharton microsoft has officially announced silverlight which appears to have a number of characteristics of the flash platform you’ve competed with microsoft in the past but to many observers it seems like a new headtohead battle is brewing how do you view microsoft as a competitor in this rich internet application space narayen first and foremost it’s a validation of what we’ve been talking about it’s pleasing in the sense that people are seeing what macromedia was talking about with respect to rich internet applications and what we’ve been saying about providing compelling experiences and combining the power of desktop and connectivity of the web it’s good to see all the industry validation specifically in regard to microsoft i would say first that we’ve been in this business for a while flash player is installed on approximately  of internetenabled desktops flash has been driving the web video revolution for some time we’re clearly the incumbent a characteristic that distinguishes adobe’s strategy from every other company is our strong belief in crossplatform as a core tenet — not just crossplatform across mac windows and linux but also increasingly across nonpc devices with flash lite and flashcast we’ve been focused on mobile services for quite a while adobe has demonstrated its commitment to cross platform development visàvis apple platforms as well as windows and alternate devices macromedia had done the same thing i think it’s a huge market opportunity we have to continue to leverage our core strengths which are first of all the authoring environment let’s not underestimate the fact that all this content is being authored in our applications plus we have this crossplatform playback software that is already ubiquitous and we’re pushing the envelope with the media player and apollo so we’re not standing still but the fact that it’s a huge market opportunity will attract other competitors including microsoft we believe that the user experience is what’s going to distinguish this next generation of applications we welcome other companies to participate in this revolution we like our ability to succeed given some of the fundamental tenets that we believe in knowledgewharton it also appears that sun microsystems is moving into this space as well with their recent announcement of javafx will all this competition help the market or will the fragmentation that could result stall the market wouldn’t we be better off if there were one standard platform for rias narayen i think choice for customers is always good from our perspective the more we can have things be built on top of standards the better it is and our apollo vision has always been about leveraging existing standards — the flash standard the pdf standard but also html because we believe that’s one of the existing standards out there from a scripting perspective we are looking to standardize scripting across all these platforms with what we are doing with ecmascript and opensourcing the virtual machine through the mozilla foundation it’s great to see the innovation that’s happening it’s good for the industry but i think we will have multiple standards i don’t see a scenario in which everybody coalesces around one standard that’s been representative of the computing industry since its inception so i don’t think it’s going to change anytime soon knowledgewharton as you’ve said one thing that makes flash attractive as a platform is the broad distribution of the player developers can count on it “just being there” however flash is no longer included with microsoft’s internet explorer  it doesn’t come bundled with firefox how big a concern is this and related to this how are you going to get the runtime environment required to execute apollo applications distributed broadly narayen first we’re superthrilled with the adoption of flash  across computing desktops around the world the adoption has been incredible because it’s such a seamless update experience and the fact that people are moving to new flash content enables us to really quickly get flash  out there with respect to apollo there are two things one is that we have our own vehicles to enable our customers to get the distribution they want for apollo but in addition to that we expect that the new generation of apollo applications that will be created will also spur people to get apollo on their desktops if you get the adobe media player you get apollo with it there are a number of thirdparty developers who are also building some very compelling applications all of which will help us distribute the apollo runtime knowledgewharton  you’ve mentioned standards a couple of times through aiim the association for information and image management you recently submitted the pdf specification for approval as an iso international standards organization standard what drove that you already have versions of pdf like the archival version pdfa as published standards what motivated moving the full pdf spec to standardization narayen  it was really the next step in the strategy pdfx was adopted by the prepress industry many years ago we have pdfa for archival pdfh in healthcare and pdfe in engineering it became increasingly clear that there would be significant merit to doing that for all of pdf and as you know pdf has been an open specification from day one so it’s just a continuous move by adobe to involve the community in moving our technologies forward knowledgewharton  but as you pointed out pdf has been documented from the beginning so what’s new here what difference is there in making it an iso standard narayen  one of the pieces of feedback that we got was that by working with standards bodies and making it a formal iso standard more people were willing to participate in the evolution of that standard i think ownership of that standard then becomes something that more people feel passionately about knowledgewharton  but won’t adobe still control the development of pdf narayen  well there are multiple implementations of pdf writers as well as pdf viewers we will continue to innovate around the pdf specification but this welcomes the community to the effort as well knowledgewharton  as you just mentioned there are a number of companies that have software to create pdf files one of them is microsoft which now makes pdf creation available for microsoft office  there was apparently some disagreement about its original plans to include that capability in the product what’s adobe’s stance on that narayen  well first you can’t always believe what you read in the press knowledgewharton  that’s why we’re asking narayen  adobe has always maintained that pdf is an open specification as long as companies support pdf in the original spirit — that is fine with us specifically if companies use monopoly power to further their own interest that’s where we have an issue but we welcome competition on an equal playing field whether it’s autodesk or microsoft there are many companies that support pdf we recognized many years ago that we needed to focus on higher value uses of pdf — things like digital signatures review and mark up redaction collaboration and the ability to embed d objects with acrobat d so what you’ve seen us do is segment the product line we now have acrobat elements which has basic pdf creation but we find that our customers are increasingly moving to the higherend products — whether it’s acrobat standard or acrobat professional or now acrobat d our focus moving forward is how do we continue to build enduser value based on pdf as a standard knowledgewharton  just so it’s clear — we had originally heard that microsoft planned to include pdf creation with office  it’s now available for free as a separate download it sounds like you would have been okay with microsoft including it in the product as long as the pdf standard was respected in terms of the way it’s documented narayen  we have responded rather than initiated when regulatory bodies have asked us questions about microsoft’s support for pdf it is our belief that as long as people compete with us on a level playing field we welcome any competition knowledgewharton  don’t many people buy acrobat principally to create pdf as pdf creation becomes more ubiquitous — whether in the apple operating system microsoft products or other tools — isn’t this a challenge in terms of your revenue stream narayen  a couple of things first we are seeing acrobat professional as the product that’s driving a fairly significant portion of our revenue acrobat professional has a number of features beyond pdf creation such as the ability to create and fill out forms and do more collaboration so we’re increasingly seeing people adopt the higher value uses of pdf acrobat elements which is the product that does just basic pdf creation is actually the smallest portion of our acrobat revenuewhile we continue to increase the core value of pdf across horizontal usage we’re also making sure we understand vertical workflows and deliver higher value usage to those customers knowledgewharton  do you see that growth coming rapidly enough to offset any decline in revenue from people who previously bought the product for pdf creation narayen  the revenue for acrobat continues to do well there are approximately  million knowledge workers who represent the available market opportunity for acrobat the revenue for acrobat today is driven a lot by new units rather than upgrades the business is really new customers adopting the pdf platform we believe there’s significant headroom there knowledgewharton  while we’re clearing up fuzzy news stories — there was a published report that adobe has plans to release a hosted ondemand version of photoshop how will this work narayen  whether it is image editing or video editing we want our brand and our technology in front of as many customers as possible we believe software delivery through hosted services is going to become more common you’ve seen that we’ve already done something with video editing in partnership with photobucket we want our imaging brand as well in front of customers beyond that i’m not announcing any products today knowledgewharton  in terms of your current offerings adobe appears to be supporting a number of overlapping products you have dreamweaver along with golive you have both fireworks and illustrator photoshop and imageready is it a challenge to support such a broad spectrum of products many of which have similar or overlapping features narayen  each of the products you’ve mentioned — and there are others such as indesign and framemaker and pagemaker — have a very broad spectrum of customers with features available in certain products that are not available in other products in that genrelet’s take the professional page layout market for example while indesign is the center of focus the features to do large document publishing and xml publishing are more advanced in framemaker so we expect our customers to use framemaker for that purposesimilarly freehand allows the ability to do multiple page composition for vectors that illustrator doesn’t support each of those products has achieved a certain amount of success by having key features that appeal to certain customers clearly photoshop illustrator indesign and dreamweaver appeal to the broadest spectrum of customers and that’s where we’ve put in the most focus but we will continue to support all those other products knowledgewharton  so you see these products having a niche of their own rather than consolidating them by adding the good features of the others onto the core product narayen  we will continue to extend the capabilities of the core product in each of those segments with some of the features that are available in the other products but yes it is our goal to continue to make sure that we don’t leave any customer behind for a number of customers who have adopted a product like framemaker we will continue to invest in it knowledgewharton  in discussing adobe’s india strategy you emphasized the importance of the mobile space in the us at least it appears that jme java applets are more common on cell phones than flash have you found it challenging to get your mobile platforms onto handsets in the us narayen  our core strategy in the mobile space is first to make sure we have the flash user environment available on as broad a set of handsets as possible flash is being used for a couple of different purposes on those devices today — to browse the web and to create a compelling new user experience increasingly it will be used to deliver services with a tvlike metaphor or a channel metaphor on these particular devicesthe good news is that we have relationships with most of the major handset manufacturers as you see new handsets being introduced into the us i think you will see the volume of flashenabled handsets increase yearin and yearout we just announced at the gsm conference that we have over  million alternate devices that are now shipping with flash a lot of that was driven initially by japan but now over  of that volume is being driven outside japan you are seeing the new generation of phones shipping with flashi think apple’s entry into the market with iphone is only going to enhance the importance of the user experience on handsets across the spectrum which plays to our strengths our strategy is make sure we get relationships with all the major handset manufacturers which we have as the new phones enter into the us you will see them being flashenabled and we’re working with the operators we’re now working with verizon and qualcomm to make sure content that’s being downloaded through the brew binary runtime environment for wireless network also has the ability to download flash contentwe’re also working with operators — whether it’s telenor in the nordics or docomo in japan — to offer new innovative flashcast services as you see these flashcast services also enter the us you will see more handsets where it’s obvious that they are being driven through flash it’s early i would say the us in general was probably a few years behind in terms of the telecom revolution so stay tuned there are some exciting developments coming up knowledgewharton  what is the future of pdf on mobile devices you have pdf readers for the palm and pocket pc platform but we haven’t seen new developments in that space for some time is that because you see flash as a more significant growth opportunity there narayen  there are customers who will require both for example as the settop box becomes more a part of the living room to do things like browse the web we believe that represents a great opportunity for pdf support pdf on alternative devices is central to our strategy some are devices that we port ourselves for others we partner with people by providing them an sdk software development kit and working with them to port the pdf reader to their environment you’ll see more instances of both of those applications over the next year knowledgewharton  in discussing india you also mentioned that adobe is now selling into the enterprise space you’ve been doing this for several years now how pleased are you with the progress that you’ve made narayen  we’re pleased more and more customers are starting to see the benefit of automating inefficient manual processes we have been focused primarily on regulated industries because the amount of paper used in regulated industries is large whether it’s financial services government or manufacturing we now have customers who have seen significant roi using our solutionswhat’s exciting moving forward is that we intend to combine our flex technology so that we can offer the cio a more complete solution by having an immersive experience on the web as well as automating their workflow and having a statement of record the core strategy in the enterprise space is to bring together people information and processes a combination of livecycle and flex allows you to do that the enterprise is now approximately a  million business for adobe it’s a meaningful revenue stream knowledgewharton we’ve talked about apollo quite a bit — what’s your vision for it if apollo is successful what will people be able to do that they can’t do now narayen i think we’ll witness a new generation of applications that people haven’t even imagined yet because we will spur creativity among developers you’ll have the power of the internet combined with the desktop to deliver new engaging experiences with which people can manage all the information and media assets they have we’re excited about apollo and new applications like the adobe media player what’s really cool is when you see other companies build applications based on apollo — whether it’s the compelling new application ebay is working on that significantly increases the user experience of doing auctions on the internet or buzzword by virtual ubiquity that shows you how you can have something as common as word processing done very differently if that drives the imagination of other developers to build cool new applications that you and i have not even imagined that’s when apollo will really be a success stay tuned it’s going to be exciting supports kws technology content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
