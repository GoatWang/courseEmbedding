of gaap to nongaap measuresunaudited in thousandsuse of nongaap financial measuresthis press release includes the nongaap financial measures of revenue in constant currency adjusted gross profit and adjusted ebitdathe company presents these nongaap measures because it believes these measures are useful indicators of the company’s operating performance  management uses these nongaap measures principally as a measure of the companys operating performance and believes that these measures are useful to investors because they are frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the company’s industry  the company also believes that these measures are useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to periodconstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodtoperiod  we calculate constant currency by converting the prioryear results using currentyear foreign currency exchange ratesadjusted gross profit represents gross profit less amortization expense of surgical instruments  the company presented adjusted gross profit because it believes it is a useful measure of the companys gross profit and operating performance because the measure is not burdened by the timing impact of instrument purchases and related amortization adjusted ebitda represents net loss plus interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense and foreign currency transaction loss gainthe company presents adjusted ebitda because it believes it is a useful indicator of the company’s operating performance  management uses adjusted ebitda principally as a measure of the company’s operating performance and for planning purposes including the preparation of the company’s annual operating budget and financial projections adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap and it should not be construed as an inference that the company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items  in addition adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments debt service requirements capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future  adjusted ebitda contains certain other limitations including the failure to reflect the company’s cash expenditures cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized  in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future the company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation  the company’s presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed to imply that the company’s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments  management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on its gaap results in addition to using adjusted ebitda supplementally  the company’s definition of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculationthe following table presents reconciliations of gross profit to adjusted gross
