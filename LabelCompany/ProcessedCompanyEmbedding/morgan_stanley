reserved morgan stanley debuts fiduciary product for small k plans with eye toward dol rule morgan stanley debuts fiduciary product for small k plans with eye toward dol rule the wirehouse offers a way for nonfiduciary brokers working with k plans to continue working with clients in the smallplan market mar     pm by greg iacurci  zoom morgan stanley wealth management is making a push into the small k marketplace debuting a fiduciary product exclusively available to its advisers and offering a riskcontrolled way to continue servicing those plans when the department of labors fiduciary rule comes into forcethe wirehouse partnered with ascensus a retirement plan record keeper on the product called clearfit available to k plans with less than  million in assetsascensus will perform the plan record keeping and administration while morgan stanley which has an adviser force of more than  will offer a uniform lineup of investments for the k plans and assume a fiduciary role its morgan stanleys first fiduciary product for the small and micro k market and gives the brokerage a level of blanket protection for k business under the dol fiduciary rule which raises investmentadvice standards in retirement accounts this program allows every single one of our advisers … to act in a fiduciary advisory capacity with their clients said eric garofalo the firms executive director of corporate retirement servicesobservers believe the dol rule — which is coming into force april  but which may be delayed at least  days and eventually amended or rescinded — is going to have an outsized effect on advisers servicing small k plans advisers servicing that market are often nonfiduciary brokers whose investment advice would likely become fiduciary in nature under the rule thereby exposing brokerage firms to more risk if they were to continue doing business the same wayhowever with clearfit because the morgan stanley organization takes responsibility for the investment fiduciary functions away from its advisers the firm can mitigate risk while allowing its advisers to maintain or enter into new relationships with smallmarket clientsthe adviser could continue providing services such as nonfiduciary investment educationwhether the regulation moves forward or whether it doesnt the concepts that are a part of that dol regulation were very much considered as the product was built out said kathleen connelly executive vice president of client experience and relationship management at ascensuspreviously only advisers morgan stanley designates as retirement specialists were able to enter into fiduciary advisory contracts with k clients the firm has roughly  designated specialists the remaining advisers engaged plans in a nonfiduciary commissionbased fashionnow those nonspecialists have three options when engaging retirement plan clients said spokesman christine jockle commissionbased business the clearfit advisory approach and a partnership with a retirement specialist who would take on fiduciary responsibilities some of the brokerdealer firms are working with the rule that way to make sure they dont lose the business from the less experienced advisers but at the same time theyre protecting the firm and serving the interest of the client by having someone experienced actually work on the plan said bruce ashton a partner at drinker biddle  reathseveral record keepers offer plans and advisers the capability to outsource investment fiduciary functions to providers such as mesirow financial wilshire associates morningstar investment management and envestnet retirement solutionsmost have been in my experience investment advisory firms and not necessarily a brokerdealer so in that sense morgan stanleys may be a little bit unique mr ashton said of outsourced fiduciary servicestheyre typically used by smallmarket plans because larger plans tend to engage their own fiduciary adviser he addedmorgan stanleys role in its new product will be as a  investment fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of  meaning it will take discretion to add or remove funds and subadvisers from the investment lineupthe menu is comprised of  collective investment trust funds some of which have multiple subadvisers and a targetdate asset allocation model that uses the collective funds on the menu the unweighted investment cost for the fund menu is roughly  ms jockle saidascensus charges a flat dollar fee for record keeping – the base fee which accommodates the first  plan participants is  and theres a perparticipant fee for anyone additional the cost of which is based on plan size theres also an annual benchmarking report delivered by fiduciary benchmarks to the plan adviser on an annual

jaffe published jan    pm et share few pluses in morgan stanleys structured product by chuckjaffe boston marketwatch  the simple explanation sounds great double the markets upside  to about  a year  without any change in the downside its pitched as a way for an investor to get solid returns even in a year when the market is only modestly positive but anything with a name like performance leveraged upside securities plus is not so simple and investors digging deeply into the morgan stanley plus thats tied to the standard  poors  index are likely to come away thinking theyve uncovered a stupid investment of the week stupid investment of the week showcases the conditions and characteristics that make a security less than ideal for the average investor in the hope that spotlighting trouble in one situation will make it easier for the reader to ferret out elsewhere morgan stanleys family of plus securities represent what brokers call structured products part of a growing type of similar offerings pushed under a variety of names by a number of the major investment firms the plus is a form of unsecured note traded on a stock exchange where the return is pegged to the performance of an underlying index the terms and conditions vary so that the plus based on the value of the standard  poors  index is very different from the plus for the amex china index the sp  plus product  traded on the american stock exchange under the ticker symbol spu spu   promises a soupedup bet on a bull market the leveraged upside of this plus is  of the gain of the sp  index over a month period while plus products trade on an exchange they are offered at a specific issue price and tend to be held like notes more than stocks the spu was issued in november of  and matures in march  functionally the spu is a bet on a middling market one where largecap stocks return  to  a bit lower than historical norms if the index gains that much the leverage of the plus should double that amount allowing an investor to produce a doubledigit return in an ordinary year for the market the problems come in execution for starters while the spu turbocharges the markets gains it offers no protection from losses if the index falls prior to maturity so does the value of the note theres also a cost to getting the highpowered upside after the agents commission the investor could pay big because of how the index return is calculated specifically the spu bases its return on the level of the index not its total return thats a complicated way of saying kiss dividends goodbye currently the yield on the sp  is about  own an index fund and you capture those dividends which act as a cushion if the market falls own the plus and the payouts dont factor into your gain or mitigate a loss next there is the cap which restricts your gains issuers of structured products must protect against having to pay the enormous leveraged gains that would occur if the index skyrockets the spu is capped at a maximum index gain of  over the month term double the gain to reflect the leverage and the maximum gain is  over  months window of opportunity simply put theres a small window of index returns where the spu is better than or equal to owning an index fund if you factor in the missed dividends hat window runs from about  to  in every other return scenario a basic sp index fund would be a superior investment eric lewis chief investment officer at bedrock capital in los altos calif suggests that an examination of the spu based on historic returns and standard deviations shows that the product will work out in favor of the investor about one year in four morgan stanley however suggests a higher success rate based on the fact that it structures the notes not on historical returns but on the companys own forecasts contacted for this column the company issued the following statement for an index that has historically over the long term had high singledigit returns the ability to double those returns to a maximum cap in the teens can benefit our clients  particularly in an environment where our expectations for that index are moderate but even morgan stanley insiders and brokers acknowledge that investors can do the same thing on their own without structured notes there are a number of mutual funds and exchangetraded funds which offer a leveraged play on indexes where an investor who feels optimistic about the market can goose returns those funds are built as trading vehicles while the spu  despite being traded on an exchange  is built to be held to maturity a strategy of using an sp  index fund combined with options on the index could also create the doubletheupside situation with the dividends reducing the loss potential many of the plus notes are based on more esoteric index products making them harder to replicate and putting the investors in a position where the product provides a unique strategy for a specific asset class the sp  however is not that kind of hardtoreplicate investment but perhaps the biggest drawback is that the spu is so complicated that the average investor only latches on to the simple explanation without understanding what theyve really bought its a pretty good bet that no investor wakes up in the morning and says i need a performance leveraged upside security today instead relying on what was heard in a sales pitch says lewis for someone who wants to take a position that the market is going to go up and leverage the bet there are a lot of different ways to do it this seems to be a particularly ineffective
