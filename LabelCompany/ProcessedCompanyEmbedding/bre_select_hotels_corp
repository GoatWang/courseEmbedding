regarding unsolicited tender offer by mackenzie capital management for preferred shares march    pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirebre select hotels corp the “company” has recently been informed of an unsolicited tender offer by affiliates of mackenzie capital management lp collectively “mackenzie” to buy up to  shares of the company’s  series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock the “preferred shares” at a price of  per share less any cash distributions made by the company after march   the “mackenzie offer” given that the company currently expects to declare a cash dividend of  per share payable on april   to holders of record of preferred shares on april   the adjusted price of the mackenzie offer is  per share after careful evaluation of the terms of the mackenzie offer neither the company nor the company’s board of directors makes any recommendation and none of them has authorized any person to make any recommendation as to whether the holders of preferred shares should tender or refrain from tendering preferred shares in the mackenzie offer however shareholders should consider the following mackenzie’s adjusted offer price of  per share represents an approximately  discount to the initial liquidation preference of  per preferred share the adjusted offer price is also lower than the  per share price that the company paid for the redemption of  preferred shares on december   the “ redemption” the redemption price in the  redemption equaled the  liquidation preference per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to and including the redemption date although the company may at its option redeem all or a portion of the preferred shares at any time and will under certain circumstances specified in the terms of the preferred shares be required to redeem all of the preferred shares at a redemption price per share equal to the liquidation preference as it may be adjusted from time to time plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends the company does not currently intend to and there can be no assurance that in the future the company will redeem any preferred shares unless it is required to do so under the terms of the preferred

the acquisition of apple six and filed with the sec on april   the initial liquidation preference of  per share is subject to downward adjustment should net costs and payments relating to certain litigation and regulatory legacy matters exceed  million from the date of the merger agreement between apple six bre holdings and the company november   the legacy matters are described under “legal proceedings” on page  of the company’s quarterly report on form q that was filed with the sec on november   as of today the company does not expect that the initial liquidation preference will be adjusted the mackenzie offer is limited to approximately  of the outstanding preferred shares only  shares out of the  outstanding preferred shares mackenzie offers to purchase the  shares on a “firstcome firstbuy” basis based upon the dates on which mackenzie receives completed assignment forms the mackenzie offer therefore coerces holders of preferred shares to tender their shares to mackenzie as soon as possible which could deprive them of adequate time to evaluate the mackenzie offer the coercive nature of the mackenzie offer is exacerbated by the fact that holders of preferred shares will not have withdrawal rights thus shareholders who tender shares to mackenzie will not be able to withdraw their shares if a holder of preferred shares changes his her or its decision to tender during the term of the mackenzie offer whether due to changed circumstances relating to the company or relating to such holder or to other factors such holder will not be able to withdraw tendered shares there is no guarantee that the mackenzie offer will be completed as stated in “terms conditions risks and disclosures” enclosed with the offer letter dated march   mackenzie will be able to rescind its offer if there is a material adverse change in the operations of the company and mackenzie purports to define “material adverse change” as a change that “would likely cause a reasonable shareholder to reconsider the decision to buy or sell shares” holders of preferred shares must make their own decision whether to continue to hold their preferred shares or to tender their preferred shares to mackenzie and if so how many shares to tender upon their own assessment of the value of the preferred shares and taking into account that the preferred shares are not listed on any securities exchange and no public market for the preferred shares exists their liquidity needs and any other factors they deem relevant in doing so holders of preferred shares should read and evaluate carefully the information in the offer materials provided by mackenzie the information about the company in the company’s annual report on form k that was filed with the sec on march   the company’s quarterly report on form q that was filed with the sec on november   and its other filings with the sec and the information about the terms of the preferred shares in the proxy statement neither the company nor the company’s board of directors or management has hired any investment bank or other third party professional to evaluate the fairness of the price offered by mackenzie or the other terms of the mackenzie offer holders of preferred shares should consult with their personal financial advisor or other legal tax or investment professionals regarding their individual circumstances about
