information commissioner oaic released the findings of its investigation into a mailing list error that resulted in approximately  telstra customers personal information being sent to other customers the australian privacy commissioner timothy pilgrim said our investigation has confirmed that while telstra breached the privacy act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties this incident was caused by a oneoff human error it was not a result of telstra failing to have reasonable steps in place to protect the personal information of its customers as required by the privacy actcitation needed the government probe determined that telstra had security measures in place to protect customer personal information involved in mail campaigns these measures included privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses privacy impact assessments and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns in this instance taking into account the range of measures telstra has in place for mail campaigns i consider that the oneoff human error that occurred does not mean that telstra failed to comply with its obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information of its customers therefore i consider that telstra has not breached this particular aspect of the privacy act the privacy commissioner saidcitation needed the commissioner determined that telstra had acted immediately to prevent further breaches notify customers and review its data security practices in the report pilgrim related that the australian government is currently considering recommendations from the australian law reform commission to introduce mandatory data breach notification laws in australia see

information commissioner oaic released the findings of its investigation into a mailing list error that resulted in approximately  telstra customers personal information being sent to other customers the australian privacy commissioner timothy pilgrim said our investigation has confirmed that while telstra breached the privacy act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties this incident was caused by a oneoff human error it was not a result of telstra failing to have reasonable steps in place to protect the personal information of its customers as required by the privacy actcitation needed the government probe determined that telstra had security measures in place to protect customer personal information involved in mail campaigns these measures included privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses privacy impact assessments and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns in this instance taking into account the range of measures telstra has in place for mail campaigns i consider that the oneoff human error that occurred does not mean that telstra failed to comply with its obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information of its customers therefore i consider that telstra has not breached this particular aspect of the privacy act the privacy commissioner saidcitation needed the commissioner determined that telstra had acted immediately to prevent further breaches notify customers and review its data security practices in the report pilgrim related that the australian government is currently considering recommendations from the australian law reform commission to introduce mandatory data breach notification laws in australia see

information commissioner oaic released the findings of its investigation into a mailing list error that resulted in approximately  telstra customers personal information being sent to other customers the australian privacy commissioner timothy pilgrim said our investigation has confirmed that while telstra breached the privacy act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties this incident was caused by a oneoff human error it was not a result of telstra failing to have reasonable steps in place to protect the personal information of its customers as required by the privacy actcitation needed the government probe determined that telstra had security measures in place to protect customer personal information involved in mail campaigns these measures included privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses privacy impact assessments and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns in this instance taking into account the range of measures telstra has in place for mail campaigns i consider that the oneoff human error that occurred does not mean that telstra failed to comply with its obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information of its customers therefore i consider that telstra has not breached this particular aspect of the privacy act the privacy commissioner saidcitation needed the commissioner determined that telstra had acted immediately to prevent further breaches notify customers and review its data security practices in the report pilgrim related that the australian government is currently considering recommendations from the australian law reform commission to introduce mandatory data breach notification laws in australia see

information commissioner oaic released the findings of its investigation into a mailing list error that resulted in approximately  telstra customers personal information being sent to other customers the australian privacy commissioner timothy pilgrim said our investigation has confirmed that while telstra breached the privacy act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties this incident was caused by a oneoff human error it was not a result of telstra failing to have reasonable steps in place to protect the personal information of its customers as required by the privacy actcitation needed the government probe determined that telstra had security measures in place to protect customer personal information involved in mail campaigns these measures included privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses privacy impact assessments and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns in this instance taking into account the range of measures telstra has in place for mail campaigns i consider that the oneoff human error that occurred does not mean that telstra failed to comply with its obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information of its customers therefore i consider that telstra has not breached this particular aspect of the privacy act the privacy commissioner saidcitation needed the commissioner determined that telstra had acted immediately to prevent further breaches notify customers and review its data security practices in the report pilgrim related that the australian government is currently considering recommendations from the australian law reform commission to introduce mandatory data breach notification laws in australia see

the australian privacy commissioner timothy pilgrim said our investigation has confirmed that while telstra breached the privacy act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties this incident was caused by a oneoff human error it was not a result of telstra failing to have reasonable steps in place to protect the personal information of its customers as required by the privacy actcitation needed the government probe determined that telstra had security measures in place to protect customer personal information involved in mail campaigns these measures included privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses privacy impact assessments and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns in this instance taking into account the range of measures telstra has in place for mail campaigns i consider that the oneoff human error that occurred does not mean that telstra failed to comply with its obligation to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information of its customers therefore i consider that telstra has not breached this particular aspect of the privacy act the privacy commissioner saidcitation needed the commissioner determined that telstra had acted immediately to prevent further breaches notify customers and review its data security practices in the report

are forecast to pay a fully franked dividend equivalent to  is telstra’s dividend safe on face value the recent fall in the telstra share price has ballooned its dividend yield after all if the share price falls and the dividend payment stays the same its yield increases for example a year ago today telstra shares were priced at  and paying  cents in dividends which is equivalent to a dividend yield of  of  fastforward to today and the same dividend is forecast to be paid yet the share price has dropped to  clearly if you only had two choices you would rather buy shares today importantly as that example shows buying shares for dividends is only a good idea if you can buy shares that a don’t fall in value and b continue to pay the dividend over the next two years analysts are forecasting only a small reduction in the amount of telstra’s yearly dividends  this coming year  the next according to morningstar data but what happens to the share price over the next two years is anyone’s guess and even if the analysts are right and telstra maintains its dividends above  cents per share it’s hard to tell if it can maintain that payment over the next five years indeed looking at the industry to peers like tpg telecom ltd asx tpm and vocus group ltd asx voc telstra’s dividend yield is much higher than any other company that could imply that telstra’s future is more uncertain in my opinion the telco heavyweight will find it very very difficult to grow its per share profits over the coming handful of years most likely in my opinion telstra’s profits will fall as the nbn continues to grow and tpg and others compete fiercely in the mobiles market that’s not a terrible thing of course — but you need to pay a price which accommodates for the lower profits foolish takeaway telstra’s dividend is starting to look very appealing below  per share i think the riskreward tradeoff might begin to turn in investors’ favour however i’m not rushing out to buy telstra shares just
