architects contractors and construction companies all under one roof these fullservice firms focus on a streamlined designbuild process — from the initial design to the estimating phase to physical construction — in the hope of creating an efficient experience for both the client and the company because the entire project is happening within one company sacramento designbuild firms are able to overlap the design and construction phases of the project which often speeds up the project significantly in addition these firms work to minimize risks for the project owner through singlepoint responsibility contracts however depending on the firm you may still want to contact an interior designer or architect to help create the exact look you want here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of designbuild firms interior designers  decorators landscape architects  landscape designers architects  building designers photographersbefore deciding on a residential designandbuild company in sacramento ca think about what you want from your new home do you want a large kitchen for entertaining do you need several bedrooms for children and guests do you want a finished basement for extra space or storage look for sacramento designbuilders that specialize in the areas youre looking for budget is obviously a determining factor in the outcome of your project to make sure you stay within your means consider making a musthave list and a wish list gauge where the estimates are falling to determine which designbuild contract can realistically strike the balance between the twoquestions to ask a prospective sacramento designbuilder how long have you been in the designbuild construction business how many projects like mine have you completed who will be working on the project are the workers employees or subcontractors can you provide me with references who is your designer and what are his or her qualifications are your employees licensed and insured how do you charge and what does that include can you give me a written estimate what do your services include when can this job get done what happens when cost exceeds the budget what about changes to materials or labor pricing what will i need to provide are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this projectfind a sacramento designbuild company on
