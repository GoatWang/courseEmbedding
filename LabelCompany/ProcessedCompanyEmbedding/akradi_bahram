news archive search tennisindustrymagcom subscribe to tennis industry advertise with tennis industry tennis industry magazine   home » ti magazine » awards » person of the year bahram akradi person of the year bahram akradi by peter francesconi at first blush it might seem a stretch to pick as tennis industry’s person of the year the founder president and ceo of a chain of fitness clubs but life time fitness is no ordinary string of clubs and bahram akradi is no ordinary ceo in fact when it comes to tennis and well all things fitness related life time is quite extraordinary “we want to make sure that whatever sports we offer we do it in the absolute best fashion” says the yearold akradi “we spend an enormous amount of time creating a sense of place we work hard to cast the right staff and to make sure our programs are second to none” and it’s that story that has taken the chanhassen minnbased life time fitness from  million in revenues in  to a  billion company today and from a single club to now having  employees at  facilities with more on the way there are more than  memberships including family memberships which translates into “a couple of million” men women and children belonging to a life time club tennis investment tenniswise life time has been investing in the sport for years and it’s hit on a formula that provides topnotch facilities amenities and programs for its tennis players the company now has more than  courts at  locations including  indoor courts making life time fitness the largest operator of indoor courts in the us “we are building tennis and continue to look for opportunities” says akradi who was always into fitness but started playing tennis later in life in fact the newest life time facility opened in november in henderson nev near las vegas has  courts — four outdoors and eight indoors in typical life time fashion the indoor courts are cushioned rebound ace in a beautiful facility “i didn’t want to have tennis when i first started” akradi admits “when you look at revenue per square foot for tennis versus other things it’s a headscratcher but we ended up buying a club and excess land near detroit then bought wellbridge clubs and before we knew it we were doing tennis now i love the sport and as we delivered the complete spectrum of athletics i wanted to offer tennis along with squash and racquetball” life time says greg lappin the company’s national tennis director is very committed to the sport “the business plan for new builds is to attract the top  percent of the market so wherever they purchase property they try to have land for tennis” he says lappin says akradi figured out that while tennis may not be as lucrative per square foot tennis players are much more committed “with fitness people onethird may leave every year” lappin says “the tennis attrition is  to  percent at the better facilities and that’s what we’re finding our member retention is excellent and when you look at who spends the most in ancillary expenditures in clubs that have tennis it’s the tennis members they stay longer and they spend more” and they will travel further to play the story of life time fitness though wouldn’t be complete without touching on akradi’s story the son of an iranian air force officer akradi was  years old when he left his home in tehran in  just ahead of the iranian revolution he moved to colorado where he lived with an older brother washed dishes at a restaurant and enrolled in his senior year in high school akradi took college courses at pikes peak community college then at university of colorado–colorado springs for electrical engineering he also worked the graveyard shift at a nautilus fitness club from there he started selling memberships then in a few years comanaged a nautilus club in minnesota he soon was looking for new locations to open up nautilus clubs along the way akradi who had always been into working out and keeping fit developed his own strategy about how to run a successful customercentric health and fitness business in  he left behind a big salary and struck out with his first life time fitness location in brooklyn park minn now the massive elegant life time facilities offer everything from racquet sports to swimming to fitness classes to basketball weightlifting aerobics — the roster is nearly endless the rows of aerobic machines are truly impressive many locations have a café that serves healthy food and there are areas for entertaining relaxing and socializing focus on the customer “when i started life time i had looked at how we were doing business in this industry as a whole and i was disappointed in the fitness industry’s perspective on how they dealt with customers” akradi says “everything was from a business owner’s point of view but it wasn’t the best product service or program “we wanted to design a club that in all ways suited the members so we have a monthtomonth membership we give our customers a long leash for moneyback guarantees we wanted to do everything right for the customer” that thinking also is why akradi offers the rebound ace surface “when life time does something” adds lappin “it does it top shelf i really enjoy rebound ace it’s much softer it adds a few hundred thousand dollars to the bill but for our customers it’s worth it it’s our commitment to giving a firstclass product” with tennis akradi is hoping to work more with the usta “to build a program where we can sponsor and pay for kids on a regular basis” he says “i really want life time to impact tennis in america in a big way” akradi himself plays tennis once or twice a week and sees the sport as important in the overall scheme of health and fitness in addition he still keeps very active with other fitness activities including biking and cycling but his passion is in giving customers what they want and need — and doing it in the best way possible “that’s allowed us to evolve and get better all the time” he says — peter francesconi tips for success create a “sense of place that appeals to all the senses” bahram akradi says go for the best in all things even if it costs more to begin with and be consistent it’s all about the customer everything life time fitness does considers the customer first see all articles by peter francesconi about the author peter francesconi is editorial director of tennis industry
