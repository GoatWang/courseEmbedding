heads by richard boyer cfp® cfa  thursday  september  aside from super bowls the first  presidential debate to be held on september th figures to be the most watched prime time program in the history of television which is really odd because when i talk to people i don’t seem to run into very many “undecided” voters with rare exception virtually every person is either voting for hillary clinton because they think she is the most qualified or because they can’t stand donald trump or voting for donald because they can’t stand hillary ostensibly debates are conducted to help voters decide who is the most qualified candidate so if everyone already has made up his or her mind why would the debate have such a large audience because it is going to be incredibly entertaining that’s why viewers will be glued to their tvs to see if donald can be successful dragging the debate into playground banter meanwhile they will be watching to see if hillary can maintain her composure better than the republican candidates did during the primary debates we frequently get asked our opinion about the effects of the election on investments we’re not even sure how to respond to that question today our first thought when asked that question is that presidents get way too much credit when the economy and markets are good and they get way too much blame when they are bad there are global and geopolitical forces at work that have a much greater effect than the results of election day ultimately fiscal policy does become important but we’re not yet sure what to be concerned about yes hillary has made it clear that she wants to bring down the cost of health care particularly pharmaceutical costs but can she be successful and will that overcome the massive wave of aging baby boomers’ demand for health care if drug stocks declined after election day we might use that as a buying opportunity if donald is elected president should we own more defense stocks and should we invest in companies that manufacture bricks because it will take a lot of bricks to build that wall when watching the debates there are several important issues that should concern you as a us citizen and registered voter i wrote about two of them in the august investment commentary vote one major issue is the supreme court and how many vacancies might open during the next presidential term the other issue is jobs or lack thereof you should try to ascertain which candidate will be most successful creating quality jobs for the middle class the gap between the “haves” and the “havenots” has grown wider than ever and it is beginning to threaten the political ideology of this country we need a more vibrant economy that generates jobs for the average american markets took the month of august off and went to the beach neither the sp  nor the all world index nor the barclays aggregate bond index was up or down more than  the two stock indexes were up a smidge and bonds were down a smidge maybe the calm before the storm we didn’t say that for the calendar year us stocks are up  while the all world ex us index was up  bonds are up just under  not a bad year so far in spite of august sitting this one out we know this is a slight exaggeration but it seems as if almost every minute of every day the drones at cnbc obsess about whether or not the fed is going to raise interest rates all day long someone is opining about the odds that the fed will or will not raise interest rates and the amount of interest rate hike they are obsessing about is  so what who cares we realize this is in part due to the fact that they have very little else to talk about but we are here to tell you this is much ado about nothing for the record our opinion is that they won’t raise rates but even if they do what’s the big deal it’s a nonevent if the stock market reacts significantly to a rate increase it will be shortlived… as short as the brexit reaction so quit worrying about a rate increase by the fed and worry about fiscal policy that will foster an economy that will create good jobs… lots of good jobs at boyer  corporon wealth management we are not yet seeing signs of a recession and are not yet hedging our equity positions this year we’ve been beefing up our allocations to emerging markets particularly brazil chile russia india and south africa as well as our allocations to gold and gold mining companies we are not shortening our durations in bonds but are finding it difficult to locate good quality bonds with any kind of decent yield tweet sign up to

cfp® cfa  tuesday  august  in what will easily be the most bizarre presidential campaign in our lives maybe in history i am telling you today that it is important that you vote i’m not telling you which candidate should receive your vote my investment commentary remains impartial for a reason but never in my life have i heard so many people say “i hate them both so i’m not going to vote” and it’s a fair statement both of them are not very likable each for their own special reasons although there may be other good reasons for you to cast a ballot foreign policy deficit spending fiscal policy she’s a liar he’s a loose cannon the most important reason is the supreme court over the next four years there are likely to be as many as four new vacancies on the supreme court the president of the united states gets to choose who fills those vacancies yes congress has to confirm the selection but they only vote on who the president chooses and whoever gets selected and confirmed serves on the supreme court for the rest of his or her life which means whoever wins in november will likely have a large impact on this country and our lives for the next  to  years if you would like for the supreme court to become very liberal then you probably should cast your vote for hillary clinton if you would like for the supreme court to become more conservative you should probably cast your vote for donald trump you might think “it doesn’t matter if i vote because my state be it california or kansas is so heavily democratic or republican my vote won’t even matter” ordinarily that’s probably a true statement but i think this is a year that traditional voting trends could get turned upsidedown just a feeling however if you live in one of the traditional “swing states” ohio michigan indiana pennsylvania florida etc you definitely need to vote the biggest red flag to come out of this presidential campaign is that bernie sanders generated as much support as he did either hillary underestimated his potential and ran a really bad campaign or bernie’s message is starting to sound really good to a lot of people maybe a little bit of both at the democratic convention the crowd cheered when bernie was introduced and they kept cheering for about three to four minutes this is scary when socialist ideology begins to sound like a better system a capitalist society needs to listen the reality is that the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” in the united states has gradually grown wider and wider over the past three decades if it continues to grow wider the next “bernie sanders” will likely garner even more support and may actually become the democratic nominee it’s conceivable that a socialist candidate could become president someday…unless the “haves” sit up and listen…and vote for the candidate that will create meaningful jobs for the middle class and narrow the gap between ultrarich and everyone else i’m not sure i know who that candidate is but in the long run it is the candidate who says he or she intends to shrink the size of the government for the past sixteen years or more we have watched the government grow dramatically under both a republican bush and a democratic obama president governments don’t create meaningful jobs the private sector does the larger the government the smaller the private sector vote for the candidate who outlines well how he or she intends to create private sector jobs otherwise brace yourself for an even larger government than we already have…and eventually a socialist government you won’t want to own stocks if that happens the stock market loved last month during july the sp  increased  and it has increased  for the past  months since the recession ended in february  it is up  an annual rate of  of course that’s cherry picking from the bottom of the stock market crash if you dial the returns back to the end of october  the sp is only up  annually as i’m writing this the dow jones industrial average the sp  and the nasdaq are all three hitting record highs the first time that has happened since december  if i recall correctly what happened shortly after december  was not pretty the sp  peaked in march  and fell over  over the next  months and those were the good stocks because this was a “tech stock bubble” the technology laden nasdaq declined over  we are not necessarily predicting a  –  market crash in the next two years the nasdaq while it has had a nice run is trading nowhere near the ridiculous valuations at which it was trading in  although there were many insane tech stock stories one of my favorites involves a stock called jds uniphase at the peak of investor tech stock insanityeuphoria it traded at  per share adjusted for splits in  at its nadir it traded at  per share they have since changed the name of the company probably so that we would quit talking about them we do however feel that stocks are not cheap they are not horribly expensive but they are not cheap markets have traded at much higher prices relative to earnings than they are today and seldom have we experienced interest rates this low when the risk free rate of return remains low the temptation to invest in risky assets becomes more attractive many stocks today pay dividends greater than the interest rate on the year treasury bond in an environment where interest rates are very low stocks can become very expensive…and more expensive…and even more expensive and if investor perception is that interest rates might go even lower stocks can get ridiculously expensive as investors misprice risk in order to get a reasonable return this has the potential to end very badly meanwhile interest rates remain ridiculously low and will remain ridiculously low for a long time earlier this month the bank of england boe reduced interest rates by  to  the boe also pledged to purchase billions of pounds of high grade corporate bonds in order to keep rates low the us bond market continues its year bull run interest rates declining in july the year us treasury bond traded as low as  closing the last day of july at  the year closed the month at  after trading as low as  at boyer  corporon wealth management we have increased the duration of our fixed income securities since we feel interest rates will remain low and possibly go lower although we are not yet reducing or hedging our equity positions we are nervous but as long as interest rates remain low and trend even lower investors will probably continue to drive stock prices higher tweet sign up to receive
