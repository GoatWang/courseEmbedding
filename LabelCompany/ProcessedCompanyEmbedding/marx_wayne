this is a completely random paragraph on a completely random page its not a surprise every single page every single page has something intellectually or sexually offensive on it if ever a book

product really expressed his view of the true total new value added or the net product in his view this total is equal to the value of wage payments  surplus value the latter which would include apart from net profit interest and rent the net tax levy and royaltytype fees paid in respect of incomes generated by production of output plus the surplusvalue component of unsold inventories of new output marx himself never discussed taxation and royaltyincome in detail they were only a small portion of the total national income when he lived around  or so an additional comment by marxedit marx claims that in an accounting period the workforce in the capitalist sector normally produces a new value which is equal to its own wagecost plus an additional new value called surplus value however marx warns that the habit of representing surplusvalue and value of laborpower as fractions of the value created — a habit that originates in the capitalist mode of production itself and whose import will hereafter be disclosed — conceals the very transaction that characterizes capital namely the exchange of variable capital for living laborpower and the consequent exclusion of the laborer from the product instead of the real fact we have false semblance of an association in which laborer and capitalist divide the product in proportion to the different elements which they respectively contribute towards its formation  — karl marx for this reason marx criticized ratios such as the share of profits and wages wage share in the gross or net product as deceptive because they disguised the real capitalist relations of production specifically the rate of surplus value his primary interest was in the ratio between generic profits and wages the rate of exploitation marxian new value added versus gdpedit the equation of new value added with net output or gdp also known as gross value added would have made no sense to marx mainly because net output includes depreciation or the consumption of fixed capital yet excludes various property rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income on the ground that renting out an asset does not itself constitute production as well as a portion of net interest regarded as property income as regards depreciation for marx the value of real depreciation at least did not constitute any new value but value conserved and transferred to the new products by living labor it appeared as added value only because when costs are deducted from gross sales income to obtain net profit depreciation is regarded as a component of the new gross profit income in official national accounts a distinction is made between gross value added including depreciation charges and net value added excluding them of course in reality it could be that real economic depreciation diverges from depreciation for tax purposes in that case the reported consumption of fixed capital could contain an element of undistributed profit additionally official national accounts may include in consumption of fixed capital the value of those insurance premiums interest and rents paid from gross income which relate directly to the acquisition or maintenance of productive fixed assets on the ground that they are part of the cost of operating productive fixed assets in marxian economics however these flows would be regarded either as a faux frais of production a circulating constant capital outlay or an element of gross surplus value by contrast marx considered rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income as a part of surplus value and as an integral part of the cost structure of the social product business rents excluded as intermediate expenditures from gdp therefore are included in the marxian value product as a component of surplus value from a marxian point of view official value added also includes some dubious components such as the rental value of owneroccupied housing this entry is the market rent of owneroccupied housing that would apply if the housing was rented treated as a service but most of it does not refer to any real flow of income nor is it clear that this component has anything to do with production as regards net interest the official product accounts will exclude a portion of it insofar as it is defined as property income unrelated to the value of production but if it is paid from current gross revenues of producing enterprises then it should be included in the marxian value product for this reason the marxian net interest aggregate is likely to be larger than the official one criticism and controversyedit marxs idea of value creation and value product makes little sense from the point of view of the theory of factors of production and production functions marx himself already anticipated this in chapter  of capital vol  titled the trinity formula where he discusses the view that land labour and capital which he sarcastically calls the holy trinity of political economy all create a new value equal to factor income marx regarded human labour and land as the mainsprings of material wealth but he considered value as a purely social attribution referring to laborcontent in modern macroeconomics the controversy surfaces again and is discussed in amusing essays by prof anwar shaikh see references in marxian social accounting one theoretical controversy concerns the treatment of the wages of socalled productive and unproductive labour unproductive labour by definition does not make net additions to the new value product but only transfers value from other sectors on the basis that it reduces the costs of capitalist production depending on how the gross and net product are defined the value of these wages could be accounted for either as a component of surplus value or as a circulating constant capital outlay or be excluded from the value product altogether different interpretations are offered by shane mage murray smith anwar shaikh and fred moseley one aspect often overlooked in this controversy is that wages costs and labour costs are not the same thing employers and employees must also pay social insurance levies of various types and there may be other imposts on wages also the buying power of wages is reduced by indirect tax imposts and profit imposts this affects the magnitude of a societys variable capital and the value of labour power another marxian accounting controversy less discussed concerns which net tax receipts of government constitute part of the new value product obviously taxes included in official gross product measures do not equal the net total tax take because some taxes are unrelated to production and therefore excluded the marxian critique of public finance appears to be rather undeveloped as yet however in principle net tax levied on current production and paid out of current gross revenues would be included in the value product least discussed is the problem of finding a nonarbitrary rigorous distinction between value created and value transferred in respect of services the conceptual problem here is essentially that it may be difficult to specify unambiguously what the nature and function of the product sold is when services are rendered some marxists have argued however that marxs value relations and value aggregates cannot be measured at all and at best only experienced that was manifestly not marxs view already in his grundrisse manuscript he had referred to a balance sheet cited by malthus in das kapital he attempted to calculate the rate of surplus value according to data provided by frederick engels and towards the end of his life as leontief noted he wrote that he wanted to study the ups and downs of economic activity mathematically but samuel moore convinced him that the data to do it did not exist yet engels later remarked that the problem really was that much data relevant to testing marxs concepts simply was not available subsequent marxian scholars have argued the critique of political economy should continue with regard to the new economic concepts and theories rather than stop at the point where the ink dried on the last sheet of paper that marx wrote on one reason is that the new concepts and theories might distort the representation of economic reality just as much as the old ones that marx criticized in the ussr and other soviettype societies marxs social accounting approach strongly influenced the material product system mps a social accounting method alternative to gdp accounts which distinguished sharply between productive and nonproductive sectors of the economy these accounts focused on balances of the value of material goods produced in some respects this is ironic since marxs social accounting referred to the capitalist economy not to a socialist economy the mps accounts were abandoned in favour of gdp accounts after the downfall of official communism in the ussr and eastern europe although they are still compiled as parallel accounts in north korea and cuba see alsoedit gross output net output surplus value surplus product surplus labour operating surplus
