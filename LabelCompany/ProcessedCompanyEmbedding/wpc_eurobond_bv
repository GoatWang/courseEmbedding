disclosure due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies as discussed below the national association of real estate investment trusts inc or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a nongaap measure known as ffo which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental nongaap measure ffo is not equivalent to nor a substitute for net income or loss as determined under gaap we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit as revised in february  the white paper defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairment charges on real estate and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are calculated to reflect ffo our ffo calculation complies with nareits policy described above we modify the nareit computation of ffo to include other adjustments to gaap net income to adjust for certain noncash charges such as amortization of real estaterelated intangibles deferred income tax benefits and expenses straightline rents stock compensation gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and deconsolidation of subsidiaries and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses our assessment of our operations is focused on longterm sustainability and not on such noncash items which may cause shortterm fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows additionally we exclude noncore income and expenses such as property acquisition and other expenses which includes costs recorded related to the restructuring of hellweg  the reversal of liabilities for german real estate transfer taxes that were previously recorded in connection with the cpa® merger and our formal strategic review certain lease termination income and expenses related to restructuring and other compensationrelated expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount and employee severance arrangements we also exclude realized gainslosses on foreign exchange transactions other than those realized on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall longterm operating performance we refer to our modified definition of ffo as affo we exclude these items from gaap net income to arrive at affo as they are not the primary drivers in our decision making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our portfolio performance over time and makes it more comparable to other reits which are currently not engaged in acquisitions mergers and restructuring which are not part of our normal business operations we use affo as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies and determine executive compensation we believe that affo is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as we believe it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these shortterm fluctuations however there are limits on the usefulness of affo to investors for example impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations we use our ffo and affo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo and affo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

arrangements primarily in connection with the reduction in force that we completed in march  nongaap financial disclosure due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies as discussed below the national association of real estate investment trusts inc or nareit an industry trade group has promulgated a nongaap measure known as ffo which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap to reflect the operating performance of a reit the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental nongaap measure ffo is not equivalent to nor a substitute for net income or loss as determined under gaap we define ffo a nongaap measure consistent with the standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit as revised in february  the white paper defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairment charges on real estate and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are calculated to reflect ffo our ffo calculation complies with nareits policy described above we modify the nareit computation of ffo to include other adjustments to gaap net income to adjust for certain noncash charges such as amortization of real estaterelated intangibles deferred income tax benefits and expenses straightline rents stock compensation gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and deconsolidation of subsidiaries and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses our assessment of our operations is focused on longterm sustainability and not on such noncash items which may cause shortterm fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows additionally we exclude noncore income and expenses such as property acquisition and other expenses which includes expenses related to the formal strategic review that we completed in may  certain lease termination income and expenses related to restructuring and other compensationrelated expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount and employee severance arrangements during the three months ended march   we also exclude realized gainslosses on foreign exchange transactions other than those realized on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall longterm operating performance we refer to our modified definition of ffo as affo we exclude these items from gaap net income to arrive at affo as they are not the primary drivers in our decision making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our portfolio performance over time and makes it more comparable to other reits which are currently not engaged in acquisitions mergers and restructuring which are not part of our normal business operations we use affo as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies and determine executive compensation we believe that affo is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as we believe it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these shortterm fluctuations however there are limits on the usefulness of affo to investors for example impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations we use our ffo and affo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance we do not use our ffo and affo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs
