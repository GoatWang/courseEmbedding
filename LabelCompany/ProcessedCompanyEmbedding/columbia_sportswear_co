recommend checking out this columbia store for your sportswear needs great inventory i love their omni tech clothing line great savings if you shop when theyve got a holiday savings like presidents weekend thanksgiving weekend etc great deals i got a fleece jacket for  originally priced at  they have a large selection for both men and women leah the supervisor in charge today was incredibly rude to me she displayed a total lack of customer service concerning my return i understand your policy but you do not address customers in the cold and unprofessional way that she did to me i was simply asking for store credit for an item purchased  days ago with which i have a receipt and the credit card used for the purchase she was incredibly cold and told me t go ahead and call her corporate office to complain do not buy anything in this store or at any columbia store or that matter rei had the best return policy and sells columbia items they dont treat their customers like thieves and deviants ever the workers here are very friendly and helpful i was looking for a winter jacket but since im always cold it would be an everyday jacket i been eyeing this jacket for  months but decided to wait since it was still summer but with the approach of winter coming a long and the announcement of  new stores i have decided to hit this outlet up again i still dont agree with the name of this outlet as i dont think it would draw more people in let alone tourists but i am glad i went on a whim with my friend and made a day out of it they had a good sale at this time  off additionally the jacket i wanted was priced at  with an additional  off it came down to  before taxes but at checkout it rang for  the cashier told me it was on sale because it was last years style score the customer service here is superb i asked for  different sizes and they were happy to assist me everyone i encountered was very friendly and accommodating and because of this i will always return this columbia sportswear outlet is located inside the livermore premium outlets and although yes they may have some sales and all my family and i never end up purchasing anything from this store they have nice clothing and all specifically for outdoors but its just that prices here are too freaking high this is a pretty expensive store so the quality is good but its just too expensive its worth taking a look i suppose though i have gotten my favorite jacket here and at an awesome price i love the selection definitely better deals during the week a disappointment where an outdoor store carries so little mens choices i was happy until walking in and seeing the less than a quarter of the store with mens clothing so about  different pants  different shirts  different vest and  different jackets the rest is womens childrensand accessories im headed to truckee for my first snowboarding in  daysim doing last minute snow gear shoppingwe actually drove from daly city to livermore with my friend to shop herethe store is nice lots of discounted clothing jackets winter gear etcfrom  to  offeverything seems to be well stockedright now im actively yelping while inside this store five stars goes out to jacqueline whose excellent customer service politeness honesty and her desire to assist customers really made my first columbia gear buying experience a pleasant one thank you for helping me get my first snow pantswith this positive experience ill be a repeat columbia costumeroh yes their gear are also comfy and will keep you warm and dry the products are worth checking out compared to north face this is a cheaper alternative that you can afford pros great big selection of items good amount of staff on the floor clean and well lit cons staff should be properly trained to where all general items are where can i find the snow pants sorry i dont know that doesnt help tips last time i came in they hired a bunch of new college level workers fobs at the job it was hard to find a worker who knew where selected items were weekends have the best sales nothing during weekdays college student discount with id card im not sure if it was a hitormiss thingbut i came here for the st time and was able to find a few items they were good prices much better prices i got from the north face i was able to find  jackets and a top and some shoes i will return to get a couple of more items next time i also went to the other outlet location but was unable to find anything so i believe this location has a much better stock when making a return with a receipt if the cashier ask to see your id just show them do not hand your id to them the cashier will scan your id without telling you beforehand i am not sure what they will do with your info and they will say it is protocol which is not a good explanation amazing service anthony and levi are very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with the purchases i made  stars ill be coming back soon pretty good selection of ski jackets when i went i found a great deal on the jacket and ski pants i purchased i also found a couple of other sweaters i liked for my weekend in the snow that were marked down i signed up for their rewards program online the night before and they were nice enough to honor the  discount only valid instore the staff was friendly and helpful i liked this store and plan to come back next time i need some more gear meh they didnt have anything that spectacular here  the prices were barely discounted you can find a better selection  better prices online if you catch a sale the prices are good the service is excellent despite it being a crowded crazy weekend the staff were cheerful and helpful the salesperson went into the back to pull the size i needed which was not on the floor and i got a lovely new gray fleece for  dollars i love my other columbia fleece and wear it almost year round so ill use the new fleece a lot too the selection isnt outstanding but its good enough i do recommend trying clothes on there if you are going to buy online to get an idea of sizing i wear a size small in almost everything but in columbia clothes i am more comfortable in a medium especially to have room to wear things under the jacket or fleece the best place to shop for outerwear in the east bay columbia sportswear has super awesome technology meant to withstand all sorts of weather the people who work here are knowledgeable and friendly the prices are spectacular i got a pair of sorel boots for really cheap their clearance shoe table is always stocked in my opinion columbia is waaay better than northface and the garments last that much longer with a new location out in the trivalley hikers runners and skiers alike will definitely find something for themselves do you need sporty clothes how about outdoors clothes then you should go to the columbia outlet they had a good selection of new things and helpful people the clothes were laid out like any store nicely on racks the selection seemed very similar to what i would find at rei or otherwise regular in season normal clothes with a variety of sizes at a significant discount i was asked if i needed help a few times they ended up starting a room in the fitting area for me and even brought other sizes when the clothes i had didnt fit of course i think the ratio of staff to guests was close to  when i went so they should pay attention came here during a th of july weekend sale and this place was crazy tons of good deals but it was hard to find your size since there were sooo many people around the store was clean but with lots of people  messy store the line to the dressing room was ridiculously long but people moved in an orderly fashion overall i found great hiking pants and a sweater here all for less than  great quality and good deals during an event i would recommend shopping here if you are at the outlets friendly staff and good lighting check in tip last minute snow boarding gear shopping for

form many times but it does not work probably because it thinks email addresses cant have a plus sign in them then i opened  support tickets over the course of  months each time they told me they unsubscribed me yet i still receive email from them i regret giving them my email but i do not regret buying a jacket from them its one of my daily drivers my review is regarding customer service after placing an online order i question the speed of delivery order and after two full weeks still no package i tied to trace it but it may no sense coming to california on the west coast package was in chicago for several days when i question the customer care rep i was told delivery is between  days i told her that was not what my email shipping notice informed me of i was basically told i had to wait still waiting package was now in iowa again im on west coast as the company is too after several rude email from customer care rep i was still left with no answers or package so i went to the mall and purchase another mothers day gift finally after two plus weeks package arrived i know one reason it took so long the box was rererecycled and previous labels were not removed now at checkout i did not check box to recycle box ask to speak with supervisor still waiting all i received was another rude email for customer care more like customer careless rep i really love columbia clothing but i will look for another company their products is a piece of junk very poor quality i bought a few thousand dollars worth of stuff for my whole families we wore it for the first time and  of the coats stitches by the armpit came apart will never buy this piece sht again waste my time returning itcolumbia need to fired the ceo i have a pair of columbia boots that are a few years old they are a winter boot that i wear only in the snowiest of conditions i will never by a pair of columbia boots again in fact ill never by a columbia product again the seams tore out of these boots rendering them useless in the winter i wrote columbia but got no response these are boots supposedly made for the toughest conditions like columbias moto tested tough yeah right do not buy columbia boots and if you expect customer service dont by columbia products at all its sad because i use to be a fan of columbia products when i go to buy winter boots in the future ill get sorels lifetime warranty unless its classified as a sportswear item then it only has a one year warranty so if the zipper stop falls off and so does the zipper make sure it happens within  days stuff happens but then the company should step up and fix oh i could mail back and they would evaluate and let me know but probably not on a small positive note i did receive a quick and professional response to my email but that didnt help fix my wifes jacket not satisfied never again i bought a light columbia coat and the zipper jammed with my car keys inside i had to cut the coat open to get my keys i always give companies a second chance i bought another jacket and the exact situation happened keys in the pocket i own a lot of coats cheap and nice and these are the only brand that has failed me i tried to return it and they told me to send it in postage on me and they will probably give you a new one never mind keep your bad product purchased a  backpack and after  weeks of use my fourth grade son has a giant rip at the seam they want me to return it for a repair and to pay shipping they will pay the shipping if they determine it is warranted obviously i cant wait the  weeks for my son to have a backpack i had to go and buy a jansport now i am suppose to pay  to ship it back to them and have them return a backpack i dont need or want they wouldnt even offer to pay for shipping horrible customer service for defective and poor quality bag in general ive been a big fan of columbia gear and especially their pfg line out of  pfg shirts i own or have owned i had one of my tamiami ii pfg shirts have a neck tag go bad after a hot day fishing in the louisiana summer the tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck i washed the shirt on coldcold cycle like i always do and on removing it from the wash i noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldnt come off i emailed columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed i should just mail it to the warranty dept so i did the warranty dept mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldnt cover my shirt all i want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way this is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they wont share the information i was excited to make my first purchase on this website and i was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale so i bought it on saturday eager to have it this week so i paid extra for  day shipping on tuesday the status check on the website simply said processing no eta of a delivery date or even shipping date i emailed customer service and didnt hear back so tuesday evening i called to inquire they said its  or  business days after a  day processing ok fine i would get it wed or thur wednesday came thursday came and still nothing i did finally receive a ups tracking number from them and when i tracked it i was given a delivery date of thursday but now its friday and still nothing i contacted ups and they said they still havent received the item to ship and i needed to contact the seller so now i am sitting on the phone on hold my initial wait time was estimated to be  minutes every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time but my hold time is going up instead of down now its at  minutes i still never did receive an email response from their customer service im a little stunned i thought columbia was a decent brand and the gear seems to be but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere which i will be after receiving this jacket whenever that will be i would put a big old goose egg  if i could i want to be clear that i am reviewing the company customer service here not the products the products have always been great thats why what happened to me disheartens me even more  if you order from online you should be aware that if your package is lost or in my case stolen while in transit with ups or fed ex columbia customer service becomes your worst nightmare they should call it columbia service instead of customer service because they dont treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you i placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale i tracked the package until it reached il and that is where it stopped and my headache began i called columbia c and told them that my package has not arrived by the eta and i was told that i need to wait at least  days past the eta to see if it shows up mind you they have my  they were willing and happy to take that but i had no product so i patiently waited the  days tracked the package again to the same distribution center in il i called c back and i was told that they would open up an investigation request they informed me that this could take  business days to complete so i asked if i could have a refund or could they ship me a new package i was told that this is not their policy by several other people as well in the company i was beside myself how could a company this huge treat me a great frequent customer as though it was my fault the package was lost they could have put a tracer on the package and had if found it sent back to columbia in the meantime i should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase but nooooooooooooooooo it didnt end there i wrote email after email call after call and i kept getting told that the investigation with ups was not complete i have a friend with ups access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes the notes said that they found the mittens outside of the box and the jacket was never found the jacket was marked stolen and the mittens were shipped back to c you know what i was told at this point i had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to c i cant even tell you how livid i was why do i have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest was closed and completed i finally got my money back a month after i ordered thanks columbia you lost a great customer thanks but no thanks for the offer of  off an order you are all heart horrible customer service order a jacket for son based on sizing cart indicates runs bigger turned out its smaller then sizing indicates so i called same day when receiving package asked for a exchange from small to medium and they still have other size on same color asked me to ship jacket back so mailed next day when returned and i checked tracking that return were back at columbia about  working days later called customer service and and they told me the same color dont have size left besides large bewarecolumbia customer service may not repair or replace your item but choose to give you a few dollars ecredit i asked for my item back but they recycle or donate them i did not know that was an option i should have kept my item and gotten it fixed myself now i have lost my great rain garment that looked simple to fix seams splitting all over a garment that is worn a few times seems like a manufacturing error i returned a pair of hiking boots after  months of light use the left boot sole came unglued and fell apart i had to pay  to ship them back on top of the original purchase price  weeks later i got the boots back columbia reglued them in a half assed way you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece it was a joke the letter that came back with the boots from quality control stated that the boots were out of the  year warranty period i had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than  year the boots were clearly defective and still are i threw them away because of the idiotic treatment i received i would choose any name brand before a columbia product they could have done the right thing and gained a customer but they chose to screw me nice work columbia this company sucks apparently in  i placed an order for  i returned some items as they were christmas gifts and due to columbias inconsistent sizing i had to send things back apparently now i am unable to place an order and so is everyone in my household including our apartment there are three households st this residence and a total of  different credit cards and they will not accept an order from any of them even tried using a gift card and it will not go through this is ridiculous i am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me i love that they offer good quality real sportswear in plus sizes for women their clothing is good quality well fitting and beautiful i dont live in an area with a columbia store so i order online even so i have never purchased a product from this website that i needed to return and every single time i wear a columbia garment i get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where i buy my clothes the last time i purchased a shirt from columbia my husband told me that i looked beautiful and said i should get one in each color they offered as a plus sized woman i have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hardtofit bodies charging premium prices for poor quality goods simply because our choices are scarce i cannot express how much i appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts when i wear columbia i feel comfortable beautiful and dressed appropriately for the rocky mountain region where i live i heartily recommend columbia like several other notable formerly proud and once market leading companies see rayban hoover vacuum et alsorel has been purchased for its brand cache and is systematically being transformed into a made in china or viet nam fashion focused inferior product oriented over priced corporate cash cow the heritage of quality and performance has been traded for return on investment my expensive sorels lasted exactly one hour in the subzero january temperatures that we have suffered recently in the midwest before they completely disintegrated i returned them to the factory based on the instructions provided by the customer service person at sorel and the warranty evaluator rejected my claim technically they were out of the warranty period but when you drop a buck fifty on a pair of winter boots you expect them to out perform your daughters hello kitty boots that wasnt the case if you want an exceptional pair of extreme weather boots grab a pair of us army surplus mickey mouse boots manufactured by bata they are absolutey the warmest most durable boots youll ever own and theyre available all over the internet for bout  skip the junk that columbia is cranking out in china and calling sorel i used to like columbia clothing as it was generally constructed of quality material the last two purchases have completely changed my mind i just spent  on a sweater that began to pill after just two washes the last sweater i bought turned into a giant ball of pilly fuzz within a week ill not spend another nickel on anything made by this brand i disagree with the orange head review columbia is the bees knees i bought a bugaboo parka in  from some rando sporting goods site and we had several good years together sadly the zipper died and i needed to send it in for repair just in time for a cold snap and of course i have a trip to iceland coming up as well womp womp so off to oregon it went once i saw they received it i gave them a call to check on it and explain that i kinda needed it back and was answered by a lovely woman who listened to my plight and set about helping find a solution for me she told me i was getting a replacement and we went through the options i had available to me in less than half an hour a new coat was ordered and columbia had made a huge fan out of me a spankin new coat arrived at my office today and i love it columbia stands behind its products with great customer service what more can you ask for they offer free shipping but you have to pay for returns there is not a choice to evenly exchange an item for a different size you return the item for a refund and place a new order the jacket i bought is now  times as much bought a pair of mens birke trail light weight hikers on  wore them maybe  times and the toe box failed and woretore through due to substandard suede i sent them in to columbia and they proceeded to loose them for two weeks after they received them after numerous phone calls they finally found them and i was told in late april that they would get back to me asap once they were evaluated here is it  and i had heard nothing so i called and was put on hold for  minutes while the rep looked up the info he them informed me that they could replace them and they were waiting for me to contact them not what they told me back in late april either way they dont have the shoes i had purchased so they will replace them with a similar shoe and it will be another  weeks before i get them columbia used to be a great company not any more i will buy from anyone but them in the future most likely lands end north face etc columbia sportswear unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed by the owner or a representative claim this

ive tried using their unsubscribe form many times but it does not work probably because it thinks email addresses cant have a plus sign in them then i opened  support tickets over the course of  months each time they told me they unsubscribed me yet i still receive email from them i regret giving them my email but i do not regret buying a jacket from them its one of my daily drivers my review is regarding customer service after placing an online order i question the speed of delivery order and after two full weeks still no package i tied to trace it but it may no sense coming to california on the west coast package was in chicago for several days when i question the customer care rep i was told delivery is between  days i told her that was not what my email shipping notice informed me of i was basically told i had to wait still waiting package was now in iowa again im on west coast as the company is too after several rude email from customer care rep i was still left with no answers or package so i went to the mall and purchase another mothers day gift finally after two plus weeks package arrived i know one reason it took so long the box was rererecycled and previous labels were not removed now at checkout i did not check box to recycle box ask to speak with supervisor still waiting all i received was another rude email for customer care more like customer careless rep i really love columbia clothing but i will look for another company their products is a piece of junk very poor quality i bought a few thousand dollars worth of stuff for my whole families we wore it for the first time and  of the coats stitches by the armpit came apart will never buy this piece sht again waste my time returning itcolumbia need to fired the ceo i have a pair of columbia boots that are a few years old they are a winter boot that i wear only in the snowiest of conditions i will never by a pair of columbia boots again in fact ill never by a columbia product again the seams tore out of these boots rendering them useless in the winter i wrote columbia but got no response these are boots supposedly made for the toughest conditions like columbias moto tested tough yeah right do not buy columbia boots and if you expect customer service dont by columbia products at all its sad because i use to be a fan of columbia products when i go to buy winter boots in the future ill get sorels lifetime warranty unless its classified as a sportswear item then it only has a one year warranty so if the zipper stop falls off and so does the zipper make sure it happens within  days stuff happens but then the company should step up and fix oh i could mail back and they would evaluate and let me know but probably not on a small positive note i did receive a quick and professional response to my email but that didnt help fix my wifes jacket not satisfied never again i bought a light columbia coat and the zipper jammed with my car keys inside i had to cut the coat open to get my keys i always give companies a second chance i bought another jacket and the exact situation happened keys in the pocket i own a lot of coats cheap and nice and these are the only brand that has failed me i tried to return it and they told me to send it in postage on me and they will probably give you a new one never mind keep your bad product purchased a  backpack and after  weeks of use my fourth grade son has a giant rip at the seam they want me to return it for a repair and to pay shipping they will pay the shipping if they determine it is warranted obviously i cant wait the  weeks for my son to have a backpack i had to go and buy a jansport now i am suppose to pay  to ship it back to them and have them return a backpack i dont need or want they wouldnt even offer to pay for shipping horrible customer service for defective and poor quality bag in general ive been a big fan of columbia gear and especially their pfg line out of  pfg shirts i own or have owned i had one of my tamiami ii pfg shirts have a neck tag go bad after a hot day fishing in the louisiana summer the tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck i washed the shirt on coldcold cycle like i always do and on removing it from the wash i noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldnt come off i emailed columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed i should just mail it to the warranty dept so i did the warranty dept mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldnt cover my shirt all i want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way this is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they wont share the information i was excited to make my first purchase on this website and i was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale so i bought it on saturday eager to have it this week so i paid extra for  day shipping on tuesday the status check on the website simply said processing no eta of a delivery date or even shipping date i emailed customer service and didnt hear back so tuesday evening i called to inquire they said its  or  business days after a  day processing ok fine i would get it wed or thur wednesday came thursday came and still nothing i did finally receive a ups tracking number from them and when i tracked it i was given a delivery date of thursday but now its friday and still nothing i contacted ups and they said they still havent received the item to ship and i needed to contact the seller so now i am sitting on the phone on hold my initial wait time was estimated to be  minutes every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time but my hold time is going up instead of down now its at  minutes i still never did receive an email response from their customer service im a little stunned i thought columbia was a decent brand and the gear seems to be but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere which i will be after receiving this jacket whenever that will be i would put a big old goose egg  if i could i want to be clear that i am reviewing the company customer service here not the products the products have always been great thats why what happened to me disheartens me even more  if you order from online you should be aware that if your package is lost or in my case stolen while in transit with ups or fed ex columbia customer service becomes your worst nightmare they should call it columbia service instead of customer service because they dont treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you i placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale i tracked the package until it reached il and that is where it stopped and my headache began i called columbia c and told them that my package has not arrived by the eta and i was told that i need to wait at least  days past the eta to see if it shows up mind you they have my  they were willing and happy to take that but i had no product so i patiently waited the  days tracked the package again to the same distribution center in il i called c back and i was told that they would open up an investigation request they informed me that this could take  business days to complete so i asked if i could have a refund or could they ship me a new package i was told that this is not their policy by several other people as well in the company i was beside myself how could a company this huge treat me a great frequent customer as though it was my fault the package was lost they could have put a tracer on the package and had if found it sent back to columbia in the meantime i should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase but nooooooooooooooooo it didnt end there i wrote email after email call after call and i kept getting told that the investigation with ups was not complete i have a friend with ups access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes the notes said that they found the mittens outside of the box and the jacket was never found the jacket was marked stolen and the mittens were shipped back to c you know what i was told at this point i had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to c i cant even tell you how livid i was why do i have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest was closed and completed i finally got my money back a month after i ordered thanks columbia you lost a great customer thanks but no thanks for the offer of  off an order you are all heart horrible customer service order a jacket for son based on sizing cart indicates runs bigger turned out its smaller then sizing indicates so i called same day when receiving package asked for a exchange from small to medium and they still have other size on same color asked me to ship jacket back so mailed next day when returned and i checked tracking that return were back at columbia about  working days later called customer service and and they told me the same color dont have size left besides large bewarecolumbia customer service may not repair or replace your item but choose to give you a few dollars ecredit i asked for my item back but they recycle or donate them i did not know that was an option i should have kept my item and gotten it fixed myself now i have lost my great rain garment that looked simple to fix seams splitting all over a garment that is worn a few times seems like a manufacturing error i returned a pair of hiking boots after  months of light use the left boot sole came unglued and fell apart i had to pay  to ship them back on top of the original purchase price  weeks later i got the boots back columbia reglued them in a half assed way you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece it was a joke the letter that came back with the boots from quality control stated that the boots were out of the  year warranty period i had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than  year the boots were clearly defective and still are i threw them away because of the idiotic treatment i received i would choose any name brand before a columbia product they could have done the right thing and gained a customer but they chose to screw me nice work columbia this company sucks apparently in  i placed an order for  i returned some items as they were christmas gifts and due to columbias inconsistent sizing i had to send things back apparently now i am unable to place an order and so is everyone in my household including our apartment there are three households st this residence and a total of  different credit cards and they will not accept an order from any of them even tried using a gift card and it will not go through this is ridiculous i am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me i love that they offer good quality real sportswear in plus sizes for women their clothing is good quality well fitting and beautiful i dont live in an area with a columbia store so i order online even so i have never purchased a product from this website that i needed to return and every single time i wear a columbia garment i get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where i buy my clothes the last time i purchased a shirt from columbia my husband told me that i looked beautiful and said i should get one in each color they offered as a plus sized woman i have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hardtofit bodies charging premium prices for poor quality goods simply because our choices are scarce i cannot express how much i appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts when i wear columbia i feel comfortable beautiful and dressed appropriately for the rocky mountain region where i live i heartily recommend columbia like several other notable formerly proud and once market leading companies see rayban hoover vacuum et alsorel has been purchased for its brand cache and is systematically being transformed into a made in china or viet nam fashion focused inferior product oriented over priced corporate cash cow the heritage of quality and performance has been traded for return on investment my expensive sorels lasted exactly one hour in the subzero january temperatures that we have suffered recently in the midwest before they completely disintegrated i returned them to the factory based on the instructions provided by the customer service person at sorel and the warranty evaluator rejected my claim technically they were out of the warranty period but when you drop a buck fifty on a pair of winter boots you expect them to out perform your daughters hello kitty boots that wasnt the case if you want an exceptional pair of extreme weather boots grab a pair of us army surplus mickey mouse boots manufactured by bata they are absolutey the warmest most durable boots youll ever own and theyre available all over the internet for bout  skip the junk that columbia is cranking out in china and calling sorel i used to like columbia clothing as it was generally constructed of quality material the last two purchases have completely changed my mind i just spent  on a sweater that began to pill after just two washes the last sweater i bought turned into a giant ball of pilly fuzz within a week ill not spend another nickel on anything made by this brand i disagree with the orange head review columbia is the bees knees i bought a bugaboo parka in  from some rando sporting goods site and we had several good years together sadly the zipper died and i needed to send it in for repair just in time for a cold snap and of course i have a trip to iceland coming up as well womp womp so off to oregon it went once i saw they received it i gave them a call to check on it and explain that i kinda needed it back and was answered by a lovely woman who listened to my plight and set about helping find a solution for me she told me i was getting a replacement and we went through the options i had available to me in less than half an hour a new coat was ordered and columbia had made a huge fan out of me a spankin new coat arrived at my office today and i love it columbia stands behind its products with great customer service what more can you ask for they offer free shipping but you have to pay for returns there is not a choice to evenly exchange an item for a different size you return the item for a refund and place a new order the jacket i bought is now  times as much bought a pair of mens birke trail light weight hikers on  wore them maybe  times and the toe box failed and woretore through due to substandard suede i sent them in to columbia and they proceeded to loose them for two weeks after they received them after numerous phone calls they finally found them and i was told in late april that they would get back to me asap once they were evaluated here is it  and i had heard nothing so i called and was put on hold for  minutes while the rep looked up the info he them informed me that they could replace them and they were waiting for me to contact them not what they told me back in late april either way they dont have the shoes i had purchased so they will replace them with a similar shoe and it will be another  weeks before i get them columbia used to be a great company not any more i will buy from anyone but them in the future most likely lands end north face etc columbia sportswear unclaimed this business has not yet been

day fishing in the louisiana summer  the tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck  i washed the shirt on coldcold cycle like i always do and on removing it from the wash i noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldnt come off  i emailed columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed i should just mail it to the warranty dept so i did  the warranty dept mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldnt cover my shirt  all i want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way  this is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they wont share the information of many pfg shirts this one tag went badgot sticky  left residue that wont come off  warranty dept denied claim of many pfg shirts this one tag went badgot sticky  left residue that wont come off  warranty dept denied claim was this review … useful  funny  cool  carolyn m minnetonka mn  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow carolyn m stop following carolyn m  i was excited to make my first purchase on this website and i was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale so i bought it on saturday eager to have it this week so i paid extra for  day shipping on tuesday the status check on the website simply said processing no eta of a delivery date or even shipping date  i emailed customer service and didnt hear back so tuesday evening i called to inquire they said its  or  business days after a  day processing ok fine i would get it wed or thur wednesday came thursday came and still nothing i did finally receive a ups tracking number from them and when i tracked it i was given a delivery date of thursday but now its friday and still nothing i contacted ups and they said they still havent received the item to ship and i needed to contact the seller so now i am sitting on the phone on hold my initial wait time was estimated to be  minutes every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time but my hold time is going up instead of down now its at  minutes i still never did receive an email response from their customer service im a little stunned i thought columbia was a decent brand and the gear seems to be but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere which i will be after receiving this jacket whenever that will be was this review … useful  funny cool dawn h indianapolis in  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow dawn h stop following dawn h  i would put a big old goose egg  if i could  i want to be clear that i am reviewing the company customer service here not the products  the products have always been great thats why what happened to me disheartens me even more  if you order from online you should be aware that if your package is lost or in my case stolen while in transit with ups or fed ex columbia customer service becomes your worst nightmare  they should call it columbia service instead of customer service because they dont treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you  i placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale  i tracked the package until it reached il and that is where it stopped and my headache began  i called columbia c and told them that my package has not arrived by the eta and i was told that i need to wait at least  days past the eta to see if it shows up  mind you they have my   they were willing and happy to take that but i had no product  so i patiently waited the  days tracked the package again to the same distribution center in il  i called c back and i was told that they would open up an investigation request  they informed me that this could take  business days to complete  so i asked if i could have a refund or could they ship me a new package  i was told that this is not their policy by several other people as well in the company  i was beside myself  how could a company this huge treat me a great frequent customer as though it was my fault the package was lost  they could have put a tracer on the package and had if found it sent back to columbia  in the meantime i should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase  but nooooooooooooooooo  it didnt end there  i wrote email after email call after call and i kept getting told that the investigation with ups was not complete i have a friend with ups access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes  the notes said that they found the mittens outside of the box and the jacket was never found  the jacket was marked stolen and the mittens were shipped back to c  you know what i was told at this point  i had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to c  i cant even tell you how livid i was  why do i have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest was closed and completed  i finally got my money back a month after i ordered  thanks columbia  you lost a great customer  thanks but no thanks for the offer of  off an order  you are all heart was this review … useful  funny cool alfred k san francisco ca  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow

and fell apart i had to pay  to ship them back on top of the original purchase price  weeks later i got the boots back columbia reglued them in a half assed way you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece it was a joke the letter that came back with the boots from quality control stated that the boots were out of the  year warranty period i had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than  year the boots were clearly defective and still are i threw them away because of the idiotic treatment i received i would choose any name brand before a columbia product they could have done the

evergreen co  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow linda h stop following linda h  i am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here  columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me  i love that they offer good quality real sportswear in plus sizes for women  their clothing is good quality well fitting and beautiful  i dont live in an area with a columbia store so i order online  even so i have never purchased a product from this website that i needed to return  and every single time i wear a columbia garment i get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where i buy my clothes  the last time i purchased a shirt from columbia my husband told me that i looked beautiful and said i should get one in each color they offered  as a plus sized woman i have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hardtofit bodies  charging premium prices for poor quality goods simply because our choices are scarce  i cannot express how much i appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts  when i wear columbia i feel comfortable beautiful and dressed appropriately for the rocky mountain region where i live  i heartily recommend columbia was this review … useful  funny

a membership card of this store so he always get me things that i love the excuse hey lets check out those  off deals and surely there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhereand that matches with the color of my sunglasses impossible not to get a good deal back home i think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as outlet display at least i like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner this store lacks the wow factor but still has everything i want every time i go and service has always been good no problem needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile i was on hold for  minutes trying to see if the columbia outlet near where i live would take it since i was returning sorel shoes i hung up because  minutes is too long to wait for an answer here they were pleasant took it and give me my money back its a large store with a big selection i would definitely come here to shop if i didnt have the friends and family discount which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but i dont want to pay return shipping if it doesnt work out i have never been so upset with a company i live in the desert and i bought a coat to go to buffalo in january i purchased the coat on january  and paid extra for  day shipping it is now  days later and the coat has not arrived i was told by customer care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat i was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat i dont have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and im cold awful they close at  and we were there  to pay for a jacket we decided and they didnt let us in bad customer service and not follow the operation time lazy employee employee norman has great customer service he honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasnt coming up  but there was a sign that said  off  didnt give me any hassle and was kind and friendly i had a horrible experience here when i tried to do an exchange last week there was one rude guy in the counter doing all the returnhe constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers we went for an exchange  the guy turned us away after half hour wait even though we had all the receipts and tags keep off
