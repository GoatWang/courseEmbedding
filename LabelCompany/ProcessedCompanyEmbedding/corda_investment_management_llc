vigilant monitoring our holdings daily but not flipping securities in the shortterm what does corda do in terms of risk management we mitigate risk primarily at the time of purchase we attempt to buy at a discount as opposed to chasing shares and paying a premium as value investors we seek outoffavor and temporarily mispriced securities that have already declined in price if our timing is correct some of the price risk is taken out of the equation  we also control the amount andor the percentage of a portfolio invested in any one specific holding if something goes wrong for one of the businesses the overall downside risk to the whole portfolio is limited there are numerous ways to hedge a portfolio as conditions have warranted we have utilized a variety of securities and tools that allow us to increase protection against downside risk is your strategy tax efficient yes we are longterm investors generally our ownership in a company will last for years not months or days we want to drive results over time by owning businesses that pay dividends and in most cases have a history of raising those dividends both longterm capital gains and dividend income are taxed at a lower rate

derivativebased transactions target the risks you seek to hedge and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies  asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets  alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral properties and timber farm and ranch land are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value special risk

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free
