friday’s big news that ecommerce mammoth amazon is buying specialty grocery whole foods market is being met with optimism by the triangle entrepreneurs whose products are distributed in its stores whole foods markets inc nasdaq wfm is raleigh flipflops maker feelgoodzs largest customer says ceo mark saad feelgoodz is on track to sell more than  million to the chain in  the footwear and apparel brand made its debut at whole foods in  and is now in all of its retail locations saad is optimistic about the deal having seen “solid growth” each year at the chain “we’re excited about this development” he says in an email friday adding that from what he understands the whole foods brand will remain as is “and they will continue to bring in trusted vendors like feelgoodz” enlarge several triangle entrepreneurs sell products in whole foods which is set to be acquired… more ty wright  bloomberg he says the deal should allow whole foods to grow “rapidly” helping the chain realize a goal of plus locations nationwide in the next five years he hopes that means more shelf space for feelgoodz tatiana birgisson ceo of mati energy brewed her first energy tea batches in a duke university dorm room today cans are being sold at multiple retailers– including at whole foods birgisson is traveling abroad and heard about the buy in a text from her fiancé in an email she says “i do hope to see whole foods lean more heavily into datadriven decisions if the acquisition goes through” patrick mateer ceo of chapel hillbased seal the seasons which offers frozen local produce to retailers– including  whole foods locations says he heard about the news friday morning “my phone blew up with texts from everyone the mood seems excited and positive yet uncertain – this is new territory” he says in an email he hasn’t heard anything from whole foods but is optimistic about the deal outcome as “both organizations could learn a lot from each other and create a better food distribution system as a result of this merge” neal mctighe the raleigh entrepreneur behind nellino’s sauce company says he was also surprised to learn of the pending buyout of his retail partner “my gut reaction is a positive one as i believe that whole foods will be able to capitalize on many of the strengths that amazon nasdaq amzn presents whether it is improving grocery delivery offering prepared meals delivery or putting into place much needed supply chain improvements” he says in an email adrian larrea whose raleigh kombucha startup tribucha just secured a wider southeast distribution with whole foods predicts the deal bodes well for his firm tribucha’s first largescale manufacturing batches will be canned next week in time for a wider whole foods launch july  a former tech entrepreneur larrea points to amazon’s “incredible resources” as assets from amazon prime now to alexa “and one of the things we’re doing as a brewery is our goal to bring the prices down of high quality products” he says “that’s what amazon is all about so we’re already coming in low compared to all the other kombucha companies out there even though there are a lot that are bigger than us” initially the wider distribution deal has  percent of tribucha’s sales targeted at whole foods – but that’s now other distribution deals are in the works that will diversify that mix microsoft personalized ad preferences
