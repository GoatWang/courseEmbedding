insights log in newsletters quant fund share definition of quant fund an investment fund that selects securities based on quantitative analysis in a quant fund the managers build computerbased models to determine whether an investment is attractive in a pure quant shop the final decision to buy or sell is made by the model however there is a middle ground where the fund manager will use human judgment in addition to a quantitative model breaking down quant fund if computers can beat world champion chess players shouldnt they be able to beat the traders on wall street thats the thinking behind quant funds whose name comes from the term quantitative analysis the advantage is that computers arent swayed by emotion and they obviously react much faster than a person ever could the problem is that humans have to program those computers and even computers can make mistakes when they are programmed incorrectly remember the saying garbage in garbage out to take advantage of the power of computers you still have to figure out a superior investment strategy the term quantitative fund also doesnt tell you anything about the actual investment strategy being used any study of a company or an industry based on quantitative data can be considered a quant strategy trading center quantitative analysis quantitative trading rocket scientist qualitative analysis model risk

different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed
