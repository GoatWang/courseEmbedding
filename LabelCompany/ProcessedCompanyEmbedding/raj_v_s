tech thoughts – mostly product skip to content raj singhs mostly tech thoughts mostly product menu sxsw  messaging bots my most recent post on linkedin crossposted here ———————————— this past weekend i had the pleasure of moderating the “testing your aritificial intelligence” panel at sxsw on the panel we had dror oren from kasisto vertical messaging assistant for banking alex lebrun from facebook m horizontal messaging assistant and dimitra vergryi from sri runs the speech research lab much of our early discussion was regarding the future of assistants inpart drawing on some of my experiences from sri and tempo ai but we quickly moved to the hot topic of messaging bots and the role of ai if you’re not familiar with messaging bots i encourage you to read “the bot paradigm” from the information as well as jonathan libov’s superaggregation of messaging ux design in short messaging communication represents our primary workflow daytoday and as exemplified by applications like wechat messaging can be used to facilitate other experiences eg shopping sending money customer support this new modality has the disruptive potential of replacing all app experiences and if so would represent an opportunity as significant as the iphone app store was to publishers some panel takeaways horizontal general purpose assistants are hard users do not know what to ask nor remember what primary use case to use the assistant for in addition the technical complexity of the system is exponentially greater in that you have to deal with out of context and extreme queries for example alex mentioned they no longer intend to support “pet delivery” in fb m since that’s a use case out of their machine automation wheelhouse standalone messaging apps don’t stand a chance i found this feedback interesting in that they are advocating that messaging bot experiences need to be built upon the existing large players eg whatsapp slack facebook messenger google hangouts etc this intuitively makes sense since the app store is no longer a great growth channel app bot discovery and the ultimate app store for messaging bots is still unclear having played with the app store within fb messenger i found the workflow to be subpar alex and dror suggested displaying related app bots as you type within messenger incontext this certainly would be an improvement at  smaller scale but will remain a challenge if we have s of k of messaging bots the ultimate design of the apis that the messaging apps provide will be critical personas are necessary for messaging bots to i found this interesting in that personas can certainly lighten the mood and set expectations but can also be tiring when you want expedience see slides i presented on mobile aiux design at sxsw a previous year wish i had a video of the presentation with the voiceover machinepowered conversational nlp is a very longway out dror felt you must go vertical and thus their focus on the banking sector alex said that the fb research team described conversational nlp as level  technical difficulty and alphago as level  my fb post on the alphago ai milestone all of the panelists also acknowledged that building a data corpus collection of queriesconversation for training is the real challenge in any ai application key initial industries to be disrupted by messaging bots were financial services customer service commerce and travel not surprisingly some of these categories are identical to what we saw with early vertical siriclones in summary messaging bots represent the next growth channel and will spawn new billion dollar opportunities excited to see it happen reflecting on the productivity category my most recent post on linkedin crossposted here ———————————— having spent the last  years working in the productivity category i wanted to share some learnings from the space note everything below is slanted towards an earlystage startup ultimately selling prosumer to smb  individually vs group useful sometimes called singleplayer vs multiplayer mode but the premise is the same is your app useful to the individual or useful to a group eg workplace for example asana is useful in a group but not so much as an individual evernote is useful to the individual but not so much in a group rare apps like dropbox are both but this is not a requirement given that productivity apps typically touch personal data they are not generally viral brainstorm ways to be both individually and group useful  directtoprosumer vs topdown is your app bc or bb – the trend is to drive prosumer adoption and then to sell to the smb yammer pioneered this model xobni extended this model and in some instances it can even backfire such as when microsoft asked their employees to uninstall the xobni plugin if your app is directtoprosumer you need to think about whether you can really get to s of m of users or s of m at a really high pricepoint evernote is probably the best example and is still struggling with accelerating freemium growth with smb deployment you can charge a higher saas pricepoint plus drive more seats ideally you can achieve this without a sales team like slack and github have demonstrated but realistically you will need an inside sales team and ignoring this reality is why i’ve seen many productivity app developers fail  replacing in a category vs creating a category are you an app the smb already pays for or something they don’t yet pay for slack as an example is a new category in that smbs did not previously pay for chat however if are a “todo” app you are probably competing with an already existing tool such a jira that the smb pays for getting a company to switch tools is hard and thus why i recommend targeting supersmbs when replacing in a category  create lockin most productivity apps aggregate some cloud data files crm etc in the pim email calendar address book category we aggregated email accounts google exchange icloud being an aggregator means we are the presentation layer but without any content exclusively stored in our system the user can switch presentation layers without penalty to create lockin some options a store some content exclusively b require upfront customization such as salesforce c introduce paid this will be the best thing you can ever do and will improve all of your metrics d achieve network effect hard to pull of but if you get it hold on to it  be pervasive productivity is a lifestyle and is integrated across personal and work although mobilefirst is my recommendation don’t discount laptop usage at the workplace apps must be avail on all screens otherwise you are destined to fail  have a macro thesis product management in productivity is hard – there is no  workflows are unique to each individual and attempting to change and behave like a coach is exceptionally hard except when managed down eg everyone has to use expensify it’s best to embrace the existing workflow and improve while also maintaining a macro product thesis without a thesis your resultant app will look like the settings dialogue in office  don’t be too smart as i’ve written previously i believe predictive intelligence will be a new layer on all apps but in the productivity trust is always the  feature failing to sync an email will be an immediate dealbreaker optimize on precision accuracy vs recall  of results and ask the user when unsure versus being too smart although most contact mergers are pretty good the  out of  times they fail is why many don’t embrace product dude and mostly mobile stuff you can email

sooq lavishly naturalc natural hair diy recipes natural health  wellnessproduct review  red raj henna by henna sooq july   erica king hello beautiful a couple of months ago i was seduced by a gorgeous henna gloss bar review that had me so excited i went right to the site to get it unfortunately they were sold out of the gloss bar but not the large selection of henna products oils shampoo bars essential oils and more since i’d been having a problem with grey hair i looked at their henna selection lavish was intrigued by the red raj henna red raj is named after the region of india it comes from rajasthan it’s high in lawsone content which is the main ingredient that dyes hair it’s rich red tones or in my case totally transforming my grey situation henna sooq’s red raj henna is body art quality baq and  i placed my order on a monday i had it in my hands by wednesday night plus — it came with a free sample of a shampoo bar i love shampoo bars     naturalista word of caution be very careful when using henna it has a permanent effect on your hair and can loosen your curl pattern test a strand of your hair first to make sure you like the effects look feel texture it has on your hair   i’ve used henna and had great results i’ve also put henna on my hair and been left with strawlike strands  i missed my tight coily cottony curls and didn’t realize that my curl pattern would be affected it’s part of what led to my second big chop  don’t let this happen to your beautiful hair do your research consult a professional if you need to and  moisturize with purpose i researched how to keep my curl pattern while experiencing all the conditioning benefits of henna my search led me to a wonderful recipe from gabriellemwangi of my natural hair growth once i saw those beets i knew this was the recipe for me you know how i feel about beets the mix   grams red raj henna   beets  cup hibiscus flowers enough water to cover the beets  cover beets with water and bring to a boil once boiling turn off heat and add hibiscus let this cool until warm strain the beets and hibiscus from the tea slowly add the tea to the henna mix until the henna has a pancake consistency let sit for  hours or overnight for dye release   i mixed this with the tea i strained out all of the leaves and flowers i let this mix sit overnight in a sealed container this is what it looked like the next morning before the stir i stirred the henna and started making my amla treatment to mix in according to henna sooq’s instructions  brochure that comes with the order amla powder can be used to create browner tones give your hair great volume help maintain curly hair pattern during henna treatment promotes hair growth what is amla  amla also known as indian gooseberry is a fruit that belongs to the euphorbiaceae family a large family of flowering plants amla benefits strengthens hair roots high in vitamin c carotene and iron prevents dandruff nourishes the brain reduces hair loss improves mental functioning helps prevent greying of hair improves luster gives hair volume improves skin health increases vitality promotes healthier hair helps define natural curls   you could add amla directly to the henna or use it as a separate treatment i opted to add mine to the henna since amla powder darkens the red tones of henna dye i wanted as much red in my highlights as i could get for this i mixed in hibiscus powder with the amla if you’d like the full recipe to add amla to your henna mix see my amla  hibiscus curl defining deep conditioner recipe after this was done i added it to the henna along with  tablespoons of tea tree tingle conditioner i added vanilla essential oil and stirred one more time before applying the mix was more like cake batter and i was concerned it may drip while conditioning it didn’t thank goodness i wrapped my hair with saran wrap put a baggie over that and a plastic bag over that i then wrapped my hair with a scarf and went on about my day the henna stayed on my hair for about an hour i  rinsed it out with trader joe’s tea tree tingle   rinsing it out was easier than i expected i have very thick coarse hair so grainy things like to hide in my kinks this rinsed out well with plain water  it didn’t stain everything like some henna powders do and that was good the powder was also lighter and the henna scent which i love was also lighter with this henna the results this was what my hair looked like after the wash it was already starting to dry   i noticed immediately that there was less shedding there was hardly any hair to pick up after the wash my hair feels shinier and my curl pattern looked even more defined my curls were more elongated and they have stayed this way ever since – which i love  what happened to the grey the henna gave me a beautiful gloss that has made my hair have a deeper natural shine the grey’s are now more like a honey blonde they were more red on the first day but i do love blonde highlights  i loosely flattwisted the front and gently pulled my hair into a bun for it to dry   my hair was and is still about  weeks later soft shiny and feels like it could do a full set of pull ups feels really strong but not hard and crunchy   this is definitely my new color solution for the greys i give henna sooq’s red raj henna  stars and will definitely order from them again i still have enough for another mix so i froze the remaining henna i’ll probably do another treatment when my hair starts to cook up a few more silver strands enter to win a box  grams of red raj henna by clicking here click
