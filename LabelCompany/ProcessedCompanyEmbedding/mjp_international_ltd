proceeds from this offering competition in the newly emerging led illumination industry is quite strong and there are numerous competitors offering both led illumination products as well as alternative illumination products such as cfls there are a number of companies already active in the sale and distribution of led illumination products that are substantially larger and better funded than we are and that have significantly longer histories in the respective marketplace our principal competitors all have greater financial technical managerial and marketing resources than we have companies providing the same product or alternative products are not the only competitive factor in the emerging led illumination industry led illumination technology can be described as a destructive industry due to the exceptionally long life span of led products there will be a major reduction in maintenance cost for commercial buildings and transportation services as a result led distributors may experience market resistance from outside pressures such as labour unions who may feel their jobs are being threatened currently there are a number of companies establishing led illumination products manufacturing facilities in china this is mainly due to the relatively cheap labour force and a wellestablished supply chain system within the country mexico is currently a strong exporter to the north american lighting industry but is gradually losing market share to china as well many production facilities in europe and the united states have already shut down philips osram and general electric are currently closing down plants and will potentially cease operations entirely within the united states key competitors the led illumination industry is comprised of many players however there are four dominant multinational players who maintain well established brands distribution networks and client relationships  philips lumileds  one of the leading manufacturers of highpower leds philips has many advanced led manufacturing and operations facilities which stretch across the globe and is dedicated to increasing the adoption of solidstate illumination solutions over the last few years philips lumileds has introduced numerous led products the company also supplies core led material such as chips and wafer technology as well as led packaging and manufactures billions of leds annually  osram sylvania one of the largest manufacturers of lighting products in the world selling products in more than  countries osram makes sylvania and osram branded lighting products including leds for residential and commercial applications osram’s optosemiconductors division creates high performance leds and is involved in lighting research product designs and builds electronic control systems used to make lighting products  general electric ge a megacorporation that includes technology media and financial services operations ge is a leader in innovation the company’s products have dominated the north american market for decades however they appear to be taking a secondary role in energy efficient lighting technology this lag may be due to the company’s shortlived venture into high efficient incandescent light  cree originally an exclusively wafer manufacturer now has a led lighting division which has provided cree with key retrofit technologies that convert existing lighting fixtures to energyefficient lighting and thereby accelerate the adoption of led lighting in the general illumination market although there are some trends towards consolidation the general lighting fixture market remains largely regionally segregated and fragmented local market access in the lighting fixture industry is therefore important mjp will establish a presence in the calgary market while at the same time maintain strategic relationships with manufacturers in china by conducting the company’s product souring in china mjp aims to position itself at the forefront of this emerging competitive strategy company description mjp international ltd was incorporated in the state of nevada on october   we are a development stage company having entered into the development stage on october   founded in calgary canada we aim to capitalize on new opportunities found in the north american market for led lighting with china as the manufacturing backbone of future led products we have set up office in guangzhou china in search of high quality products offered by reputable manufacturers to be introduced to canada the united states and abroad our president and chief executive officer chris tong tang spends more than  of his time in the southern china region including guangzhou and hong kong while there he operates from our guangzhou office in addition to seeing suppliers and sourcing and inspecting products at factories he is also actively seeking to develop a market for our products in that region  on december   we entered into a share exchange agreement
