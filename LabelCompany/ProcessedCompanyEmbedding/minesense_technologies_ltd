products  minesense skip to content minesense our products our core technology is a fast scalable robust mineral sensing platform providing real time online measurement and reporting of orewaste content to a variety of customers sensing products are integrated into two distinct product lines shovelbased systems and beltbased systems mineral telemetry is delivered internally to the ore diversion system if a beltbased system or to shovel and truck operators via the ore control and fleet management system in the case of shovelbased systems comprehensively deployed minesense products combine to form the minesense solution for bulk ore recovery andor waste rejection in largescale base and precious metal mines sensors the sensor suite inside all of our products comprises high frequency electromagnetic spectroscopy hfems and high speed xray fluorescent hsxrf technologies combined with laser telemetry to measure and report ore grade in realtime sensors deliver data in arbitrary digital format to a number of customers including decision support systems such as grade control and ore routing systems or alternately large scale material handling systems which divert ore and waste in real time to the appropriate destination hfems is a penetrating field technology therefore giving volumetric grade measurement specifically in conductive magnetic or paramagnetic ore types the technology is robust g rating fast ms and flexible with multichannel and extended range options available for runofmine rom applications hsxrf is an adaptation of xray fluorescent spectrometry used for the elemental analysis of base and precious metals in runofmine materials the technology has been developed to be fast ms robust g rating flexible and scalable with multiple channels and extended range of up to mm suitable for rom applications shovelbased systems shovelsense™ shovelsense is a realtime mineral telemetry and decision support system for surface or underground applications it is a retrofit package installed in the dipper of surface shovels or into the scoop of underground machines such as scooptrams or lhd’s the shovelsense platform is used for measurement of ore quality while material is being scooped into the dipper reporting of ore quality and type to the grade controlore routing system realtime online decision support for orewaste dispatch decisions shovelsense systems interface with three key components of the production system data from the short range mine plan is read and results from telemetry are compared to the plan and updated where necessary real time ore quality readings are taken local to the shovel and transmitted over industrial wifi or g to a variety of customers including the ore control system and results of the grade measurement are compared to the plan where existing dispatch instructions are correct these are simply confirmed where existing dispatch instructions are not correct these are updated and communicated to shoveltruck and belt operators in real time the system delivers effective bulk sorting capability for lowgrade base and precious metal applications at effectively zero cost additional modalities are under development such as tramp metalmissing tooth detection integration of laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy for refractory applications hyper spectral techniques for clay and mineral alteration detection beltbased systems sortore™ the sortore system fuses highspeed multimodal multichannel sensing hfems  hsxrf  laser outputs to characterize conveyed ore and waste in real time communicating to a highspeed multichannel electromechanical diversion system ore can be diverted in bulk ie all diverters acting in concert semibulk ie single diverter channel acting or byparticle diverters act with ms response time to dispatch rocks in the ore stream to correct destinations based on sensor responses minesense believes that its proprietary electromechanical diversion systems offer lower cost and more effective diversion of coarse minerals than alternative airbased systems pilot units operating at tph are commercially available however designs for scaled systems of up to  tph are in development sortore™ logically combines with shovelsense™ systems to provide a second stage of ore recovery or waste rejection at an even finer resolution core applications are in nickel copper and other base metal sulphides and oxides such as iron ore manganese and chromite precious metal applications specifically in platinum gold and rare earth metals are under development beltsense™ beltsense™ is a sensingonly version of the sortore system incorporating multiple channels of hfems and hsxrf with laser height telemetry for particle size compensation and operating at extended range of up to mm from datum beltsense systems the grade of base and precious metal ores fast and report this grade to a variety of customers including mine dispatch and the process control system used in conjunction with a weightometer total ore value wt can also be reported instantaneous or aggregate data on ore grade is passed to the mill via tcpip for use as a process control
