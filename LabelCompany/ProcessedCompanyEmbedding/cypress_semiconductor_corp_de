customer support delivery of documents common questions about forming a c corporationif you have more questions please give us a call at   we love to helpwhat are the primary advantages of a c corporationthe c corporation structure is very similar to the c corporation with a few notable differences the most important of these differences is that c corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the irs this allows c corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income are there any restrictions on who can file to form a c corporationoutside of some statespecific regulations that require individuals to be  to own a business there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation however if a corporation decides to elect for c corporation status there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership they are as follows• all c corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the united states • c corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock • c corporation are limited to  different shareholders • subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a c corporation all shareholders must be individuals what are the tax implications of a c corporationone of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a c corporation is that the structure is eligible for passthrough taxation under this special tax status the corporation is never taxed on its income instead each individual owner is taxed on the companys profits and losses as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns are there a required number of individuals needed to form a c corporationmost states only require one director in order to start a c corporation however some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has this required number is typically never lower than three and there is no

for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate

of appeal sixth district california cypress semiconductor corporation plaintiff and appellant v maxim integrated products inc et al defendants and respondents h     decided april   attorneys for plaintiff and appellant cyress semiconductor corporation morrison  foerster arturo j gonzalez erica tate tritiam muratamiriam a vogelpurvi g patel attorneys for defendants and respondents maxim integrated products inc et al ropers majeski kohn  bentley michael j ioannoususan h handelmanterry anastassiou plaintiff cypress semiconductor corporation cypress brought this action alleging that defendant maxim integrated products inc maxim had misappropriated a trade secret or was in the process of doing so by seeking to hire away specialists in touchscreen technology a field in which cypress and maxim compete   maxim responded that it was entitled to solicit prospective employment candidates in cypresss workforce and that there was no evidence it had acquired or was seeking to acquire any trade secret   after failing to secure temporary injunctive relief and failing to obtain an order placing under seal evidence derived by maxim from public sources cypress dismissed the action   the trial court awarded maxim its attorney fees pursuant to civil code section  §  which authorizes such an award to the prevailing party where a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets is found to have been made in bad faith   cypress contends that this was error because the trial court could not properly find that maxim was the prevailing party or that cypress brought the action in bad faith   we have concluded that  the trial courts findings are free of procedural error   the finding of bad faith is amply supported by evidence that defendants did no more and cypress accused them of no more than attempting to recruit the employees of a competitor which maxim was entitled to do under the laws of this state  and  maxim prevailed when as the trial court impliedly found on substantial evidence cypress dismissed the suit to avoid an adverse determination on the merits   accordingly we will affirm the judgmentbackgrounda pre–suit eventsuncontradicted declarations established that in february  maxim was seeking to fill several positions at least some of which required experience with touchscreen technology   toward that end it engaged among others a recruiter named zion mushel who operated out of israel   on or shortly before february   mushel sent an email to a cypress employee whom the parties have identified only as “employee no   ” or “ee no  ” and to whom we shall refer as employee xx this was at least the third contact between maxim and employee xx mushel had exchanged emails with him in june  concerning an opening for a “business managerdirector touch interface products” at maxims headquarters in san jose later in january —apparently on his own initiative—employee xx had emailed a contact at maxim about an opening for an “fae” apparently meaning a field applications engineer in austin texas   now on february   mushel apparently sent employee xx an email concerning another headquarters opening  employee xx replied “i received your email about the touchscreen business manager position   my profile is up on linkedin so you can see i am certainly qualified   first question though ․ is this for maxim   i have spoken to the m previously about an opening for touchscreen business manager  ¶ let me know and we can discuss further”  ellipsis in original   mushel replied “yes its again them ¶ can you recommend anyone from cypress or others  ¶ can you recommend me  member of technical staff  mts smts pmts or scientist as well  ¶ i appreciate your help”cypress ultimately presented copies of email exchanges assertedly showing that from february through april  mushel had “solicited at least nine cypress employees who specialize in the touchscreen field”  on april   cypress president tj rodgers wrote to maxim president tunç doluca accusing maxim of “seeking to obtain cypresss proprietary information illegally by targeting cypress employees skilled in touchscreen technology”   he warned that “if maxim persists in these actions cypress will sue maxim and enjoin it from creating or distributing any products using any touchscreen expertise obtained from cypress through former employees”   this was followed by an exchange of letters and emails in which doluca disclaimed any interest in cypresss touchscreen technology while rodgers continued to insist that maxim was engaging in conduct that could lead to litigation   in a letter dated april   rodgers complained that employee xx whom he described as “a –year cypress employee with intimate knowledge of all of cypresss touchscreen trade secrets” had accepted an offer of employment from maxim   after arguing that hiring employee xx could “contaminate maxims own touchscreen intellectual property” rodgers wrote “we are currently performing an internal investigation to determine if employee xx was contacted by a headhunter hired by maxim to recruit cypress touchscreen people   if he was unlawfully recruited i will follow through on my written promise and immediately file a lawsuit to enjoin maxim from recruiting and hiring cypress employees with touchscreen expertise”   doluca replied in email stating in part that maxims offer to employee xx “was generated in march before i received your first letter   more importantly he was hired into a field applications engineering position in the us where he will not be working on touch technology at all   i will make sure he does not contaminate our touch technology”   on may  rodgers replied stating that employee xx had “chosen to remain at cypress”   he continued to accuse maxim of wrongful conduct incorporating in the letter purported facsimiles of the email exchanges between mushel and employee xx rodgers asserted that these messages directly contradicted dolucas denials by showing that mushel had “contacted employee xx for a touchscreen job”   italics and boldfacing removedb suit against mushelon may   cypress filed an action against mushel and eurika consultants eurika an israeli corporation on whose behalf he was alleged to have been acting   the complaint asserted causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets and unlawful competition   efforts to serve process on mushel and eurika were unsuccessful   eventually cypress voluntarily dismissed the complaint against themc complaint and application for temporary restraining ordercypress initiated this action on june   by filing a complaint against maxim and doluca   the allegations of the complaint are discussed in part ivb post   two days later cypress filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order prohibiting maxim and doluca from soliciting cypress touchscreen employees and requiring them to “immediately return all cypress trade secret and confidential and proprietary information that became known to defendants including specifically any list or roster of cypress employees working on touchscreen technology”   the application was accompanied by the declaration of rodgers as well as that of thomas surrette a human resources officer at cypress who described the steps taken by cypress “to protect both its technical information and employee information as confidential information”   he declared that cypress employees signed a “patent  confidentiality agreement” in which they undertook not to “improperly use or disclose cypresss proprietary information”   the agreement he asserted “applied to ․ the names skills and compensation of other cypress employees”   employees also agreed to be bound by “cypresss code of business conduct and ethics” which described “lists of customers dealers and employees” as proprietary and confidential information not to be disclosed   employees also received “training on their confidentiality obligations” including that “any data regarding cypresss ․ lists of employees ․ and the skills and compensation of cypresss employees and projects they are working on are proprietary and confidential and should not be published or otherwise disclosed”also supporting the application was the declaration of a cypress touchscreen technologist referred to as employee no   employee xx  he authenticated copies of email messages he had exchanged with zion mushel between march  and march     these reflect that mushel contacted him stating that he was looking for candidates for four positions involving “touch interface products”   employee xx replied on march  expressing a desire to “chat with mushel about the opportunity” and stating that he was qualified for two of the four positions   mushel inquired into his salary expectations   employee xx replied that for a publicly traded company he would “probably expect something north of k a year plus bonus and stock package”   mushel wrote back that the total compensation would fall in a range bracketing this figure and advising that “the positions are at maxim ¶ please keep it confidential”   he added “can it be suitable to you  ¶ can you add your experience at cypress and your touch experience ¶ can you recommend anyone  ¶ i appreciate your help”in opposition to the application for a temporary restraining order maxim manager bart decanne declared that when his business unit had job openings his practice was to forward a job description to several outside recruiters one of whom was mushel   on february   decanne told five recruiters including mushel that maxim was seeking to fill a business manager position and a product definer position   mushel inquired “what are the best companies to hunt people for these  positions”  decanne sent him a list of five companies including cypress   in response to this assignment mushel eventually provided maxim with a number of candidates “from companies on the list other than cypress as well as from companies not on the list”   one of the candidates presented was employee xx but decanne told mushel that maxim did not have a suitable opening for himmaxim also filed a declaration by one of its attorneys lael andara who described how he had identified a number of cypress touchscreen specialists by using only publicly available sources   his efforts were concentrated on linkedincom linkedin a professional networking website   he examined cypresss own page on linkedin which included a section referring to the change of one employees position from “touchscreen marketing director” to “senior member of technical staff”   a link to that persons own linkedin page revealed that it too referred to his previous “touchscreen” position   that page referred to other cypress employees including one identified as a “system engineering director”   by these and other searches on linkedin he was able to identify some  cypress employees having touchscreen or seemingly related experiencethe andara declaration was submitted both in an unexpurgated version filed conditionally under seal and a redacted version from which the names and other identifying information of cypress employees had been removed   simultaneously with its opposition to the application for a restraining order maxim moved to seal the unredacted version of the declaration on the ground that it contained “personal information concerning cypress employees” which it had withheld from the public record out of consideration for “the employees privacy rights”   maxim indicated that it had “also given plaintiffs counsel notice ․ in the event plaintiffs counsel desires to attempt to assert additional grounds warranting the sealing of the redacted employee information”the application for a restraining order was set to be heard on june     on that day the parties stipulated to and the court ordered a –day “mutual standstill” in which neither party would solicit the others employees   the court also issued a stipulated order to seal the standstill order but declared the sealing effective only for “ days subject to a motion pursuant to cal rules of court and ccp” it does not appear that such a motion was ever maded demand for identification of trade secrets  demurrer  proceedings to sealon june   maxim demanded in writing that cypress pursuant to code of civil procedure section  “identify the trade secrets that are the subject of its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets”   cypress did not respond until october   when it issued a confidential response identifying two supposed trade secrets  “ a compilation or list of cypress employees who worked with cypresss touchscreen technology and products area and their employee information including contact information” and “ cypresss substantive confidential information regarding its proprietary touchscreen technology and high performance products”meanwhile on july   maxim demurred generally to the complaint asserting that  the identities of cypresss touchscreen employees were not a trade secret because the information was publicly available   the complaint failed to allege any conduct by either defendant constituting misappropriation   no actionable conduct of any kind was attributed to defendant doluca  and  the second cause of action for unlawful business practices was preempted by the california uniform trade secret act civcode §§ –   the demurrer was scheduled to be heard almost four months later—on november  —apparently due to calendar congestionat some point maxim informed cypress that it was withdrawing its motion to seal the andara declaration   cypress then filed its own motion to seal to be heard on november  in addition to seeking to seal the andara declaration and its exhibits the motion sought to seal the declaration of employee xx   in support of the motion counsel for cypress declared that the redacted material identified “cypress touchscreen employees” which was “one of the trade secrets alleged in cypresss complaint”   maxim filed opposition contending in essence that the identities of these employees and their possession of touchscreen experience could not possibly be protectable trade secrets—or subject to sealing as such—since that information was available from and indeed had been taken from publicly available sources   cypress filed a reply in which it disputed these premises but also argued that whether or not the information was even colorably a trade secret it was required to be sealed under civil code section  which declares that “a court shall preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable means which may include ․ sealing the records of the action”   emphasizing the term “alleged” cypress argued in effect that the court could not look behind the complaints characterization of the information as a trade secret but must instead prevent any disclosure of that information unless and until it had been adjudicated by trial or summary judgment not to be a trade secretcypresss motion to seal was heard on november     at the outset of the hearing the court asked counsel for cypress to confirm that the gist of his argument was that “even though information may be accessible to the general public the fact that its being claimed as a trade secret until that issue is litigated or adjudicated youre entitled to protection”   counsel replied “thats correct”   after taking the matter under submission the court denied the motione second demurrer  dismissal  fee awardmaxims demurrer to the original complaint was never heard because on october  —the last day to file opposition to the demurrer see code civ proc §  subd b—cypress filed an amended complaint   it differed little from its predecessor  see fn  post   on november   maxim demurred generally to the amended complaint   in support of the demurrer attorney andara filed an updated declaration listing  cypress employees with apparent touchscreen experience whom he had identified from web sites and patent office recordson december  cypress filed a request to dismiss the complaint in its entirety without prejudice   on february   maxim filed a cost bill claiming    one week later maxim filed a motion for attorney fees under section  based upon cypresss “bad faith filing and maintenance of the abovereferenced action”   after proceedings described more fully below the trial court granted the motion   on june   the court entered judgment for maxim in the amount of  plus costs   eleven days later cypress filed this appealdiscussioni issues and standard of reviewsection  provides that “if a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith ․ the court may award reasonable attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing party”   application of this provision naturally raises three questions  is the defendant the prevailing party   was the claim made in bad faith   and what is a reasonable fee   cypress challenges the award here on both of the first two points denying that defendants were the prevailing parties and contending that the court erred in finding the claim to have been made in bad faith   insofar as the trial courts action depends on findings of fact we will accord them the usual appellate deference   insofar as the judgment depends on questions of law—such as the definition of “prevailing party”—we will not defer to the trial courts ruling but will address the question independently   and insofar as the ruling depends on questions as to which the trial court was vested with discretion we will disturb its action only insofar as we are able to conclude that its discretion was abusedii prevailing partythe trial court expressly ruled that maxim was the prevailing party for purposes of section    cypress attacks this ruling on two grounds  that the trial court applied an incorrect standard and that under a correct standard “there was no prevailing party”   we reject both contentionscypresss first argument is predicated on the trial courts comments concerning its finding of prevailing party status   the order granting the fee motion states in part “the court finds defendants are the prevailing party   cfcode civ proc §  subd a—prevailing party includes a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered”   cypress reads this to mean that the court treated the cited statute as providing “the governing definition of ‘prevailing party’  “ from this cypress infers a supposition by the trial court “ ‘that a litigant who prevails under the cost statute is necessarily the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees “—a premise which cypress notes has been rejected under a different fee statute  quoting heather farms homeowners assn v robinson   calappth   heather farms this interpretation of the order fails for several reasons the least of which is that it ignores the courts use of “cf” to introduce the statutory citation  “the signal ‘cf’  latin  confer meaning ‘compare with’ is used to introduce a decision here a statute that is sufficiently analogous to lend support to the proposition as where a cited case applies a similar statute”  cal style manual th ed §  p   see the bluebook  a uniform system of citation  ed §  p  “cited authority supports a proposition different from the main proposition but sufficiently analogous to lend support   literally ․compare “ nothing in the record suggests that the court felt its ruling was compelled by the cited statute   instead the court expressly cited that statute as analogous support for its conclusioncypress contends that the court should have applied the rule in heather farms supra  calappth at page  under which the governing question is whether the party seeking fees “prevailed on a practical level”   we find it far from selfevident that section  should be given exactly the same scope as the statute at issue in that case or the statutes applied in the cases cited by that court   all of those cases were implicitly concerned with the risk that a mechanical definition of “prevailing party” would produce arbitrary or inequitable results in circumstances where the party seeking fees had achieved only a superficial or illusory success   that risk will rarely if ever arise under under section  which authorizes an award only upon a finding that the action was pursued in bad faith   a statute predicating an entitlement to fees solely or predominantly on status as the prevailing party will inevitably raise the question of why a party achieving only an arguable or equivocal victory should be permitted to recoup fees from an opponent   the analogous question here is why a party who has made a trade secret claim in bad faith should be permitted to inflict the costs of defense on his or her opponent   given the manifest legislative intention to avoid such impositions the statute would seem to warrant a liberal construction of “prevailing party” trusting in the “bad faith” requirement to filter out doubtful caseswe need not finally decide the question however for we are satisfied that any reasonable finder of fact would be likely to find that maxim was the prevailing party “on a practical level”  heather farms supra  calappth at p    cypress filed a complaint that was as we discuss below meritless on its face based upon theories of liability that were not merely specious but nonsensical   the apparent purpose of the lawsuit was to cow maxim and perhaps other competitors into refraining from conduct in which—as we discuss below—they had every right to engage   cypress proceeded to lose at every subsidiary stage as well it should have   it ultimately abandoned the action rather than face a determination on the merits that would certainly have been adverse   contrary to its arguments it gained no legitimate benefit from the action practical or otherwise   at most it succeeded in notifying the labor marketplace that it would resort to spurious litigation to prevent “poaching” of its employees   since this objective is contrary to california law and policy its achievement cannot be considered the kind of success that will sustain prevailing party status or prevent an opponent from acquiring that status under section in contending otherwise cypress constructs a kind of carnival fun house in which the facts of the case are distorted into grotesque and nearly unrecognizable shapes   first it asserts that it only dismissed the action because “after the trial court erroneously denied its motion to seal” it “would have had to place its trade secrets in the public record” in order to continue litigating the matter   no part of this depiction survives scrutiny   first we perceive no error in the trial courts denial of the motion to seal   that motion rested on the premise that merely by filing a pleading characterizing certain information as a trade secret a party can compel the courts to withhold that information from the public record until such time as it finally adjudged not to be a trade secret   this premise would have considerable color where the information is at least arguably secret   here there was no arguably secret information before the court   nearly all of the information cypress sought to place under seal had been compiled by its opponent from public sources where—so far as this record shows—it has remained available to this day for anyone with the appropriate subscription to find and peruse   this was not a colorable trade secret and cypresss calling it so did not obligate the court to place it under seal or take any other action to prevent its further disclosure   the statute on which cypresss contrary argument rested obligates the court to employ “reasonable means” to “preserve the secrecy ” of an “alleged trade secret”  civcode §  italics added   here there were no means reasonable or otherwise by which the trial court could comply with this mandate because there was no secrecy to preserveother circumstances make it highly implausible that cypresss dismissal of the action was motivated by a desire to prevent the disclosure of information   first there was no reason to assume or expect that the dismissal would have that effect   had the information at issue in cypresss motion to seal been filed by cypress it would have been returned to cypress when the motion to seal was denied  see cal rules of court rule b   but the vast bulk of the information at issue had been filed by maxim   once the motion to seal was denied there was no legal basis for the materials in question to remain under seal   cypress might have been entitled to a temporary continuation of their sealed status while it sought appellate relief from that order but it sought no such relief  in the absence of such a proceeding there was no basis for cypress to assume that the materials would remain sealed   certainly the mere dismissal of the action could not be expected to accomplish that resultthe one exception to the foregoing observations is the one item filed by cypress that it sought to keep under seal  the unredacted declaration of employee xx   that document presumably was—certainly it should have been—returned to cypress upon denial of its motion to seal  see cal rules of court rule b   whether it was or not cypress proceeded to include the unredacted document in its appendix on appeal making no effort to keep it or anything else out of the publicly accessible appellate record   we are thus implicitly asked to believe that an interest so overriding as to compel dismissal of a meritorious lawsuit suddenly became too insignificant to warrant a motion in this court   we decline the request   it is impossible to construe cypresss dismissal of the action as an attempt to protect information from disclosure—even if information warranting such protection appeared in the record which it does notfinally we note that the motivation to which cypress now ascribes its dismissal of the action appears never to have been mentioned in the trial court   there cypress claimed that it dismissed the matter “because defendants apparently had ceased their efforts to obtain cypress trade secrets thus cypress achieved its primary litigation objective”   in its opposition to the fee motion cypress explained this supposed victory as follows  “after cypress filed suit defendants expressly agreed to not solicit cypress employees for thirty days and thereafter voluntarily refrained from soliciting cypresss touchscreen employees at least as far as cypress is aware   this reality operated as a de facto injunction against further threats to cypresss trade secrets   at a practical level cypress was the prevailing party because it achieved the primary remedy it sought from this court—an injunction barring any further improper solicitations by defendants”unsurprisingly the trial court was unpersuaded by this interpretation of events  nor does cypress press this perspective on appeal contending instead that “there was no prevailing party” because maxim failed to achieve its litigation objective   but maxims litigation objective like that of every defendant was to avoid the imposition of liability   the only sense in which it fell short of that objective is that cypress as it notes “retained its right to refile this action․”  but the right to file an action was hardly at the core of the case for either party   at the core of the case was maxims right to solicit cypress employees   we find a remarkable asymmetry in cypresss treatment of these points   it contends on the one hand that it did not lose the case even though it dismissed its action because it remains free to file another suit on the same grounds   on the other hand it contends that maxim did lose the case because it agreed temporarily to desist from contacting cypress employees—even though it only bound itself to that undertaking for a month and has long since been as free to contact cypress employees as it was before the suit   maxims voluntary acquiescence in a brief restraint on its conduct was nothing like cypresss complete abandonment of its lawsuit and certainly was not the “injunction” cypress prayed for which would have barred maxim—pendente lite and permanently—”from soliciting cypresss touchscreen employees”   in contrast cypresss dismissal of an objectively specious suit was an abandonment of the vociferous demands communicated at great length in presuit correspondence notwithstanding that the abandonment would not technically preclude a later suit   we have no doubt that it was sufficient victory for its adversary to support an award of fees under section seeking to establish that the dismissal was the result of circumstances beyond its control cypress suggested below that the action was dismissed because it was unable to obtain discovery from mushel   this appears to be its chief explanation for the dismissal in this court where it successfully sought judicial notice of filings in its action against mushel reflecting unsuccessful attempts to serve him with process   but the asserted inability to serve mushel hardly barred cypress from pursuing other seemingly more promising avenues of discovery much closer to home   most obviously the premise that maxim was deliberately “targeting” cypress touchscreen employees would seem more readily explored by examining maxims own employees and internal correspondence than by deposing mushel who declared—and presented email messages tending to show—that he had not been told to focus on cypress employees but had been given the names of five companies most likely to employ suitable candidates and had extended his search beyond those five companiesindeed the notion that mushels unavailability wholly thwarted cypresss prosecution of this action verges on fanciful   supposing maxim had given mushel a purloined list of cypress touchscreen employees—contrary to all indications—it had no apparent reason to tell him where the list came from or why he was asked to use it   there would have been even less reason to apprise him of a scheme by maxim to misappropriate cypresss touchscreen technology by hiring its specialists   there is simply no reason to believe that mushel would know anything about any supposed plan to “raid” cypress or to extract trade secrets from its employees  the logical place to pursue these lines of investigation was right here at home with maximthe only plausible explanation for cypresss dismissal of the action is that it feared a determination on the merits   had maxims demurrer been heard it would almost certainly have been sustained and there is no reason to believe cypress was in any position to amend its way past the pleading stage   as will be discussed more thoroughly below cypress appeared to possess no facts suggesting that maxim had done anything unlawful or was threatening to do so   the trial court could quite properly infer that the suit was dismissed to avoid what was bound to be an adverse adjudication on the merits   the lawsuit thus achieved no legitimate objective   maxim in contrast walked away with all of the rights it had when it was served with the complaint—and all the money save the attorney fees cypress had forced it to expend   the trial court did not err in concluding that maxim was the prevailing partyiii burden of persuasion as to bad faithwe turn to the question whether the trial properly found that cypress made its claim of trade secret misappropriation in bad faith   at the threshold cypress contends that the finding was marred by procedural error in that the court erroneously placed the burden on cypress to persuade the court that the action was not pursued in bad faith   this contention rests on distortions of the record   cypress first cites the courts remark to counsel for cypress at the hearing on the fee motion that “the burden is on you”   but cypress takes the remark out of context   the court had first asked counsel “where is the evidence that maxim hired mushel specifically to recruit cypress employees”   counsel alluded to a mushel email message that as counsel put it “specifically references cypress semiconductor employees as being appropriate”   he asserted that this was enough “for purposes of filing the lawsuit to ․ get to the point where we can actually get discovery and ask him ie mushel what were you doing   what information were you using   where did you get the information”   counsel remarked that if mushel had testified that he identified cypress employers by searching the internet “that would have been important information for cypress to know to determine the strength of the case in whether to proceed”it was here that the court made the comment now cited by cypress as proof that the court misallocated the burden of persuasion  “here is the problem i have with your logic   i understand what youre saying   but youre the plaintiff in the case   and youre asking the defendant to disprove a—the burden really isnt on them   the burden is on you to show that they werent doing it   presumably meaning “werent obtaining names by lawful means”   and so the fact that the defendant didnt come back and present all this evidence and we may ultimately not know doesnt meet your burden as a plaintiff in terms of having facts or evidence upon which to rely”  italics addedthese comments concern cypresss burden of proof as plaintiff in the action not the burden of persuasion on the fee motion   any doubt on that score is dispelled by the next paragraph in the transcript which cypress neglects to mention  “it kind of dovetails your argument in your papers that you were the prevailing party   i mean with all due respect i dont think you were   i think the case was dismissed without prejudice   i dont think there was any evidence in the case  ․ and i didnt take this lightly   i looked long and hard at this   there is a lot of money at issue   and its a fairly strict standard that they have to prove okay   and thats why i wanted to entertain oral argument this morning”  italics added   the “they” who had to meet a “fairly strict standard” could only be the defendants whose burden it was on the motion for fees to persuade the court that the action had been maintained in bad faith   nothing in the transcript suggests that the court misunderstood this basic pointcypress also cites this sentence in the courts order granting the fee motion  “plaintiff relies exclusively on allegations from its first amended complaint to establish merit but plaintiff fails to present any evidence to support its claim for misappropriation”   again the statement is quoted out of context   what the court wrote is “ ‘objective speciousness exists where the action superficially appears to have merit but there is a complete lack of evidence to support the claim’  citation  plaintiff relies exclusively on allegations from its first amended complaint to establish merit but plaintiff fails to present any evidence to support its claim for misappropriation”   italics added   in other words the case satisfied the quoted test for objective speciousness in that there was “a complete lack of evidence to support the claim”   the allusion to cypress as the logical party to produce such evidence is hardly enough to impeach the judgmentiv finding of bad faitha introductionwe turn to the question whether the record sustains the trial courts finding that cypress maintained the action in bad faith  “although the legislature has not defined ‘bad faith’ “ for purposes of section  “our courts have developed a twoprong standard   objective speciousness of the claim and  subjective bad faith in bringing or maintaining the action ie for an improper purpose”  flir systems inc v parrish   calappth   flir systems cypress acknowledges that the trial courts finding of bad faith must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence but it frames the question as whether “maxims evidence ․ proved objective speciousness”   that is not the test   a defendant moving for attorney fees under section  is “not required to conclusively prove a negative ie that they did not steal the plaintiffs trade secrets   instead under the ‘objectively specious standard it is enough for defendants to point to the absence of evidence of misappropriation in the record”  sasco v rosendin elec inc   calappth     further the sufficiency of the evidence to support a given finding is not tested solely by examining evidence presented by one party but raises the question whether “on the entire record there is substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the determination․  when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts a reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court”  bowers v bernards   calappd  –any question of a plaintiffs good faith must take into account and will typically begin with an examination of the plaintiffs own pleadings and such proofs as he or she may have introduced into the record   in this case as we shall see the finding of bad faith is supported by a facial examination of cypresss own complaint as well as the materials it offered in support of its applications for a restraining order and to seal portions of the recordb sufficiency of evidence of objective speciousnessobjective speciousness is said to be present “where the action superficially appears to have merit but there is a complete lack of evidence to support the claim”  flir systems supra  calappth at p    the first clause of course is superfluous  there is no logical reason to require that the action “superficially appear  to have merit”   here it is doubtful that this is the case   the original complaint which was amended only inconsequentially is a model of evasive equivocal and circumlocutory pleading   much of the complaint consists of wholly extraneous matter   many paragraphs read like a press release promoting cypresss touchscreen technology   others violate rules of pleading as old as the field codes   thus the complaint sets out in tabular form a series of factual assertions made by doluca in correspondence with rodgers juxtaposed with “facts” supposedly demonstrating their falsity   this is a pure example of pleading “ ‘the defendants pretenses’ “ which are no part of a proper complaint   witkin cal procedure th ed    pleadings §  p  quoting green v palmer   cal  amidst such dross the only colorably actionable conduct attributed to maxim is its attempt through mushel to recruit cypress employees   in the absence of additional liabilityproducing circumstances that conduct was entirely lawful  “no actionable wrong is committed by a competitor who solicits his competitors employees or who hires away one or more of his competitors employees who are not under contract so long as the inducement to leave is not accompanied by unlawful action  citations”  diodes inc v franzen   calappd    vl systems inc v unisen inc   calappth     more specifically “ ‘mere solicitation of an employee under no contract of employment to leave and associate with a competing firm is not illegal  citation  “however if either the defecting employee or the competitor ․ is guilty of some concomitant unconscionable conduct the injured former employer has a cause of action to recover for the detriment he has thereby suffered”  citation  thus if there is a “misappropriation of trade secrets as a concomitant of the solicitation” citation relief would be granted’  “ readylink healthcare v cotton   calappth   readylink  quoting hollingsworth solderless terminal co v turley th cir  fd  –cypress failed to competently allege that there had been any misappropriation of trade secrets whether “as a concomitant of maxims solicitation” of cypress employees or otherwise  readylink supra  calappth at p    the complaint hints at two distinct theories on this point  first that maxim was using trade secrets to identify cypresss “touchscreen employees”  and second that maxim was attempting to hire these employees for the purpose of gaining access to trade secrets they had learned in their work for cypress   neither of these theories appears colorable and the manner in which they were pleaded strongly suggests that cypress never had any evidence to support either of themthe first theory makes its initial appearance as an allegation that “maxim has used a headhunter to repeatedly target cypresss touchscreen employees apparently using improperly obtained confidential information regarding cypress touchscreen employees to do so”  italics added   of course an allegation that something “apparently” happened is speculative on its face   it has no place in a pleading as it is pregnant with the admission that it may not have happened at all  see long beach equities inc v county of ventura   calappd   in passing on sufficiency of complaint court disregards “speculation”   a finding that such a statement is true will not sustain a judgment in the plaintiffs favor  it is therefore not an “ultimate fact”   it may be entirely true that a magician “apparently” sawed a lady in half but proof of that fact will not sustain a claim for battery   a pleaders unwillingness to commit to an unequivocal assertion of the facts necessary to sustain a judgment is strong evidence that he or she doubts the existence of a cause of actionelsewhere in the complaint we find an allegation that “by improperly soliciting and targeting cypresss employees maxim has improperly obtained a list or roster of cypress employees working on touchscreen technology and has improperly used that information to try to poach cypress employees who have knowledge regarding cypresss advanced technological achievements in this area”   this allegation seems less equivocal than the previous one but suffers from two major deficiencies   first an allegation that someone achieved a stated result “improperly” is no substitute for allegations of specific circumstances establishing a breach of duty or otherwise subjecting the actor to liability   second the sentence is rendered ambiguous by the introductory phrase which appears to describe if rather incoherently the process by which maxim secured the “list or roster” opening the possibility that maxim compiled the list itself by gathering increments of relevant data from cypress employees or other sources   in fact of course this is precisely what mushel appears to have done   as reflected in the emails presented by cypress itself his messages to prospective candidates often included requests that for referrals to any other suitable candidates they might know   nothing in this record suggests a basis for cypress to believe let alone for a court to find such requests wrongful in themselves   a “list” compiled by mushel or maxim by such methods would also be a perfectly legitimate basis for them to search for cypress employees—and employees of other companies—who might find a place at maximnor does anything outside the pleadings suggest any basis for a belief or even a reasonable suspicion that maxim or mushel had come into possession of some sort of secret inhouse list of cypresss touchscreen employees   cypress never even directly asserted the existence of such a list let alone the circumstances making it a trade secret   at most it implied that there was an “employee roster” which cypress viewed as “proprietary” and did not “publish or share”   this roster was never tied by allegation or otherwise to any conduct by maxim or mushel   nor did cypress coherently allege or attempt to show that the disclosure of a coworkers identity by a cypress employee would constitute the divulging of legally protected information   the complaint referred at great length but with equally great ambiguity to cypresss efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential information including unspecified information concerning its employees   it nowhere stated facts sufficient to establish than an employee would violate any duty by for example telling a headhunter the mere identity of a coworker or the kind of work the latter performed as maxim vividly demonstrated it was not at all difficult to identify dozens of cypress touchscreen specialists without relying on any internal cypress information   maxims attorneys eventually found nearly  such names by searching a single website and patent records   cypress never pointed to anything creating even the appearance that mushel was using protected cypress information   in other words even the “apparently” quoted above was never substantiatedthe second theory on which cypress sought to claim misappropriation of a trade secret is that maxim was seeking to hire cypress employees “in order to acquire and use cypresss confidential information in an effort to catch up ․ in the development of touchscreen products”   this allegation is repeated several times in slightly variant forms ie that “maxim ․ has been using a headhunter to raid cypresss touchscreen employees to obtain cypresss touchscreen technology for maxim”  that “upon information and belief maxim is trying to raid cypresss touchscreen employees in order to acquire cypresss confidential information”  and that “in targeting the specific employees with knowledge of cypresss touchscreen technology maxim is improperly attempting to acquire use or disclose cypresss substantive confidential information regarding its touchscreen technology   this is threatened misappropriation․”in other words according to this theory maxim was seeking to hire cypress employees so that it could appropriate whatever trade secrets they might know   we may assume that at least some aspects of “cypresss touchscreen technology” were genuine trade secrets   it is absolutely clear however that no such misappropriation had occurred when the complaint was filed   maxim had extended an offer to one cypress employee who initially accepted but was ultimately prevailed upon to remain with cypress   so far as anything in the record suggests maxim never extended an offer to any other “touchscreen employee”   therefore it never had the occasion or opportunity to engage in the posited brainpicking   as reflected in the last sentence quoted above the claim was purely one of threatened misappropriationnothing in the complaint and nothing submitted by cypress since filing the complaint lends any color to the naked assertion that maxim was pursuing cypress employees with the object of extracting trade secrets from them   in the trial court maxim suggested that cypresss claims in this regard implicitly rested on the doctrine of inevitable disclosure under which some jurisdictions will permit a plaintiff to substantiate a trade secret claim against a departing employee “ ‘by demonstrating that the defendants new employment will inevitably lead him to rely on the plaintiffs trade secrets’   “ whyte v schlage lock co   calappth   whyte  quoting pepsico inc v redmond th cir  fd     this doctrine as maxim pointed out has been flatly rejected in this state as incompatible with the strong public policy in favor of employee mobility   whyte supra at p  citing bus  profcode §  and cases applying it   the inevitable disclosure doctrine would contravene this policy by “permitting an employer to enjoin the former employee without proof of the employees actual or threatened use of trade secrets based upon an inference based in turn upon circumstantial evidence that the employee inevitably will use his or her knowledge of those trade secrets in the new employment   the result is not merely an injunction against the use of trade secrets but an injunction restricting employment”  whyte supra at pp –cypress expressly disclaimed any reliance on the doctrine of inevitable disclosure but in the absence of that doctrine we can detect no basis for its allegation of threatened misappropriation   indeed the result condemned in whyte supra  calappth at page —”to enjoin hiring of its ․ employees without proof of any ․ actual or threatened use of trade secrets”—is precisely what cypress prayed for here  “a preliminary and permanent injunction against defendants ․ enjoiningrestraining them from soliciting cypresss touchscreen employees”   given the complete absence of any coherent factual allegations suggesting a threatened misappropriation cypresss second theory of relief was an inevitable disclosure claim or it was no claim at all—and in either case it did not state grounds for relief under california lawwe have generally directed our comments to cypresss original complaint because that pleading reflects the state of cypresss knowledge and understanding when it initiated the suit   these comments apply just as well however to the amended complaint which did nothing to supply the missing factual allegations  nor did any of the materials filed in support of cypresss position on subsequent motions add any flesh to the evasive and conclusory assertions of liability in its pleadings   we therefore cannot say that the trial courts finding of objective speciousness lacked substantial evidentiary supportc lack of express finding on subjective elementthis brings us to the question whether the trial court properly found that the “subjective” element of bad faith was present  see flir systems supra  calappth at p    cypress again opens its treatment of the question with a procedural objection ie that the court “made no finding at all about cypresss subjective belief in the merits of its case against maxim”   this contention fails on three distinct groundsfirst it is simply not true that the court “made no finding at all” on the subjective element of bad faith   the court made no express finding on that issue but we have previously rejected the proposition that a court awarding fees under section  must “state the basis for its decision”   yield dynamics inc v tea systems corp   calappth   yield dynamics    even if the rule were otherwise cypress would have waived the requirement by failing to seasonably request such a statement   see shaw v county of santa cruz   calappth   shaw    in either event where no express finding is required a reviewing court must “presume that the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment for which substantial evidence exists in the record”   id at p   see ketchum v moses   calth   quoting denham v superior court   cald   “ ‘ “all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support the order on matters as to which the record is silent and error must be affirmatively shown” ‘ “ “in other words the necessary findings of ultimate facts will be implied and the only issue on appeal is whether the implied findings are supported by substantial evidence”  shaw supra  calappth at p   see lockaway storage v county of alameda   calappth   sustaining “implicit finding” of factual basis for fee awardsecond cypresss claim of procedural error depends on yet another unnatural construction of the record   in its order granting the fee motion the court acknowledged that an award of fees required both objective speciousness and “subjective bad faith in bringing or maintaining the action ie for an improper purpose”   the court then explained in two sentences its finding of objective speciousness   cypresss entire claim of error rests on the courts failure to similarly explain its finding of subjective bad faith   the mere lack of parallel structure in the trial courts order hardly supports a belief that the court overlooked or ignored the requirement it had just explicitly acknowledged   a far more plausible explanation given this record is that the case was so redolent of improper purpose that the court deemed it both unnecessary and unduly burdensome to recite all the evidence supporting such a findingfinally cypresss references here and elsewhere to its “subjective belief in the merits of its case” are apparently intended to convey the impression that the absence of such a belief is essential to a fee award under section    the circumstances discussed above and below provided ample basis to find that cypress lacked a subjective belief in the merits of its claims   but such a finding was not necessary because the test is not what the plaintiff believed about its objectively specious claim but for what purpose it pursued such a claim  see flir systems supra  calappth at p   see sasco v rosendin elec inc supra  calappth at p  “subjective bad faith under section  means the action was commenced or continued for an improper purpose such as harassment delay or to thwart competition” if the court finds that a claim is objectively specious and that the plaintiff made it for an improper purpose there is no further requirement that the court also find a lack of “subjective belief in the merits of its case”cypresss suggestions to the contrary appear to rest on a passage in gemini aluminum corp v california custom shapes inc   calappth   where the court quoted knight v city of capitola   calappth   disapproved on another point in reid v google   calth   fn  as follows  “ ‘good faith or its absence involves a factual inquiry into the plaintiffs subjective state of mind citations  did he or she believe the action was valid   what was his or her intent or purpose in pursuing it   a subjective state of mind will rarely be susceptible of direct proof  usually the trial court will be required to infer it from circumstantial evidence’  “ both cases predated the abovecited decisions expressing the subjective element in terms of improper purpose and the case in which the quoted language originated was not decided under section  but under a statute authorizing a fee award on a finding that an action against a public entity was “brought ․ ‘without reasonable cause’ or without ‘good faith belief that there was justifiable controversy under the facts and law which warranted the filing of the complaint’” knight supra at p  quoting code civ proc §  subd a  italics added   neither case holds that a subjective belief in the merits of a claim will bar a fee award under section  if the claim was maintained for an improper purposeto be sure a genuine belief that ones claim has merit tends to show that it is being pursued for the proper purpose of vindicating a legal right honestly believed to have been infringed  see yield dynamics supra  calappth at p  italics added error to exclude evidence tending to support inference that plaintiffs principals “subjectively believed the trade secret claim had merit and were pursuing it for that reason ”   similarly a lack of belief in the merits of ones claims is strong evidence that the claims are asserted for a purpose other than the vindication of ones rights   but it does not follow and is not the case that a subjective belief in the merits will bar a fee award where an objectively specious claim is found on substantial evidence to have been maintained for an improper purposed sufficiency of evidence of improper purposeif anything the evidence of improper purpose was stronger than the evidence of objective speciousness   first the parties presuit correspondence supports a reasonable inference that the actuating motive of cypresss president rodgers was to scare maxim away from attempting to hire any of cypresss touchscreen employees under any circumstances lawfully or otherwise   in the letter commencing this exchange rodgers wrote to maxims president doluca “the purpose of this letter is to inform you that maxim is seeking to obtain cypresss proprietary information illegally by targeting cypress employees skilled in our touchscreen technology   if maxim persists in these actions cypress will sue maxim and enjoin it from creating or distributing any products using any touchscreen expertise obtained from cypress through former employees”   critically rodgers acknowledged that “ ‘this is america’ and ․ employees can change jobs when they want”   this was followed by a discourse assertedly demonstrating that “maxims motive—technology—is clear”   after boasting of cypresss superior expertise in touchscreen technology rodgers asserted that maxim had “made a ․ critical mistake in its effort to illegally appropriate our touchscreen systems knowledge   your company hired an israeli headhunter to hire our engineers—specifically our touchscreen engineers—and we have it in writing”   italics added   of course all rodgers had “in writing” were the emails from mushel to cypress employees and all those emails showed was that mushel viewed employees with appropriate experience from cypress and other companies to be “suitable” candidates for the positions he had been hired to fill   rodgers also characterized mushel as having “first recruited a touchscreen expert in our cto group through a general email to cypresscom st email attached—and then asked our employee to violate his employee agreement by giving out proprietary cypress employee information nd email”   the referenced emails supposedly attached to the letter are not included with any of the five copies of this letter in cypresss appendix so we are left to ponder fruitlessly the characterization of one of them as “a general email to cypresscom” the characterization of the second email however can be evaluated on this record  cypress never presented any concrete evidence that any cypress employee would breach any duty to cypress by furnishing any of the information mushel requestedthe final two paragraphs of the letter again threatened litigation and resulting expense if maxim did not desist from its attempts to hire cypress employees  “you might know of me well enough to know that i do not make idle threats   read it again  the next time a cypress employee working on touchscreen technology is illegally solicited or offered employment by maxim cypress will sue your company pursuing all legal remedies available to prevent maxim from stealing our ip through unlawful hiring practices  ¶․  the next person you try to hire illegally from cypress will not be cheap for your company as cypress will spare no effort or legal expense to protect its people and its technology”this letter supports an inference that the purpose of the lawsuit was to impose a financial penalty upon and thereby deter maxims attempts to hire cypress technical employees   indeed it might be inferred that the purpose of the lawsuit was to inhibit not only maxim but other competitors as well from attempting to engage in the same entirely lawful conduct   such an inference gains weight from a press release apparently issued by cypress on the day it dismissed the action   in it cypress “announced that it had dropped its trade secret lawsuit against maxim integrated products   the lawsuit charged maxim with trying to gain access to cypresss touchscreen intellectual property by unfairly targeting key cypress employees   cypress dropped the lawsuit ‘without prejudice’ so it can be filed again in the future if necessary  ¶ ‘we are well aware that our people are our greatest asset’ said tj rodgers president and ceo of cypress  ‘we will not tolerate unfair attempts to lure our employees away in order to gain access to our trade secrets   in this case maxim has been unsuccessful both in hiring our people and in making inroads in the touchscreen market allowing us to drop the suit   however we will file again if we perceive more unfair efforts to hire away our employees’   “ italics addedit bears emphasis that despite the repeated references to “unfair”—not illegal—hiring practices cypress at no time pointed to any information whatever tending to show that maxim was doing anything more than seek the most qualified candidates for openings in its own enterprise   it is of course true that any technicians hired from cypress might possess trade secrets they could not lawfully share with their new employer   but as rodgers himself wrote to doluca hiring such employees posed an inherent risk to maxim as well   if maxim succeeded in engaging cypress employees laden with such secrets he wrote it would run the risk that they might “contaminate your touchscreen products with an ip liability”   when he specifically linked this risk to maxims potential hiring of employee xx doluca acknowledged the risk but deemed it manageable writing that employee xx would “not be working on touch technology at all” and adding “i will make sure he does not contaminate our touch technology”   in continuing to insist that the mere attempt to hire that employee and others warranted judicial relief cypress is revealed as relying entirely on the generic risk that employees knowledgeable in a given specialty may give a new employer the benefit not only of their expertise but also of trade secrets acquired in a previous employment   as previously noted this is a de facto invocation of the “ ‘inevitable disclosure’ “ doctrine which courts in this state have rejected  flir systems inc v parrish supra  calappth    whyte v schlage lock co supra  calappth  the trial court was also entitled to conclude that the litigation was conducted in a manner calculated to magnify maxims legal expenses by impeding the progress of cypresss own lawsuit while employing tactics that were discourteous and inconsiderate at best and vexatious and oppressive at worst   for example cypress waited to amend its complaint until the last day on which it could have filed opposition to the demurrer interposed by maxim nearly four months earlier   as previously noted the amended complaint added nothing of substance to its predecessor   yet its filing required maxim to demur a second time and delayed any determination on the legal sufficiency of the pleading for another four monthsan inference of dilatory and oppressive intent is also supported by cypresss belated and evasive response to maxims demand for specification of the trade secrets at issue   as counsel pointed out cypress was not entitled to withhold a definitive statement of the alleged trade secrets until some later time   he cited perlan therapeutics inc v superior court   calappth   where the court wrote that a party was not entitled to describe a trade secret so vaguely as to amount to an openended work in progress  “ ‘if perlan does not know what its own trade secrets are’ “ the court wrote “ ‘it has no basis for suggesting defendants misappropriated them’  “ the court below could quite reasonably conclude that this language aptly described cypresss claim herefurther similar evidence appears in cypresss responses to discovery   on december   counsel for maxim sent a “meet and confer” letter to opposing counsel protesting among other things an objection to an interrogatory as “vague and ambiguous” when it asked cypress to “ ‘identify’ what you allege in the complaint to be ‘confidential’ and a ‘trade secret’   “ in response to a interrogatory seeking the basis for its asserted belief that maxim had misappropriated or misused cypresss touchscreen technology cypress had written that it was “in the process of investigating and compiling documentation regarding its allegations in its complaint”   as counsel correctly observed this was “in effect an admission that there are no facts or documents that support the claims in the complaint”   cypress also apparently refused to provide discovery concerning “how cypress protects its confidential information as well as how it recruits potential employees”naturally these tactics necessitated considerable effort by opposing counsel who declared in support of the fee motion that his office had prepared a motion to compel discovery when it became aware of the dismissal of the action   this occurred counsel for maxim declared when he learned—along with the rest of the world—about cypresss press release   a mere three days earlier counsel for cypress had written to him suggesting that they meet in about two weeks to discuss the longbrewing dispute over cypresss failure to make discovery   counsel for cypress made no apparent effort to notify maxim of the dismissal and indeed did not send a copy of the dismissal until five days after it—and the press release—were promulgatedfinally the trial court was also entitled to take note of the transparent unsoundness of cypresss generation of further litigation—and litigation expense—through its transparently unsound attempts to seal a compilation of cypress touchscreen technicians prepared by maxim ie its attorneys from public sources   admittedly maxim itself generated some early confusion by seeking to file this information under seal   once it abandoned that effort however it had to be clear to cypress and its counsel that nothing in the record could overcome the presumption in favor of public accessibility in court proceedingsin sum the record amply supported the trial courts implied finding that the action was maintained for an improper purposedispositionthe judgment for fees is affirmedfootnotes   mushels initial february  email does not appear in the record   instead cypress presented what appears to have been his june  message to employee xx the initial february message was probably similar to this  his opening messages all tended to take substantially the same form which the june  message exemplifies  “im a global head hunter․  ¶ can you help me  ¶ im looking for successful leading st tier semiconductors company for  ¶ business managerdirector touch interface products ¶ must have experience as touchscreen applications business managertechnical marketing product manager plm ¶ location is in the silicon valley ca ¶ package is very attractive    ¶ people from cypress are very suitable ¶ are you interested  ¶ can you recommend anyone  ¶ i appreciate your help”   since all identifying information has been redacted from these messages it is impossible to verify the number of recipients   in addition to omitting mushels initial february message rodgers omitted an important part of employee xxs message of june     the employee had written “who is the company looking   i may have talked to them already”  italics added   the second sentence does not appear in the purported facsimile of the message contained in rodgerss letter   of course elementary logic tells us that an assertion that a candidate was “contacted” for a “touchscreen job” does not contradict a statement that he was offered a nontouchscreen job   in fact it appears that both happened—mushel indeed contacted employee xx for a touchscreen position but the position actually offered was the fae position about which employee xx had inquired on his own initiative three weeks before mushels contact   the employee was originally named only in sealed versions of the supporting materials   however cypress included unredacted versions of these materials in its appendix on appeal   we will nonetheless refrain from naming this employee to maintain consistency with our treatment of employee xx   maxim also described the mushel declaration as containing redacted material ie the “nonexclusive list of companies provided to mr mushel”   the only version of that document in the record on appeal contains no such redaction   the cited statute provides “in any action alleging the misappropriation of a trade secret under the uniform trade secrets act ․ before commencing discovery relating to the trade secret the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the trade secret with reasonable particularity․”  code civ proc §    an order sealing or refusing to seal documents is appealable as an order on a collateral matter  mercury interactive corp v klein   calappth     had cypress been prepared to demonstrate the inadequacy of appeal as a remedy it could have sought an extraordinary writ  see eg copley press inc v superior court   calappth   people v superior court   calappth   nbc subsidiary knbc–tv inc v superior court   calth    nor does an inference adverse to maxim arise from mushels supposed evasion of service   rodgers himself provided ample motive for that conduct by demanding in presuit correspondence that mushel identify all cypress employees he had contacted   mushel later explained in a declaration that his business depended on being able to contact potential candidates in confidence and a breach of that confidence—as demanded by rodgers—would impair his ability to earn his livelihood   this was an apparent reference to mushels statement in an email to employee xx that “people from cypress are very suitable”   the fact that cypress touchscreen specialists would be “very suitable” for some jobs at maxim seems selfevident  at any rate it hardly indicates that mushel or maxim was singling out cypress workers   indeed the contrary is immediately apparent from a second message to employee xx in which mushel asked “can you recommend anyone from cypress or others ”  italics added   similarly in his boilerplate solicitations to other cypress employees including employee xx mushel wrote “people from cypress etc are very suitable”  italics added   thus even without the uncontradicted evidence later presented by maxim showing that cypress employees were not singled out for recruitment it was obvious from the very emails cited by rodgers that mushel was seeking potential candidates wherever they might be found   apart from a reference to “lists of ․ employees” the complaints most specific description of supposedly confidential employee information is a reference to “the names skills and compensation of other cypress employees”  italics added   but the extent to which this information was actually deemed confidential is not disclosed  the complaint states only that these matters were among the things to which a confidentiality agreement “applied”  how it applied or what exactly it said about them was never disclosed   further the combination of “names” with “compensation” invites suspicion since the conjoining of pertinent but untrue allegations with true but irrelevant ones is a timehonored device of the equivocal pleader   salary information unlike the mere names of employees has long been recognized as potentially sensitive in a competitive labor market  see bancroft–whitney co v glen   cald  – corporate officer breached fiduciary duty by supplying competitor with salary and other information concerning employees considered most desirable for hiring by new enterprise  id at p  unpublished “list of salaries” constitutes “confidential information” such that “an officer of a corporation violates his trust if he reveals it to a competitor for the purpose of enabling the solicitation of the corporations employees by the competitor”   but there is no indication that maxim had any inside information about either the names or salaries of cypress employees   the only evidence bearing on that subject is mushels asking a cypress employee about his own “salary expectations” with reference to an opening at maxim  “it requires little talent to distinguish between a situation in which an individual voluntarily discloses his own salary to another and one in which the unpublished salary list of a group of prospective employees is revealed to a competitor for the purpose of facilitating the recruitment of the corporations personnel”  id at p    as far as we can tell the amended complaint differed in the following respects   maxim was alleged to have solicited  rather than nine cypress employees   a new paragraph alleged that maxim had admitted engaging mushel “to solicit touchscreen employees on behalf of maxim”   another new paragraph alleged that after learning its employees had been identified on social web sites cypress “clarified its written policy regarding such publications” and rodgers wrote to the identified employees warning them against “disclosing confidential information on social websites”   the phrase “at least” was inserted into several paragraphs stating how many confidential memoranda some of the solicited employees had written   a new paragraph stated that the tenth solicited employee had “also written confidential memoranda during his tenure at cypress”   a paragraph alleging that maxim committed acts of unlawful competition was modified to state that “defendants” committed such acts  and  an enumeration of these acts was expanded to include “mr dolucas repeated denials and misrepresentations ․ as alleged above” referring to his supposedly false statements in correspondence with rodgers   rodgerss also wrote that “all of the potential excuses about our touchscreen employees first contacting maxim or being hired by coincidence or by friends at maxim are preempted”   insofar as this was meant to suggest that no cypress employee had initiated any of the contacts in question it is yet another instance of trying to invest evidence with a meaning contrary to its plain import   the second earliest correspondence shown by this record is an email from employee xx to mushel dated june   asking “who is the company looking   i may have talked to them already”   the record does not disclose whether he was referring to a prior contact with maxim but it is clear that he had made prior contact with some potential employer   even more tellingly two weeks before the solicitations precipitating this lawsuit employee xx had written to a contact at maxim—apparently a personal acquaintance—expressing interest in a position in austin   it thus appears that cypresss flagship example of supposedly improper solicitation involved a worker who had made at least one prior inquiry into employment at maxim and quite possibly two on his own initiative   rodgerss assertions to the contrary fly in the face of the very correspondence cited by himrushing pj

customer support delivery of documents common questions about forming a c corporationif you have more questions please give us a call at   we love to helpwhat are the primary advantages of a c corporationthe c corporation structure is very similar to the c corporation with a few notable differences the most important of these differences is that c corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the irs this allows c corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income are there any restrictions on who can file to form a c corporationoutside of some statespecific regulations that require individuals to be  to own a business there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation however if a corporation decides to elect for c corporation status there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership they are as follows• all c corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the united states • c corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock • c corporation are limited to  different shareholders • subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a c corporation all shareholders must be individuals what are the tax implications of a c corporationone of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a c corporation is that the structure is eligible for passthrough taxation under this special tax status the corporation is never taxed on its income instead each individual owner is taxed on the companys profits and losses as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns are there a required number of individuals needed to form a c corporationmost states only require one director in order to start a c corporation however some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has this required number is typically never lower than three and there is no

according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or
