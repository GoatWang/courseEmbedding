this years program by anna hensel anna hensel is an assistant editor at inccom she is a recent graduate of creighton university and her work has appeared on espncom and silicon prairie news ahhensel assistant editor incahhensel write a comment walt disney company ceo bob iger credit getty images after raising a  million series b round last june littlebits a fiveyearold startup that makes electronic building blocks wanted to find a way to increase its international reach so it took an unusual step for a startup of its size it applied to an accelerator but not just any acceleratorthe one run by the international juggernaut that is the walt disney company it was a nobrainer for littlebits ceo ayah bdeir explainsit currently sells its product in  countries and works with more than  schools littlebits is a company thats universalit crosses boundaries of nationality language age and space bdeir says earlier this week disney announced the list of startups that made it into the  class of its accelerator program now in its third year but this year the media giant took a sharply different approach when handing out the muchcoveted golden tickets  for one thing the companies that disney selected are biggerthe list includes startups that have already raised tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital such as littlebits vr startup jaunt and opennetwork publishing platform playbuzz additionally disney is no longer capping the amount of money it invests in each startup at  which it had done for the past two years reports techcrunch disney also declined to renew its contract with techstars which had helped run the accelerator for the past two years a techstars spokesman told inc were glad to see their disneys ongoing commitment to innovation through their own accelerator program and we continue to fully support our alumni from past programs with them disney declined to reveal how much it invested in each startupbut with bigger companies involved one can imagine that the investments are much larger the accelerator is taking a different direction michael abrams the senior vice president of innovation at disney acknowledges we realized that we had the opportunity this year to leverage the disney accelerator framework and apply that to a much broader array of innovative companies with or without startups disney has plenty of resources at its beck and call to develop new technology the company has multiple departments dedicated to creating cool new gadgets in the past year for instance disneys research department has worked with other organizations to develop smart paper that can react to gestures and a robot that can walk up walls  but as startups like oculus and spacex continue to dominate headlines for their breakthroughs in virtual reality and space transportation the company responsible for the first animated featurelength film and the first multiplane camera can no longer rely on inhouse creations to stay innovative and as this weeks newest viral sensation pokémon go proved using popular corporatecreated characters to introduce innovative new technology can be fruitful the game is the result of a collaboration between software startup niantic and the nintendo company disney remains tightlipped about what the accelerator entails for this years cohort but it seems that the program is primarily focused on building relationships with disneys executive team and teaching startups how to reach more markets in the media and entertainment fields  artificial intelligence startup statmuse which created a natural language processing platform to help sports fans search for player stats made it into disneys accelerator program last year it was a transformative experience for the then oneyearold startup it had only three employees at the time and had yet to raise any money the company closed a  million series a round shortly after finishing the program which enabled it to operate without a paywall and to launch the first public version of its product it also signed a deal with walt disneyowned espn to provide statistics during the  nba season we went from getting ready to charge fantasy players to research to realizing that theres significantly more that we can do with our platform statmuse ceo and cofounder eli dawson says  with disneys new focus on laterstage companies its unlikely that future disney accelerators will include cinderella stories like statmuse instead get ready to see wellknown upandcoming tech companies pulled under the disney umbrella  correction an earlier version of the story misstated the timing of when statmuse raised its  million series a round it was shortly after finishing disneys accelerator program published on jul   international accelerator inc
