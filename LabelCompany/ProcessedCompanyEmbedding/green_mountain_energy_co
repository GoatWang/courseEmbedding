recommendations on consumeraffairs compare companiesare you this business learn about consumeraffairs for brandsconsumer complaints and reviewswill of atascocita tx on july  consumer increased ratingi concluded my month residential electricity contract with green mountain energy company on june   i needed a letter of credit from green mountain to avoid paying a deposit to my new provider i called green mountain and requested the letter i received the letter on june   and it stated that i had two late payments in the previous twelve months this came as a surprise to me considering i was on autopay with green mountain and my monthly bills were submitted to my chase visa routinely without incident i spoke with a representative from green mountain on june   to resolve this issue the green mountain representative informed me that my july bill was due on august th and chase paid it on august th and my september bill was due on october th and chase paid it on october th thus my letter of credit stated i had two late payments the green mountain representative suggested i contact chase about this apparent discrepancy and she refused to remove the two late payments from my letter later that day i spoke with a representative from chase visa and was told that they only have a record of the process dates  and  and no errors were recorded as a consumer i feel i am at a distinct disadvantage because i cannot prove when these requests for payment were actually made by green mountain this seems like a simple matter that could be resolved with little effort both bills were paid and i had no control over when green mountain submitted themhelpfulyesnolynette of laurel md on june  consumer increased ratingi signed up with green mountain energy at a sears near me because i wanted a less expensive rate than bge it was sometime last year there seemed to not be any problems with my account until i received the june bill from bge i was charged  for bge electric delivery i sent an email to green mountain to cancel and to switch me back to bge i received a response stating that they will i am so sorry for those who associated themselves with this company i hope all issues will be resolvedhelpfulyesnomichael of houston tx on june  satisfaction ratingi talked to a green mountain sales person at a trade show he fed me the sales pitch i told him i was only interested in more information not switching he asked for some basic info which he entered into a tablet a few days later i get a card in the mail saying i have authorized switching my energy account over to green mountain i call in to let green mountain energy know i did not authorize the switch the customer service reps give you a run around type confirmation i called back to make sure i was not switched then i am told i will be returned to my original provider after two business cyclesthe sales person i spoke with is jay  he lied and he is crooked i think the entire organization might be crooked dont walk away from green mountain energy and their renewable and affordable service run and learn from my mistake dont give out personal info at trade show booths or to any sales people at stores events etchelpfulyesnoshannah of houston tx on june  satisfaction ratingon may th  i went to the houston pet expo and stopped to chat with green mountain energy the representative told me they had a promotion going on he wanted to know if i was interested in switching providers i was interested and told him i was on contract with my current provider until  he extended their promotion took down my information and said i had until  to join with them then i received an email the next day talking about the promotion in the subject title i never opened it until today when i wanted to investigate their rates now that my current contract is expiring soonthat ahole he signed me up for their service to begin  i dont know even know how that is legal or possible i signed no paperwork other than entering my contact information i called and canceled i didnt seem to have any problems with that i did demand that they email me proof of my cancellation i havent received it yet but ill never in my lifetime mess these con artists again if i hadnt finally read that email id be paying double electric companies wthhelpfulyesnorobert of harlingen tx on june  satisfaction ratingi was

they will say you are saving environment by using green energy blah blah and then suddenly they will increase the rate and if you do not notice your bills then you are paying high rate and they will not refund single penny alsohelpfulyesnoisaactracey of severna park md on may  satisfaction ratingi was approached by a representative from the green mountain energy co while shopping in a kmart store i listened to what the girl had to say and said no several times i didnt want to change anything with my current carrier i expressed my concern about my bill getting all screwed up and told her that is why i didnt want to do any changes i was reassured that nothing was going to change on my bill it would be exactly the same just my supplier i got my electric bill today and just as i was afraid of happened my bill is over a  dollars more i called the company and was told that its because i have budget billing i am very disappointed that the girl never once mentioned anything about the way the billing would be if i was on budget billing i think that is something very important the representatives need to mention when they are asked several times is anything going to change with my bill i am on budget bill for a reason and to have a surprise extra  show up on my bill doesnt make me very happy i have since cancelled with them and plan on filing a complaint with the company as well i hate being lied to i would have never done the change in the first place if i knew this would happen because of being on budget billing i will be sure to let everyone know that i can not to go with them i was lied to just to get me to change this is very misleading and wrong to take advantage of people this way and catch them while at a store and a lot of people are in a rush as i was that day i was told it does mention the budget billing in the paper work but i didnt even think about looking for that because i was reassured several times nothing was going to change on my bill just very disappointedhelpfulyesnonorma of alice tx on jan  satisfaction ratingthis company took advantage of an  year with dementia they lied about giving her a lower bill   bill credit the con man that went
