closedend management investment company investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by mlps mlprelated entities and other energy and utilities companies it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries including high interest costs high leverage costs the effects of economic slowdown surplus capacity increased competition uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors the fund invests in securities of nonus issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers because the fund invests in nonus securities you may lose money if the local currency of a nonus market depreciates against the us dollar use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings not fdic insured • not bank guaranteed • may lose value   the
