scripps with his cousin john sweeney and other family members founded his first newspaper the cleveland penny press scripps had  in capital and owned  percent of the paper the rest was owned by his halfbrothers george henry and james edmund scripps—each of whom received  percent stakes in the company—and other partners ew scripps was a populist who thought that most newspapers were geared towards the rich he wanted his newspaper to keep the poor informed through short simple stories that could be understood by those without extensive education he got many of these ideas from james e scripps an english immigrant who started the detroit evening news in  ew also added his interest in personal stories to the mix later giving a raise to an editor who published the fact that he had been fined  for riding a horse while intoxicated at the time the cleveland penny press was founded most newspapers had a party affiliation they also sold for more than a penny and many contemporaries were skeptical that the press would succeed ew scripps formula proved successful however and within weeks the cleveland penny press had a circulation of approximately  it was not a profitable operation however until james e scripps ordered ew to run the paper for  a week as soon as the penny press was making money ew persuaded his brothers to buy the st louis chronicle he then spent a year in st louis managing the paper ew bought a  percent interest in the penny post —part of which was already owned by james e—went to cincinnati to manage it and changed the papers name to the cincinnati post he subsequently began taking on political corruption and winning circulation from  to  james e scripps was in europe receiving medical treatment while ew managed the detroit news although ew expanded advertising and circulation james e was angry with the changes his brother made upon his return james e removed ew from every position he could in  ew started his own paper the kentucky post in covington across the ohio river from cincinnati also in  ew scripps entered into a partnership with his business manager milton mcrae the two called their newspaper company the scrippsmcrae league mcrae handled daytoday management of the papers and received onethird of the profits while scripps set editorial guidelines and longterm policy in  with his business running smoothly scripps began building a ranch outside of san diego california in  george scripps joined scrippsmcrae this gave the group a controlling interest in the cleveland press later in the s the group started the akron press and kansas city world as his chain expanded ew scripps chose young growing towns to start new newspapers he invested as little in machinery or plants as possible usually buying old presses and renting rundown buildings he would then hire young ambitious editors who were given a minority stake in their paper many of them became rich if their newspapers succeeded with ew scripps spending most of his time in california mcrae often exceeded his authority and put editorial pressure on newspaper editors scripps would periodically venture out of california discover what mcrae was doing and reverse it scripps next began a series of west coast newspapers unassociated with the scrippsmcrae league group they included papers in los angeles san francisco fresno berkeley and oakland california as well as seattle tacoma and spokane washington in  george scripps died leaving his stock to ew james e scripps contested the will however and james e and ew settled out of court ew was forced to give all of his stock in the detroit newspapers to james e who in return gave ew all of his stock in newspapers outside detroit in  scripps started the newspaper enterprise association nea a service for exchanging and distributing illustrations cartoons editorials and articles on such specialized subjects as sports and fashion newspapers in the scripps chain paid a monthly fee and received information and illustrations none of them could have afforded individually although the nea was originally only for scripps papers demand for its services was so great that it soon became available to any newspaper in  scripps entered another period of expansion buying or starting papers in denver and pueblo colorado evansville and terre haute indiana memphis and nashville tennessee dallas texas and oklahoma wire service in the early s in  scripps combined the nea the scripps mcrae press association and publishers press into the united press association wire service in order to provide  words of copy a day by telegraph to  subscribers in the united states a similar service the associated press ap already existed and was far larger and better financed scripps viewed ap as monopolistic and too close to the establishment and deliberately set out to oppose it ap was also geared toward morning newspapers while most of scrippss were evening newspapers scripps therefore had each of his papers send out stories from their area during the day and combined them with information gathered at offices set up in important news producing cities such as washington dc and other world capitals in  ew scripps retired from active management appointing his son james g scripps chairman of the board during world war i ew was a passionate advocate of us intervention on the side of the allies and moved to washington dc to push his cause shortly thereafter a family crisis erupted during which scrippss son james detached the five west coast newspapers and the dallas dispatch from the chain in  united press caused a storm of controversy when it reported the end of world war i four days before it actually ended ew scrippss health started declining during the war and by its end he was largely living on his yacht in  he gave direct control of the chain to his son robert and roy w howard and in  incorporated all of his stock news services and newspapers into the ew scripps company based in cincinnati the profits went to the scripps trust set up for his heirs despite his semiretirement scripps had the energy to direct a last burst of expansion in the s he made roy howard chairman and

find their own way at the time of ew scrippss death in  the scripps howard league was the second largest newspaper chain in the united states after william randolph hearsts ew scripps was one the most successful newspaper owners of the era of the socalled press barons because of his reclusive personality though he was one of the least known he stood up for the working class but in many ways despised them in addition he encouraged his newspapers to crusade for female suffrage but considered women inferior to men in all scripps started  newspapers some of them did not stay in business long some were unsophisticated but remained fiercely independent their emphasis on human interest stories was welcomed by new immigrants who had lost their former communities roy howards stock holding in the company was small but with his strong personality he influenced the scripps heirs and took working control of the company managing it as if it were his own and bringing his own family into the company hierarchy in  scripps howard bought the new york telegram four years later it purchased the new york world and merged the two newspapers into the worldtelegram in  howard gave up his position as chairman of the chain and became president in the s united press built a network of bureaus in south and central america and in the far east though its coverage was weaker in europe and it remained smaller than ap also that decade the newspaper chain began to shrink as lessprofitable papers were sold or consolidated and sixday evening papers began to lose their appeal during world war ii ernie pyle came to fame as a scripps howard columnist reporting from the european battle theater before losing his life on a pacific battlefield postwar growth after world war ii scripps howards sales grew dramatically from nearly  million in  to more than  million in  and  million in  profits however were not increasing due to the rising cost of labor newsprint and printing machinery profits were hovering around  million according to forbes magazine in  ew scrippss grandson charles e scripps became company chairman at the age of  and roy howards son jack r became company president at the age of  by this time scripps howard had  newspapers with a total circulation of four million the company was also expanding into broadcasting and owned radio and television stations in cleveland and cincinnati as well as in knoxville and memphis tennessee the scripps family trust still owned nearly  percent of the company management was decentralized with general operations conducted in new york

gained five percent ownership of upi but most former international news service employees were laid off also that year scripps bought the cincinnati timesstar and merged it into the post giving the company control of all of cincinnatis daily newspapers the cincinnati enquirer —which had been acquired in —was carefully kept separate from the other papers to diminish possible charges of a monopoly in  however the us department of justice accused scripps howard of owning a monopoly and ordered it to sell the enquirer the enquirer was far stronger financially but the trusts lawyers advised the firm that it would be better off selling it rather than trying to sell the post in the meantime scripps continued building its broadcast division buying wptv in west palm beach florida for  million in  in  the broadcast properties were taken public under the name scripps howard broadcasting company the initial offering quickly sold out leaving the ew scripps company with twothirds ownership roy howard died in  one of the problems jack howard—who had succeed roy howard as president in —faced was that the company was still run for the beneficiaries of the ew scripps trust and the trustees lawyers sometimes had a large role in significant corporate decisions more importantly with the rise of television after world war ii evening newspapers across the united states found their circulations declining people read the newspaper in the morning and watched the news on television in the evening in addition management of scripps had become so conservative that critics charged it had no longrange plans and did little beyond preserve its assets more and more scripps newspapers took advantage of a law that allowed newspapers in danger of failing to partially merge with stronger rivals keeping only editorial departments separate by   of the  remaining scripps dailies were in such arrangements a higher percentage than any other major chain in  jack howard retired as president

financial data but the wall street journal cited its sales at approximately  million in  the ew scripps company began looking for a buyer for upi estlow said that part of the reason was the possibility that the beneficiaries of the scripps trust fund might bring legal action forcing the closing or selling of the wire service in  the firm found a buyer for upi media news corporation a private firm started for the purpose of buying upi which had  bureaus and  employees the purchase price was not disclosed but industry analysts felt it could not have been much more than the value of

was a populist who thought that most newspapers were geared towards the rich he wanted his newspaper to keep the poor informed through short simple stories that could be understood by those without extensive education he got many of these ideas from james e scripps an english immigrant who started the detroit evening news in  ew also added his interest in personal stories to the mix later giving a raise to an editor who published the fact that he had been fined  for riding a horse while intoxicated at the time the cleveland penny press was founded most newspapers had a party affiliation they also sold for more than a penny and many contemporaries were skeptical that the press would succeed ew scripps’ formula proved successful however and within weeks the cleveland penny press had a circulation of approximately  it was not a profitable operation however until james e scripps ordered ew to run the paper for  a week as soon as the penny press was making money ew persuaded his brothers to buy the st louis chronicle he then spent a year in st louis managing the paper ew bought a  percent interest in the penny post —part of which was already owned by james e—went to

receiving medical treatment while ew managed the detroit news although ew expanded advertising and circulation james e was angry with the changes his brother made upon his return james e removed ew

and longterm policy in  with his business running smoothly scripps began building a ranch outside of san diego california in  george scripps joined scrippsmcrae this gave the group a controlling interest in the cleveland press later in the s the group started the akron press and kansas city world as his chain expanded ew scripps chose young growing towns to start new newspapers he invested as little in machinery or plants as possible usually buying old presses and renting rundown buildings he would then hire young ambitious editors who were given a minority stake in their paper many of them became rich if their newspapers succeeded with ew scripps spending most of his time in california mcrae often exceeded his authority and put editorial pressure on newspaper editors scripps would periodically venture out of california discover what mcrae was doing and reverse it scripps next began a series of west coast newspapers unassociated with the scrippsmcrae league group they included papers in los angeles san francisco fresno berkeley and oakland california as well as seattle tacoma and spokane washington in  george scripps died leaving his stock to ew james e scripps contested

detroit in  scripps started the newspaper enterprise association nea a service for exchanging and distributing illustrations cartoons editorials and articles on such specialized subjects as sports and fashion newspapers in the scripps chain paid a monthly fee and received information and illustrations none of them could have afforded individually although the nea was originally only for scripps papers demand for its services was so great that it soon became available to any newspaper in  scripps entered another period of expansion buying or starting papers in denver and pueblo colorado evansville and terre haute indiana memphis and nashville tennessee dallas texas and oklahoma united press association wire service formed in  in  scripps combined the nea the scripps mcrae press association and publishers press into the united press association wire service in order to provide  words of copy a day by telegraph to  subscribers in the united states a similar service the associated press ap already existed and was far larger and better financed scripps viewed ap as monopolistic and too close to the establishment and deliberately set out to oppose it ap was also geared toward morning newspapers while most of scripps’s were evening newspapers scripps therefore had each of his papers send out stories from their area during the day and combined them with information gathered at offices set up in important news producing cities such as washington dc and other world capitals in  ew scripps retired from active management appointing his son james g scripps chairman of the board during world war i ew was a passionate advocate of us intervention on the side of the allies and moved to washington dc to push his cause shortly thereafter a family crisis erupted during which scripps’s son james detached the five west coast newspapers and the dallas dispatch from the chain in  united press caused a storm of controversy when it reported the end of world war i four days before it actually ended ew scripps’s health started declining during the war and by its end he was largely living on his yacht in  he gave direct control of the chain to his son robert and roy w howard and in  incorporated all of his stock news services and newspapers into the ew scripps company based in cincinnati the profits went to the scripps trust set up for his heirs despite his semiretirement scripps had the energy to direct a last burst of expansion in the s he made roy howard chairman and business director in  howard had played an important role in building the united press by  he was placed in full charge of both business and editorial by ew’s son robert the newspaper chain was renamed the scripps howard league beginning in  newspapers were bought or started in birmingham alabama indianapolis indiana baltimore maryland and pittsburgh sales for  came to about  million in  the denverbased rocky mountain news and times were bought at the time of ew scripps’s death in  the scripps howard league was the second largest newspaper chain in the united states after william randolph hearst’s ew scripps was one the most successful newspaper owners of the era of the socalled press barons because of his reclusive personality though he was one of the least known he stood up for the working class but in many ways despised them in addition he encouraged his newspapers to crusade for female suffrage but considered women inferior to men in all scripps started  newspapers some of them did not stay in business long some were unsophisticated but remained fiercely independent their emphasis on human interest stories was welcomed by new immigrants who had lost their former communities company perspectives scripps aims at excellence in the products and services we produce and responsible service to the communities in which we operate our purpose is to continue to engage in successful growing enterprises in the fields of information and entertainment the company intends to expand to develop and acquire new products and services and to pursue new market opportunities our focus shall be longterm growth for the benefit of shareholders and employees roy howard’s stock holding in the company was small but with his strong personality he influenced the scripps heirs and took working control of the company managing it as if it were his own and bringing his own family into the company hierarchy in  scripps howard bought the new york telegram four years later it purchased the new york world and merged the two newspapers into the worldtelegram in  howard gave up his position as chairman of the chain and became president in the s united press built a network of bureaus in south and central america and in the far east though its coverage was weaker in europe and it remained smaller than ap also that decade the newspaper chain began to shrink as lessprofitable papers were sold or consolidated and sixday evening papers began to lose their appeal during world war ii ernie pyle came to fame as a scripps howard columnist reporting from the european battle theater before losing his life on a pacific battlefield postwar growth after world war ii scripps howard’s sales grew dramatically from nearly  million in  to more than  million in  and  million in  profits however were not increasing due to the rising cost of labor newsprint and printing machinery profits were hovering around  million according to forbes magazine in  ew scripps’s grandson charles e scripps became company chairman at the age of  and roy howard’s son jack r became company president at the age of  by this time scripps howard had  newspapers with a total circulation of four million the company was also expanding into broadcasting and owned radio and television stations in cleveland and cincinnati as well as in knoxville and memphis tennessee the scripps family trust still owned nearly  percent of the company management was decentralized with general operations conducted in new york editorial policy in washington and finances in cincinnati in  united press merged with the hearst corporation’s troubled international news service to become united press international upi hearst gained five percent ownership of upi but most former international news service employees were laid off also that year scripps bought the cincinnati timesstar and merged it into the post giving the company control of all of cincinnati’s daily newspapers the cincinnati enquirer —which had been acquired in —was carefully kept separate from the other papers to diminish possible charges of a monopoly in  however the us department of justice accused scripps howard of owning a monopoly and ordered it to sell the enquirer the enquirer was far stronger financially but the trust’s lawyers advised the firm that it would be better off selling it rather than trying to sell the post in the meantime scripps continued building its broadcast division buying wptv in west palm beach florida for  million in  in  the broadcast properties were taken public under the name scripps howard broadcasting company the initial offering quickly sold out leaving the ew scripps company with twothirds ownership roy howard died in  one of the problems jack howard—who had succeed roy howard as president in —faced was that the company was still run for the beneficiaries of the ew scripps trust and the trustees’s lawyers sometimes had a large role in significant corporate decisions more importantly with the rise of television after world war ii evening newspapers across the united states found their circulations declining people read the newspaper in the morning and watched the news on television in the evening in addition management of scripps had become so conservative that critics charged it had no longrange plans and did little beyond preserve its assets more and more scripps newspapers took advantage of a law that allowed newspapers in danger of failing to partially merge with stronger rivals keeping only editorial departments separate by   of the  remaining scripps dailies were in such arrangements a higher percentage than any other major chain in  jack howard retired as president of ew scripps but remained a director of ew scripps and chairman of scripps howard broadcasting edward estlow became ew scripps’s first ceo who was not from the scripps or howard families he had been the chain’s general business manager scripps slowly began to change in the s in  the company bought for  million the  percent of media investment co that it did not already own media investment had holdings in some of scripps’s newspapers and radio and television stations the purpose of acquiring the investment company was to permit employees to own shares in the diversified ew scripps company sold cleveland press and upi in the early s upi losses were continuing to increase— million between  and  in addition some of scripps’s newspapers were operating in the red including the flagship cleveland press in  scripps sold the press for an undisclosed amount to cleveland retailer joseph e cole the chain then had  daily newspapers making it the seventh largest in the united states scripps continued a policy of not reporting financial data but the wall street journal cited its sales at approximately  million in  the ew scripps company began looking for a buyer for upi estlow said that part of the reason was the possibility that the beneficiaries of the scripps trust fund might bring legal action forcing the closing or selling of the wire service in  the firm found a buyer for upi media news corporation a private firm started for the purpose of buying upi which had  bureaus and  employees the purchase price was not disclosed but industry analysts felt it could not have been much more than the value of upfs assets which the new york times estimated were worth about  million in the early s scripps began funneling money into its chain of weekly business journals the publications were losing readership and advertising revenue and some criticized them as lacking hard news in  lawrence a leser became president of scripps and quickly began making changes he sold many of the weeklies as well as a videotape publishing business and concentrated on building the cable broadcast and daily newspaper operations particularly in the rapidly growing south and west in  the company bought two television stations from capital cities communications and the american broadcasting co scripps paid an estimated  million for wxyz in detroit and wfts in tampa the company was also building a string of cable television systems in  scripps merged with the john p scripps newspaper chain which was comprised of six california newspapers and one washington newspaper going public in  these purchases along with a cable system being built in sacramento left the company with millions of dollars in debt partly in an effort to pay off this debt the

reporting operating income of  million on sales of  billion it owned  daily newspapers and nine television stations and cable systems in ten states the  stock offering left the scripps trust with approximately  percent ownership of the company in december  the ew scripps company formed scripps howard productions to produce and market television programs in february  it sold the sixday florida

regional sports programming on cable television in six southern states most of the firm’s revenue continued to come from newspapers but it believed that future growth would come from cable television as of the early s the firm had  cable subscribers making it one of the  largest cable system operators in the united states the ew scripps company also negotiated to buy wmartv in baltimore from gillett holdings for  million scripps backed out of the deal at the last minute and was sued by gillett the firms settled out of court and scripps bought the station for  million in cash in late  the

sold its four radio stations its television station in memphis tennessee and newspapers in tulare california and san juan puerto rico these moves occurred at the same time that the company was

newspaper the cleveland penny press scripps had  in capital and owned  percent of the paper the rest was owned by his halfbrothers george henry and james edmund scripps—each of whom received  percent stakes in the company—and other partners e w scripps was a populist who thought that most newspapers were geared towards the rich he wanted his newspaper to keep the poor informed through short simple stories that could be understood by those without extensive education he got many of these ideas from james scripps an english immigrant who started the detroit evening news in  e w also added his interest in personal stories to the mix later giving a raise to an editor who published the fact that he had been fined  for riding a horse while intoxicated at the time the cleveland penny press was founded most newspapers had a party affiliation they also sold for more than a penny and many contemporaries were skeptical that the press would succeed e w scripps’s formula proved successful however and within weeks the cleveland penny press had a circulation of approximately  it was not a profitable operation however until james scripps ordered e w to run the paper for  a week as soon as the penny press was making money e w persuaded his brothers to buy the st louis chronicle he then spent a year in st louis managing the paper e w bought a  percent in the penny post —part of which was already owned by james—went to cincinnati to manage it and changed the paper’s name to the cincinnati post he subsequently began taking on political corruption and winning circulation from  to  james scripps was in europe receiving medical treatment while e w managed the detroit news although e w expanded advertising and circulation james was angry with the changes his brother made upon his return james removed e w from every position he could in  e w started his own paper the kentucky post in covington across the ohio river from cincinnati also in  e w scripps entered into a partnership with his business manager milton mcrae the two called their newspaper company the scrippsmcrae league mcrae handled daytoday management of the papers and received onethird of the profits while scripps set editorial guidelines and longterm policy in  with his business running smoothly scripps began building a ranch outside of san diego california in  george scripps joined scrippsmcrae this gave the group a controlling interest in the cleveland press later in the s the group started the akron press and kansas city world as his chain expanded e w scripps chose young growing towns to start new newspapers he invested as little in machinery or plants as possible usually buying old presses and renting rundown buildings he would then hire young ambitious editors who were given a minority stake in their paper many of them became rich if their newspapers succeeded with e w scripps spending most of his time in california mcrae often exceeded his authority and put editorial pressure on newspaper editors scripps would periodically venture out of california discover what mcrae was doing and reverse it scripps next began a series of west coast newspapers unassociated with the scrippsmcrae league group they included papers in los angeles san francisco fresno berkeley and oakland california as well as seattle tacoma and spokane washington in  george scripps died leaving his

specialized subjects as sports and fashion newspapers in the scripps chain paid a monthly fee and received information and illustrations none of them could have afforded individually though the nea was originally only for scripps papers demand for its services was so great that it soon became available to any newspaper in  scripps entered another period of expansion buying or starting papers in denver and pueblo colorado evansville and terre haute indiana memphis and nashville tennessee dallas texas and oklahoma in  scripps combined the nea the scripps mcrae press association and publishers press into the united press association wire service in order to provide  words of copy a day by telegraph to  subscribers in the united states a similar service the associated press ap already existed and was far larger and better financed scripps viewed ap as monopolistic and too close to the establishment and deliberately set out to oppose it ap was also geared toward morning newspapers while most of scripps’s were evening newspapers scripps therefore had each of his papers send out stories from their area during the day and combined them with information gathered at offices set up in important newsproducing cities like washington dc and other world capitals in  scripps retired from active management appointing his son james g scripps chairman of the board during world war i scripps was a passionate advocate of united states intervention on the side of the allies and moved to washington dc to push his cause shortly thereafter a family crisis erupted during which scripps’s son james detached the five west coast newspapers and the dallas dispatch from the chain in  united press caused a storm of controversy when it reported the end of world war i four days before it actually ended scripps’s health started declining during the war and by its end he was largely living on his yacht in  he gave direct control of the chain to his son robert and roy w howard and in  incorporated all of his stock news services and newspapers into the ew scripps company based in cincinnati the profits went to the scripps trust set up for his heirs despite his semiretirement scripps had the energy to direct a last burst of expansion in the s he made roy howard chairman and business director in  howard had played an important role in building the united press by  he was placed in full charge of both business and editorial by e w’s son robert the newspaper chain was renamed the scripps howard league beginning in  newspapers were bought or started in birmingham alabama indianapolis indiana baltimore maryland and pittsburgh sales for  came to about  million in  the denverbased rocky mountain news and times were bought at the time of e w scripps’s death in  the scripps howard league was the secondlargest newspaper chain in the united states after william randolph hearst’s e w scripps was one the most successful newspaper owners of the era of the socalled press barons because of his reclusive personality though he was one of the least known he stood up for the working class but in many ways despised them and he encouraged his newspapers to crusade for female suffrage but considered women inferior to men all in all scripps started  newspapers some of them did not stay in business long some were unsophisticated but remained fiercely independent their emphasis on human interest stories was welcomed by new immigrants who had lost their former communities roy howard’s stock holding in the company was small but with his strong personality he influenced the scripps heirs and took working control of the company managing it as if it were his own and bringing his own family into the company hierarchy in  scripps howard bought the new york telegram four years later it purchased the new york world and merged the two newspapers into the worldtelegram in  howard gave up his position as chairman of the chain and became president in the s united press built a network of bureaus in south and central america and in the far east though its coverage was weaker in europe and it remained smaller than ap also that decade the newspaper chain began to shrink as lessprofitable papers were sold or consolidated and sixday evening papers began to lose their appeal after world war ii scripps howard’s sales grew dramatically from nearly  million in  to more than  million in  and  million in  profits however were not increasing due to the rising cost of labor newsprint and printing machinery profits were hovering around  million according to forbes magazine in  e w scripps’s grandson charles e scripps became company chairman at the age of  and roy howard’s son jack r became company president at the age of  by this time scripps howard had  newspapers with a total circulation of  million the company was also expanding into broadcasting and owned radio and television stations in cleveland and cincinnati as well as in knoxville and memphis tennessee the scripps family trust still owned nearly  percent of the company management was decentralized with general operations in new york editorial policy centered in washington and finances handled in cincinnati in  united press merged with the hearst corporation’s troubled international news service to become united press international upi hearst gained five percent ownership of upi but most former international news service employees were laid off also that year scripps bought the cincinnati timesstar and merged it into the post giving the company control of all of cincinnati’s daily newspapers the cincinnati enquirer —which had been acquired in —was carefully kept separate from the other papers to diminish possible charges of a monopoly in  however the us department of justice accused scripps howard of owning a monopoly and ordered it to sell the enquirer the enquirer was far stronger financially but the trust’s lawyers advised the firm that it would be better off selling it rather than trying to sell the post in the meantime scripps continued building its broadcast division buying wptv in west palm beach florida for  million in  in  the broadcast properties were taken public under the name scripps howard broadcasting company the initial offering quickly sold out leaving the ew scripps company with twothirds ownership roy howard died in  one of the problems jack howard—who had succeed roy howard as president in —faced was that the company was still run for the beneficiaries of the ew scripps trust and the trustees’ lawyers sometimes had a large role in significant corporate decisions more importantly with the rise of television after world war ii evening newspapers across the united states found their circulations declining people read the newspaper in the morning and watched the news on tv in the evening in addition management of scripps had become so conservative that critics charged it had no longrange plans and did little beyond preserve its assets more and more scripps newspapers took advantage of a law that allowed newspapers in danger of failing to partially merge with stronger rivals keeping only editorial departments separate by  eight of the  remaining scripps dailies were in such arrangements a higher percentage than any other major chain in  jack howard retired as president of ew scripps but remained a director of ew scripps and chairman of scripps howard broadcasting edward estlow became ew scripps’s first chief executive officer who was not from the scripps or howard families he had been the chain’s general business manager scripps slowly began to change in the s in  the company bought for  million the  percent of media investment co that it did not already own media investment had holdings in some of scripps’s newspapers and radio and tv stations the purpose of acquiring the investment company was to permit employees to own shares in the diversified ew scripps company upi losses were continuing to increase— million between  and  in addition some of scripps’s newspapers were operating in the red including the flagship cleveland press in  scripps sold the press for an undisclosed amount to cleveland retailer joseph e cole the chain then had  daily newspapers making it the seventhlargest in the united states scripps continued a policy of not reporting financial data but the wall street journal cited its sales at approximately  million in  the ew scripps company began looking for a buyer for upi estlow said that part of the reason was the possibility that the beneficiaries of the scripps trust fund might bring legal action forcing the closing or selling of the wire service in  the firm found a buyer for upi media news corporation a private firm started for the purpose of buying upi which had  bureaus and  employees the purchase price was not disclosed but industry analysts felt it could not have been much more than the value of upi’s assets which the new york times estimated were worth about  million in the early s scripps began funneling money into its chain of weekly business journals the publications were losing readership and advertising revenue and some criticized them as lacking hard news in  lawrence a leser became president of scripps and quickly began making changes he sold many of the weeklies as well as a videotapepublishing business and concentrated on building the cable broadcast and daily newspaper operations particularly in the rapidly growing south and west in  the company bought two television stations from capital cities communications and the american broadcasting co scripps paid an estimated  million for wxyz in detroit and wfts in tampa the company was also building a string of cable tv systems and in  scripps merged with the john p scripps newspaper chain which was comprised of six california newspapers and one washington newspaper these purchases along with a cable system being built in sacramento left the company with millions of dollars in debt partly in an effort to pay off this debt the scripps family members who controlled the scripps trust fund decided to take the company public in  as a prelude to its stock offering the firm officially released financial data for the first time reporting an operating income of  million on sales of  billion it owned  daily newspapers and  tv stations and cable systems in  states the  stock offering left the scripps trust with approximately  percent ownership of the company in december of  the ew scripps company formed scripps howard productions to produce and market tv programs in february of  it sold the sixday florida suntattler for an undisclosed amount and bought cable usa’s system in carroll county georgia profits for  were  million on sales of  billion in  scripps began the sportsouth network to provide regional sports programming on cabletv in six southern states most of the firm’s revenue continued to come from newspapers but it believed that future growth would come from cabletv as of the early s the firm had  cable subscribers making it one of the  largest cable system operators in the united states the ew scripps company also negotiated to buy wmartv in baltimore from gillett holdings for  million scripps backed out of the deal at the last minute and was sued by gillett the firms settled out of court and scripps bought the station for  million in cash in late  the company announced a modernization of the pittsburgh press delivery systems the modernization which would cause hundreds of layoffs resulted in a crippling strike that lasted well into  the newspaper was sold on december   in february of  the ew scripps company sold its pharos books and world almanac education to kiii communications in march of
