language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs especially in approaches to government often the deciding body for the formation of a jv or dispute settlement the ideal process of

following major ways foreign investor buying an interest in a local company local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new

appropriate authority the memorandum of association it is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence it may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed a sample can be seen at wikimediaorg together with the articles of association it forms the constitution of a company in these countries the articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to  pages it deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions special resolutions and the holding of extraordinary general meetings to bring the directors decision to bear a certificate of incorporation or the articles of incorporation is a document required to form a corporation in the us in actuality the state where it is incorporated and in countries following the practice in the us the constitution is a single document the articles of incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stockholders in a company by its formation the jv becomes a new entity with the implication that it is officially separate from its founders who might otherwise be giant corporations even amongst the emerging countries the jv can contract in its own name acquire rights such as the right to buy new companies and it has a separate liability from that of its founders except for invested capital it can sue and be sued in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives on the receipt of the certificate of incorporation a company can commence its business shareholders agreementedit this is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ particularly on the enforceability of heads of or shareholder agreements for some legal reasons it may be called a memorandum of understanding it is done in parallel with other activities in forming a jv though dealt with briefly for a shareholders agreement some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows there are also many issues which are not in the articles when a company starts up or never ever present also a jv may elect to stay as a jv alone in a quasi partnership to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public some of the issues in a shareholders agreement are valuation of intellectual rights say the valuations of the ipr of one partner andsay the real estate of the other the control of the company either by the number of directors or its funding the number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality management decisions  whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares  assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy  percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up  the conditions notice to members confidentiality of knowhow and founders agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal  purchase rights and counterbid by a founder there are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off normally it requires no submission to any authority the other basic document which must be articulated is the articles which is a published document and known to members this repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors whether the board controls or the founders the taking of decisions by simple majority  of those present or a  or  majority with all directors present their alternatesproxy the deployment of funds of the firm extent of debt the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends etc also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved if one of the partners dies or if the firm is sold often the most successful jvs are those with  partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm or rights to appoint the chairperson and vicechair of the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures ejvs sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cjvs wholly foreignowned enterprises wfoe although they do not strictly belong to joint ventures plus foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs and investment companies through foreign investors icfi each category is described below equity joint venturesedit the ejv law is between a chinese partner and a foreign company it is incorporated in both chinese official and in english with equal validity with limited liability prior to chinas entry into wto – and thus the wfoes – ejvs predominated in the ejv mode the partners share profits losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the ventures registered capital these escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital the jv contract accompanied by the articles of association for the ejv are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project the articles mirror many of the provisions of the jv contract in case of conflict the jv document has precedence these documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report there are also the ancillary documents termed offsets in the us covering knowhow and trademarks and supplyofequipment agreements the minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated where the foreign equity and debt levels are less than us million equity must constitute  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment more than us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment there are also intermediary levels the foreign investment in the total project must be at least  no minimum investment is set for the chinese partner the timing of investments must be mentioned in the agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time draws a penalty cooperative joint venturesedit cooperative joint ventures cjvs are permitted under the sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cooperative enterprises are also called contractual operative enterprises the cjvs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore there are two versions the limitedliability version is similar to the ejvs in status of permissions  the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the chinese party provides land buildings equipment etc however there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder the other format of the cjv is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created in both the cases the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal chinese person which can hire labor directly as for example a chinese national contactor the minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment other differences from the ejv are to be noted a cooperative jv does not have to be a legal entity the partners in a cjv are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution this proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion it may be possible to operate in a cjv in a restricted area a cjv could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts in an ejv management control is through allocation of board seats during the term of the venture the foreign participant can recover his investment provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the chinese participant on termination of the jv foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management voting and staffing rights into a cjvs articles since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment it is therefore easier to find cooperative partners and to reach an agreement with changes in the law it becomes possible to merge with a chinese company for a quick start a foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in china instead the investor uses the chinese partners business license under a contractual arrangement under the cjv however the land stays in the possession of the chinese partner there is another advantage the percentage of the cjv owned by each partner can change throughout the jvs life giving the option to the foreign investor by holding higher equity obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining longterm control the parties in any of the ventures ejv cjv or wfoe prepare a feasibility study outlined above it is a nonbinding document  the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project the feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation the study should contain details referred to earlier under feasibility study submissions by the chinese partner wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoesedit main article wholly foreignowned enterprise there is basic law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls wfoes chinas entry into the world trade organization wto around  has had profound effects on foreign investment not being a jv they are considered here only in comparison or contrast to implement wto commitments china publishes from time to time updated versions of its catalogs investments affecting ventures prohibited restricted the wfoe is a chinese legal person and has to obey all chinese laws as such it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights rent buildings and receive utility services in this it is more similar to a cjv than an ejv wfoes are expected by prc to use the most modern technologies and to export at least  of their production with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control wfoes are typically limited liability enterprises like with ejvs but the liability of the directors managers advisers and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the departments or ministries which control product liability worker safety or environmental protection an advantage the wfoe enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its knowhow but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential chinese party parts of this article those related to distribution analysis of jv in industry need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information

template message a joint venture jv is a business entity created by two or more parties generally characterized by shared ownership shared returns and risks and shared governance most joint ventures are incorporated although some as in the oil and gas industry are unincorporated joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity key elements of a joint ventures design include  the number of parties  the geographic product technology and valuechain scope within which the jv will operate  the contributions of the parties  the structural form each country has specific options eg in the us the main options are a c corporation or an llcpartnership structure  the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties  the economic arrangements postdeal eg is the joint venture intended to general profits vs operate as a costsharing or productionsharing venture if a forprofit entity will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership or some other way  governance and control  talenthr model will the jv have its own staff on own payroll vs second staff from the parent companies  contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs outputs or services  exit and evolution provisions companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons to access a new market particularly emerging markets to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations to share risk for major investments or projects or to access skills and capabilities in european law the term joint venture or joint undertaking is an elusive legal concept better defined under the rules of company law in france the term joint venture is variously translated association dentreprises entreprise conjointe coentreprise or entreprise commune in germany joint venture is better represented as a combination of companies konzern with individuals when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are coventurers the venture can be a business jv for example dow corning a projectasset jv intended to pursue one specific project only or a jv aimed at defining standards or serving as an industry utility that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants some major joint ventures include millercoors sony ericsson penske truck leasing and owenscorning  and in the past dow corning contents  jv process  partner selection  company incorporation  shareholders agreement  chinese law  equity joint ventures  cooperative joint ventures  wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoes  foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs  investment companies by foreign investors icfi  joint ventures in india  joint ventures in ukraine  dissolution  see also  references  external links jv processedit overall the jv process has a series of steps defining the business strategy determining whether a jv is the right vehicle this requires comparing the jv option against acquisition nonequity partnership contractual alliance or goalone approaches generally jvs are most appropriate when  they are focused on combining complementary capabilities eg products and market access sharing risks or  merging businesses where an outright ma transaction isnt possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition cant be recovered via operating synergies and  when goitalone is too risky or too slow and  simpler vehicles like contractual agreements arent sufficient screening partners developing the jv deal concept negotiating detailed terms and conditions planning and launching the jv evolving or terminating the jv partner selectionedit while the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a jv it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary this is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs especially in approaches to government often the deciding body for the formation of a jv or dispute settlement the ideal process of selecting a jv partner emerges from screening of prospective partners short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture the most appropriate structure and invitationbid foreign investor buying an interest in a local company companies are also called jvs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public there may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity these companies may be public or private companies it would be out of place to describe them except to say there are many in india further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up such an enterprise is sometimes called an incorporated jv one packaged with technology contracts knowhow patents trademarks and copyright technical services and assistedsupply arrangements the consortium jv also known as a cooperative agreement is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements franchise and brand use agreements management contracts rental agreements for onetime contracts eg for construction projects they dissolve the jv when that goal is reached company incorporationedit a jv can be brought about in the following major ways foreign investor buying an interest in a local company local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise together with public capital andor bank debt in the uk india and in many common law countries a jointventure or else a company formed by a group of individuals must file with the appropriate authority the memorandum of association it is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence it may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed a sample can be seen at wikimediaorg together with the articles of association it forms the constitution of a company in these countries the articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to  pages it deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions special resolutions and the holding of extraordinary general meetings to bring the directors decision to bear a certificate of incorporation or the articles of incorporation is a document required to form a corporation in the us in actuality the state where it is incorporated and in countries following the practice in the us the constitution is a single document the articles of incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stockholders in a company by its formation the jv becomes a new entity with the implication that it is officially separate from its founders who might otherwise be giant corporations even amongst the emerging countries the jv can contract in its own name acquire rights such as the right to buy new companies and it has a separate liability from that of its founders except for invested capital it can sue and be sued in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives on the receipt of the certificate of incorporation a company can commence its business shareholders agreementedit this is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ particularly on the enforceability of heads of or shareholder agreements for some legal reasons it may be called a memorandum of understanding it is done in parallel with other activities in forming a jv though dealt with briefly for a shareholders agreement some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows there are also many issues which are not in the articles when a company starts up or never ever present also a jv may elect to stay as a jv alone in a quasi partnership to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public some of the issues in a shareholders agreement are valuation of intellectual rights say the valuations of the ipr of one partner andsay the real estate of the other the control of the company either by the number of directors or its funding the number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality management decisions  whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares  assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy  percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up  the conditions notice to members confidentiality of knowhow and founders agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal  purchase rights and counterbid by a founder there are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off normally it requires no submission to any authority the other basic document which must be articulated is the articles which is a published document and known to members this repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors whether the board controls or the founders the taking of decisions by simple majority  of those present or a  or  majority with all directors present their alternatesproxy the deployment of funds of the firm extent of debt the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends etc also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved if one of the partners dies or if the firm is sold often the most successful jvs are those with  partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm or rights to appoint the chairperson and vicechair of the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures

appropriate authority the memorandum of association it is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence it may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed a sample can be seen at wikimediaorg together with the articles of association it forms the constitution of a company in these countries the articles of association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to  pages it deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions special resolutions and the holding of extraordinary general meetings to bring the directors decision to bear a certificate of incorporation or the articles of incorporation is a document required to form a corporation in the us in actuality the state where it is incorporated and in countries following the practice in the us the constitution is a single document the articles of incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stockholders in a company by its formation the jv becomes a new entity with the implication that it is officially separate from its founders who might otherwise be giant corporations even amongst the emerging countries the jv can contract in its own name acquire rights such as the right to buy new companies and it has a separate liability from that of its founders except for invested capital it can sue and be sued in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives on the receipt of the certificate of

heads of or shareholder agreements for some legal reasons it may be called a memorandum of understanding it is done in parallel with other activities in forming a jv though dealt with briefly for a shareholders agreement some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows there are also many issues which are not in the articles when a company starts up or never ever present also a jv may elect to stay as a jv alone in a quasi partnership to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public some of the issues in a shareholders agreement are valuation of intellectual rights say the valuations of the ipr of one partner andsay the real estate of the other the control of the company either by the number of directors or its funding the number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality management decisions  whether the board manages or a founder transferability of shares  assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company dividend policy  percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit winding up  the conditions notice to members confidentiality of knowhow and founders agreement and penalties for disclosure first right of refusal  purchase rights and counterbid by a founder there are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off normally it requires no submission to any authority the other basic document which must be articulated is the articles which is a published document and known to members this repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors whether the board controls or the founders the taking of decisions by simple majority  of those present or a  or  majority with all directors present their alternatesproxy the deployment of funds of the firm extent of debt the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends etc also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved if one of the partners dies or if the firm is sold often the most successful jvs are those with  partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm or rights to appoint the chairperson and vicechair of the company sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the founder at board meetings recently in a major case the indian supreme court has held that memorandums of understanding whose details are not in the articles of association are unconstitutional giving more transparency to undertakings chinese lawedit according to a report of the united nations conference on trade and development  china was the recipient of us billion in direct foreign investment making it the worlds largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time to exceed the usa also it approved the establishment of nearly  foreigninvestment enterprises the us had  projects by  with an inplace investment of over  billion until recently no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of china toward foreign investors following the death of mao zedong in  initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in  while the first sinoforeign equity venture took place in  the corpus of the law has improved since then companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures ejvs sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cjvs wholly foreignowned enterprises wfoe although they do not strictly belong to joint ventures plus foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs and investment companies through foreign investors icfi each category is described below equity joint venturesedit the ejv law is between a chinese partner and a foreign company it is incorporated in both chinese official and in english with equal validity with limited liability prior to chinas entry into wto – and thus the wfoes – ejvs predominated in the ejv mode the partners share profits losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the ventures registered capital these escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital the jv contract accompanied by the articles of association for the ejv are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project the articles mirror many of the provisions of the jv contract in case of conflict the jv document has precedence these documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report there are also the ancillary documents termed offsets in the us covering knowhow and trademarks and supplyofequipment agreements the minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated where the foreign equity and debt levels are less than us million equity must constitute  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment more than us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment there are also intermediary levels the foreign investment in the total project must be at least  no minimum investment is set for the chinese partner the timing of investments must be mentioned in the agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time draws a penalty cooperative joint venturesedit cooperative joint ventures cjvs are permitted under the sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cooperative enterprises are also called contractual operative enterprises the cjvs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore there are two versions the limitedliability version is similar to the ejvs in status of permissions  the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the chinese party provides land buildings equipment etc however there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder the other format of the cjv is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created in both the cases the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal chinese person which can hire labor directly as for example a chinese national contactor the minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment other differences from the ejv are to be noted a cooperative jv does not have to be a legal entity the partners in a cjv are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution this proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion it may be possible to operate in a cjv in a restricted area a cjv could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts in an ejv management control is through allocation of board seats during the term of the venture the foreign participant can recover his investment provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the chinese participant on termination of the jv foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management voting and staffing rights into a cjvs articles since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment it is therefore easier to find cooperative partners and to reach an agreement with changes in the law it becomes possible to merge with a chinese company for a quick start a foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in china instead the investor uses the chinese partners business license under a contractual arrangement under the cjv however the land stays in the possession of the chinese partner there is another advantage the percentage of the cjv owned by each partner can change throughout the jvs life giving the option to the foreign investor by holding higher equity obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining longterm control the parties in any of the ventures ejv cjv or wfoe prepare a feasibility study outlined above it is a nonbinding document  the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project the feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation the study should contain details referred to earlier under feasibility study submissions by the chinese partner wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoesedit main article wholly foreignowned enterprise there is basic law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls wfoes chinas entry into the world trade organization wto around  has had profound effects on foreign investment not being a jv they are considered here only in comparison or contrast to implement wto commitments china publishes from time to time updated versions of its catalogs investments affecting ventures prohibited restricted the wfoe is a chinese legal person and has to obey all chinese laws as such it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights rent buildings and receive utility services in this it is more similar to a cjv than an ejv wfoes are expected by prc to use the most modern technologies and to export at least  of their production with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control wfoes are typically limited liability enterprises like with ejvs but the liability of the directors managers advisers and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the departments or ministries which control product liability worker safety or environmental protection an advantage the wfoe enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its knowhow but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential chinese party parts of this article those related to distribution analysis of jv in industry need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information

can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in china and can sell through their own sales network foreignsino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly chinese companies as china desires to import foreign technology by encouraging jvs and the latest technologies under chinese law foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories of these five will be described or mentioned here three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment those  categories of chinese foreign enterprises are the sinoforeign equity joint ventures ejvs sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cjvs wholly foreignowned enterprises wfoe although they do not strictly belong to joint ventures plus foreign investment companies limited by shares ficlbs and investment companies through foreign investors icfi each category is described below equity joint venturesedit the ejv law is between a chinese partner and a foreign company it is incorporated in both chinese official and in english with equal validity with limited liability prior to chinas entry into wto – and thus the wfoes – ejvs predominated in the ejv mode the partners share profits losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the ventures registered capital these escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital the jv contract accompanied by the articles of association for the ejv are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project the articles mirror many of the provisions of the jv contract in case of conflict the jv document has precedence these documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report there are also the ancillary documents termed offsets in the us covering knowhow and trademarks and supplyofequipment agreements the minimum equity is prescribed for investment truncated where the foreign equity and debt levels are less than us million equity must constitute  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment between us million and us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment more than us million minimum equity must be us million and at least  of the investment there are also intermediary levels the foreign investment in the total project must be at least  no minimum investment is set for the chinese partner the timing of investments must be mentioned in the agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time draws a penalty cooperative joint venturesedit cooperative joint ventures cjvs are permitted under the sinoforeign cooperative joint ventures cooperative enterprises are also called contractual operative enterprises the cjvs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore there are two versions the limitedliability version is similar to the ejvs in status of permissions  the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the chinese party provides land buildings equipment etc however there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder the other format of the cjv is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created in both the cases the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal chinese person which can hire labor directly as for example a chinese national contactor the minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment other differences from the ejv are to be noted a cooperative jv does not have to be a legal entity the partners in a cjv are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution this proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion it may be possible to operate in a cjv in a restricted area a cjv could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts in an ejv management control is through allocation of board seats during the term of the venture the foreign participant can recover his investment provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the chinese participant on termination of the jv foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management voting and staffing rights into a cjvs articles since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment it is therefore easier to find cooperative partners and to reach an agreement with changes in the law it becomes possible to merge with a chinese company for a quick start a foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in china instead the investor uses the chinese partners business license under a contractual arrangement under the cjv however the land stays in the possession of the chinese partner there is another advantage the percentage of the cjv owned by each partner can change throughout the jvs life giving the option to the foreign investor by holding higher equity obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining longterm control the parties in any of the ventures ejv cjv or wfoe prepare a feasibility study outlined above it is a nonbinding document  the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project the feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation the study should contain details referred to earlier under feasibility study submissions by the chinese partner wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoesedit main article wholly foreignowned enterprise there is basic law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls wfoes chinas entry into the world trade organization wto around  has had profound effects on foreign investment not being a jv they are considered here only in comparison or contrast to implement wto commitments china publishes from time to time updated versions of its catalogs investments affecting ventures prohibited restricted the wfoe is a chinese legal person and has to obey all chinese laws as such it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights rent buildings and receive utility services in this it is more similar to a cjv than an ejv wfoes are expected by prc to use the most modern technologies and to export at least  of their production with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control wfoes are typically limited liability enterprises like with ejvs but the liability of the directors managers advisers and suppliers depends on the rules which govern the departments or ministries which control product liability worker safety or environmental protection an advantage the wfoe enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its knowhow but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential chinese party parts of this article those related to distribution analysis of jv in industry need to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information

boxed beef and sheepmeat to inner mongolia under the new agreement with the inner mongolian government and the heilongjiang grand farm group grand farm is said to be seeking delivery of up to  sea containers of lamb and beef a day a figure which sounds fanciful but if true would be well beyond the capacity of vv walsh or any individual australian exporter to deliver vv walsh principal peter walsh image bunbury mail “they will take whatever we can give them” peter walsh told the australian newspaper yesterday the walsh brothers visited china about  years ago to sell sheepskins and realised it was a future important market for the family’s meat business on sunday western australia’s agriculture minister ken baston said the threeway deal would significantly increase wa’s meat and fodder exports to china and inject hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy “with an estimated investment of  billion over five years the project will involve v  v walsh as well as china’s largest red meat importer from australia and nz grand farm and the inner mongolian government” mr baston said there will be investments in both jurisdictions — m of chinese investment into wa to increase lamb and beef production through the bunbury plant and potentially other points along the supply chain and m in inner mongolia where there are plans to develop new processing facilities and an expansive network of feeding systems mr baston told the australian that he believed there was strong potential for growth of beef and sheep meat into china because each citizen consumes an average kg of beef a year and kg of sheepmeat australians consume an average kg of beef and kg of sheepmeat “for every kilogram of extra lamb consumed in china an extra  million lambs would be required fr every kilogram of extra beef consumed in china an extra  million cattle would be required wa has the very significant opportunity to grow exports” mr baston said v  v walsh based at bunbury is in the final stages of gaining regulatory approval to export meat to china and chinese officials will soon tour the facilities to ensure they are satisfied the australian said peter walsh said the joint venture grew out of a year friendship between his family and grand farm president and china’s beef and lamb association chairman chen xibin sheepmeat exports from wa to china rose  percent by weight from  to  reaching  million in value it’s not the first time china’s grand farm has entered into joint ventures for red meat supply in australasia last year the company struck a
