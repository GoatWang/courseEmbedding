connected differ by brand many innerspring mattresses have pillow tops on one side or both although less expensive ones dontgel mattresses gel mattresses feature a foam material that contains gel to form the mattresss support and that material provides varying levels of comfort and heat dissipationlatex foam mattresses latex mattresses feature foam that comes from petroleumbased or plantbased materials and they feature foam as part of the support system and in the outer layersmemory foam mattresses also known as visco elastic foam these mattresses include highdensity polyurethane foam

thickness of the pillow top varies by mattress and can be made from fiber or foam materialsair mattresses although some air mattresses are only filled with a single pocket of air some have multiple chambers to allow for more flexibility and are usually covered in a cloth or foam material that has padding underneathbox springs are available for all sizes of mattresses and work best on mattresses

cold nights waterbeds have vinyl coverings that must be used specifically with waterbed frames some come with doublewalled surfaces and reinforced corners for more leak protectionmattress pads and toppersfor those who have a mattress without exterior padding or want additional padding to sleep mattress pads and toppers are the answer mattress pads use many of the same materials as the mattresses themselves including memory form and gelfilled foam some have fillings that are more like pillows and have down or down alternative as the padding the thickness of mattress pads varies from  inch to  inches or more mattress toppers are similar to mattress pads but these sometimes go onto the fitted sheet covering the mattress rather than encasing it these offer temperature control
