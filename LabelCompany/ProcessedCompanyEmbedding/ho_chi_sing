thanh a clerk in the french army his brother nguyễn sinh khiêm or nguyễn tất đạt a geomancer and traditional herbalist and another brother nguyễn sinh nhuận who died in his infancy as a young child cung studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named vuong thuc do cung quickly mastered chinese writing a prerequisite for any serious study of confucianism while honing his colloquial vietnamese writing in addition to his studious endeavors he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing following confucian tradition at the age of  his father gave him a new name nguyễn tất thành nguyễn the accomplished thànhs father was a confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of binh khe qui nhơn he was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received  strokes of the cane as punishment for an infractionthànhs father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy but refused because it meant serving the french this exposed thành to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province where thành came of age the province was known for its resistance to foreign rule in deference to his father thành received a french education attended lycée in huế the alma mater of his later disciples phạm văn đồng and võ nguyên giáp and his later enemy ngô đình diệm first sojourn in franceedit previously it was believed that thành was involved in an antislavery anticorvée demonstration of poor peasants in huế in may  which endangered his student status at collège quốc học however a document from the centre des archives doutremer in france shows that he was admitted to collège quốc học on  august  which was several months after the anticorvée demonstration – april  the exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among vietnamese communist leaders as shown in tôn đức thắngs falsified participation in the  black sea revolt later in life hồ would claim the  revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged but his application to the french colonial administrative school in  undermines this version of events he chose to leave school in order to find a chance to go abroad because his father had been dismissed he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward taking a position at dục thanh school in phan thiết for about six months then traveled to saigon thành worked as a kitchen helper on a french steamer the amirale de latouchetréville while using the alias văn ba the steamer departed on  june  and arrived in marseille france on  july  the ship then left for le havre and dunkirk returning to marseille in midseptember there he applied for the french colonial administrative school but his application was rejected instead he decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from  to  in the united statesedit in  while working as the cooks helper on a ship thành traveled to the united states from – he may have lived in new york city harlem and boston where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the parker house hotel the only evidence that thành was in the united states is a letter to french colonial administrators dated  december  and postmarked new york city but he gave as his address poste restante in le havre and stated that he was a sailor  and a postcard to phan chu trinh in paris where he mentioned working at the parker house hotel inquiries to the parker house management revealed no records of his ever having worked there among a series of menial jobs he claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in brooklyn between – and for general motors as a line manager it is believed that while in the united states he made contact with korean nationalists an experience that developed his political outlook but sophie quinnjudge admits that this is in the realm of conjecture in the united kingdomedit at various points between  and  thành claimed to have lived in west ealing and later in crouch end hornsey he reportedly worked as either a chef or dish washer reports vary at the drayton court hotel in west ealing it is claimed that he trained as a pastry chef under auguste escoffier at the carlton hotel in the haymarket westminster but there is no evidence to support this  however the wall of new zealand house home of the new zealand high commission which now stands on the site of the carlton hotel displays a blue plaque stating that hồ chí minh worked there in  thành was also employed as a pastry boy on the newhaven–dieppe ferry route in  political education in franceedit ho chi minh  from  to  while living in france thành began to show an interest in politics being influenced by his friend and socialist party of france comrade marcel cachin thành claimed to have arrived in paris from london in  but the french police only had documents recording his arrival in june  he joined a group of vietnamese nationalists in paris whose leaders were phan chu trinh phan văn trường and nguyễn thế truyền they had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for vietnamese independence under the pseudonym nguyễn ái quốc nguyễn the patriot prior to the arrival of nguyễn tất thành in paris in  following world war i the group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the vietnamese people in french indochina to the western powers at the versailles peace talks but was ignored citing the principle of selfdetermination outlined prior to the peace accords they requested the allied powers to end french colonial rule of vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government prior to the conference the group sent their letter to allied leaders including prime minister georges clemenceau and us president woodrow wilson they were unable to obtain consideration at versailles but the episode would later help establish nguyễn ái quốc as a symbol of the anticolonial movement at home in vietnam since nguyễn tất thành was the public face behind the publication of the document although it was written by phan văn trường he soon became known as nguyễn ái quốc and first used the name in september during an interview with a chinese newspaper correspondent a plaque in compoint lane district  paris indicates where ho chi minh lived from  many authors have speculated that  was a lost wilsonian moment when the future hồ chí minh could have adopted a proamerican and less radical position if only president wilson had received him however the available evidence shows that at the time of the versailles conference he was committed to a socialist program while the conference was ongoing nguyễn ái quốc was already delivering speeches on the prospects of bolshevism in asia and was attempting to persuade french socialists to join vladimir lenins third communist international in december  quốc officially became a representative to the congress of tours of the socialist party of france voted for the third international and was a founding member of the parti communiste français fcp taking a position in the colonial committee of the pcf he tried to draw his comrades attention towards people in french colonies including indochina but his efforts were often unsuccessful during this period he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as running his vietnamese nationalist group in may  quốc wrote an article for a french magazine criticizing the use of english words by french sportswriters the article implored

august revolution  organized by the viet minh ho became chairman of the provisional government premier of the democratic republic of vietnam and issued a proclamation of independence of the democratic republic of vietnam although he convinced emperor bảo đại to abdicate his government was not recognized by any country he repeatedly petitioned american president harry s truman for support for vietnamese independence citing the atlantic charter but truman never responded several sources relate how during a power struggle in  the viet minh killed members of rival groups such as the leader of the constitutional party bui quang chieu the head of the party for independence and ngo dinh diems brother ngo dinh khoi ho when asked by a reporter about the murder of ta thu thau a leading

notably members of the national party of vietnam and the dai viet national party after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the vietminh government all rival political parties were hereafter

minh political factions some without election npv party leader nguyễn hải thần was named vice president they also held four out of ten ministerial positions birth of the democratic republic of vietnamedit on  september  following emperor bảo đạis abdication ho read the declaration of independence of vietnam under the name of the democratic republic of vietnam in saigon with violence between rival vietnamese factions and french forces increasing the british commander general sir douglas gracey declared martial law on  september the viet minh leaders responded with a call for a general strike in september  a force of  republic of china army troops arrived in hanoi to accept the surrender of the japanese occupiers in northern indochina ho made a compromise with their general lu han to dissolve the communist party and to hold an election which would yield a coalition government when chiang forced the french to give the french concessions in shanghai back to china in exchange for withdrawing from northern indochina ho had no choice but to sign an agreement with france on  march  in which vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the indochinese federation and the french union the agreement soon broke down the purpose of the agreement for both the french and vietminh was for chiangs army to leave north vietnam fighting broke out in the north soon after the chinese left historian professor liam kelley of the university of hawaii at manoa on his le minh khais seasian history blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where hồ chí minh said he would rather sniff french shit than eat chinese shit noting that stanley karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to ho in his  vietnam a history and that the original quote was most likely forged by the frenchman paul mus in his  book viêtnam sociologie d’une guerre mus was a supporter of french colonialism in vietnam and ho knew that there was no danger of chinese troops staying in vietnam and in fact the vietnamese at the time were busy spreading antifrench propaganda as evidence of french atrocities in vietnam emerged while ho showed no qualms about accepting chinese aid after  hồ chí minh right with võ nguyên giáp left in hanoi  the viet minh then collaborated with french colonial forces to massacre supporters of the vietnamese nationalist movements in  the communists eventually suppressed all noncommunist parties but failed to secure a peace deal with france in the final days of  after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements such as the dalat and fontainebleau conferences the democratic republic of vietnam government found that war was inevitable the bombardment of haiphong by french forces at hanoi only strengthened the belief that france had no intention of allowing an autonomous independent state in vietnam on  december  ho representing his government declared war against the french union marking the beginning of the indochina war the vietnam national army by then mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked waging assault against french positions smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper destroying armored vehicles with lunge mines a hollowcharge warhead on the end of a pole detonated by thrusting the charge against the side of a tank typically a suicide weapon and molotov cocktails holding off attackers by using roadblocks landmines and gravel after two months of fighting the exhausted viet minh forces withdrew after systematically destroying any valuable infrastructure ho was reported to be captured by a group of french soldiers led by jeanétienne valluy at việt bắc in operation lea the person in question turned out to be a viet minh advisor who was later killed trying to escape according to journalist bernard fall after fighting the french for several years ho decided to negotiate a truce the french negotiators arrived at the meeting site a mud hut with a thatched roof inside they found a long table with chairs and were surprised to discover in one corner of the room a silver ice bucket containing ice and a bottle of good champagne which should have indicated that ho expected the negotiations to succeed one demand by the french was the return to french custody of a number of japanese military officers who had been helping the vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of japanese origin in order for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during world war ii ho replied that the japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray then he walked out to seven more years of war in february  after the successful removal of the french borders blockade ho met with stalin and mao zedong in moscow after the soviet union recognized his government they all agreed that china would be responsible for backing the viet minh maos emissary to moscow stated in august that china planned to train – viet minh in the near future the road to the outside world was open for viet minh forces to receive additional supplies which would allow them to escalate the fight against the french regime throughout indochina in  after the crushing defeat of french union forces at battle of dien bien phu france was forced to give up its fight against the viet minh the viet minh murdered between  and  civilians during the war becoming president and vietnam waredit effigies of charles degaulle and hồ chí minh are hanged by students demonstration in saigon july  observing the tenth anniversary of the july  geneva agreements the  geneva accords concluded between france and the viet minh allowing the latters forces to regroup in the north whilst anticommunist groups settled in the south hos democratic republic of vietnam relocated to hanoi and became the government of north vietnam a communistled oneparty state following the geneva accords there was to be a day period in which people could freely move between the two regions of vietnam later known as south vietnam and north vietnam more than  million north vietnamese people fled to the south a much smaller number moved north it is estimated that as many as two million more would have left had they not been stopped by the viet minh all the parties at geneva called for reunification elections but could not agree on the details recently appointed viet minh acting foreign minister pham van dong proposed elections under the supervision of local commissions the us with the support of britain and the associated states of vietnam laos and cambodia suggested un supervision this plan was rejected by soviet representative vyacheslav molotov who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and noncommunist members which could determine important issues only by unanimous agreement the negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification the drv argued that the elections should be held within  months of the ceasefire while the western allies sought to have no deadline molotov proposed june  then later softened this to any time in  and finally july  the diem government supported reunification elections but only with effective international supervision arguing that genuinely free elections were impossible in the totalitarian north by the afternoon of  july the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the th parallel and that the elections for reunification should be in july  two years after the ceasefire the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in vietnam was signed only by french and viet minh military commands completely bypassing the state of vietnam based on a proposal by chinese delegation head zhou enlai an international control commission icc chaired by india with canada and poland as members was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire because issues were to be decided unanimously polands presence in the icc provided the communists effective veto power over supervision of the treaty the unsigned final declaration of the geneva conference called for reunification elections which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the icc the viet minh never accepted icc authority over such elections stating that the iccs competence was to be

gambling on taking the south by force and defeating the us military the offensive came at great cost and with heavy casualties on nlfs political branches and armed forces it appeared to ho and to the rest of his government that the scope of the action had shocked the world which had up until then been assured that the communists were on the ropes the overly positive spin that the us military had been attempting to achieve for years came crashing down the bombing of northern vietnam and ho chi minh trail was halted and us and vietnamese negotiators began to discuss how to end the war from then

documents on the land reform vietnam studies group archived from the original on  april  retrieved  july  vu tuong there is no reason to expect and no evidence that i have seen to demonstrate that the actual executions were less than planned in fact the executions perhaps exceeded the plan if we consider two following factors first this decree was issued in  for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns or waves that followed during – second the decree was meant to apply to free areas under the control of the viet minh government not to the areas under french control that would be liberated in – and that would experience a far more violent struggle thus the number of  executed people seems to be a lowend estimate of the real number this is corroborated by edwin moise in his recent paper land reform in north vietnam – presented at the th annual conference on se asian studies center for se asian studies university of california berkeley february  in this paper moise – modified his earlier estimate in his  book which was  and accepted an estimate close to  executions moise made the case based on hungarian reports provided by balazs but the document i cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate this document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign the unauthorized killings at the local level and the suicides following arrest and torture the central government bore less

conference the group sent their letter to allied leaders including prime minister georges clemenceau and us president woodrow wilson they were unable to obtain consideration at versailles but the episode would later help establish nguyễn ái quốc as a symbol of the anticolonial movement at home in vietnam since nguyễn tất thành was the public face behind the publication of the document although it was written by phan văn trường he soon became known as nguyễn ái quốc and first used the name in september during an interview with a chinese newspaper correspondent a plaque in compoint lane district  paris indicates where ho chi minh lived from  many authors have speculated that  was a lost wilsonian moment when the future hồ chí minh could have adopted a proamerican and less radical

challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where hồ chí minh said he would rather sniff french shit than eat chinese shit noting that stanley karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to ho in his  vietnam a history and that the original quote was most likely forged by the frenchman paul mus in his  book viêtnam sociologie d’une guerre mus was a supporter of french colonialism in vietnam and ho knew that there was no danger of chinese troops staying in vietnam and in fact the vietnamese at the time were busy spreading antifrench propaganda as evidence of french atrocities in vietnam emerged while ho showed no qualms about accepting chinese aid after  hồ chí minh right with võ nguyên giáp left in hanoi  the viet minh then collaborated with french colonial

truce the french negotiators arrived at the meeting site a mud hut with a thatched roof inside they found a long table with chairs and were surprised to discover in one corner of the room a silver ice bucket containing ice and a bottle of good champagne which should have indicated that ho expected the negotiations to succeed one demand by the french was the return to french custody of a number of

with the support of britain and the associated states of vietnam laos and cambodia suggested un supervision this plan was rejected by soviet representative vyacheslav molotov who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and noncommunist members which could determine important issues only by unanimous agreement the negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification the drv argued that the elections should be held within  months of the ceasefire while the western allies sought to have no deadline molotov proposed june  then later softened this to any time in  and finally july  the diem government supported reunification elections but only with effective international supervision arguing that genuinely free elections were impossible in the totalitarian north by the afternoon of  july the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the th parallel and that the

cong planned to execute the tet offensive to begin on  january  gambling on taking the south by force and defeating the us military the offensive came at great cost and with heavy casualties on nlfs political branches and armed forces it appeared to ho and to the rest of his government that the scope of the action had shocked the world which had up until then been assured that the communists were on the ropes the overly positive spin that the us military had been attempting to achieve for years came crashing down the bombing of northern vietnam and ho chi minh trail was halted and us and vietnamese negotiators began to discuss how to end the war from then on ho and his governments strategy based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the us army which

expect and no evidence that i have seen to demonstrate that the actual executions were less than planned in fact the executions perhaps exceeded the plan if we consider two following factors first this decree was issued in  for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns or waves that followed during – second the decree was meant to apply to free areas under the control of the viet minh government not to the areas under french control that would be liberated in – and that would experience a far more violent struggle thus the number of  executed people seems to be a lowend estimate of the real number this is corroborated by edwin moise in his recent paper land reform in north vietnam – presented at the th annual conference on se asian studies center for se asian studies university of california berkeley february  in this paper moise – modified his earlier estimate in his  book which was  and accepted an estimate close to  executions moise made the case based on hungarian reports provided by balazs but the document i cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate this document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign the unauthorized killings at the local level and the suicides following arrest and torture the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases however cs maint bot originalurl status unknown link cf szalontai balazs november

of hoàng trù the name of the local temple near làng sen his mothers village from  he grew up in his father nguyễn sinh sắc nguyễn sinh huys village of làng sen kim liên nam đàn nghệ an province he had three siblings his sister bạch liên or nguyễn thị thanh a clerk in the french army his brother nguyễn sinh khiêm or nguyễn tất đạt a geomancer and traditional herbalist and another brother nguyễn sinh nhuận who died in his infancy as a young child cung studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named vuong thuc do cung quickly mastered chinese writing a prerequisite for any serious study of confucianism while honing his colloquial vietnamese writing in addition to his studious endeavors he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing following confucian tradition at the age of  his father gave him a new name nguyễn tất thành nguyễn the accomplished thànhs father was a confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of binh khe qui nhơn he was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received  strokes of the cane as punishment for an infractionthànhs father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy but refused because it meant serving the french this exposed thành to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province where thành came of age the province was known for its resistance to foreign rule in deference to his father thành received a french education attended lycée in huế the alma mater of his later disciples phạm văn đồng and võ nguyên giáp and his later enemy ngô đình diệm first sojourn in franceedit previously it was believed that thành was involved in an antislavery anticorvée demonstration of poor peasants in huế in may  which endangered his student status at collège quốc học however a document from the centre des archives doutremer in france shows that he was admitted to collège quốc học on  august  which was several months after the anticorvée demonstration – april  the exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among vietnamese communist leaders as shown in tôn đức thắngs falsified participation in the  black sea revolt later in life hồ would claim the  revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged but his application to the french colonial administrative school in  undermines this version of events he chose to leave school in order to find a chance to go abroad because his father had been dismissed he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward taking a position at dục thanh school in phan thiết for about six months then traveled to saigon thành worked as a kitchen helper on a french steamer the amirale de latouchetréville while using the alias văn ba the steamer departed on  june  and arrived in marseille france on  july  the ship then left for le havre and dunkirk returning to marseille in midseptember there he applied for the french colonial administrative school but his application was rejected instead he decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from  to  in the united statesedit in  while working as the cooks helper on a ship thành traveled to the united states from – he may have lived in new york city harlem and boston where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the parker house hotel the only evidence that thành was in the united states is a letter to french colonial administrators dated  december  and postmarked new york city but he gave as his address poste restante in le havre and stated that he was a sailor  and a postcard to phan chu trinh in paris where he mentioned working at the parker house hotel inquiries to the parker house management revealed no records of his ever having worked there among a series of menial jobs he claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in brooklyn between – and for general motors as a line manager it is believed that while in the united states he made contact with korean nationalists an experience that developed his political outlook but sophie quinnjudge admits that this is in the realm of conjecture in the united kingdomedit at various points between  and  thành claimed to have lived in west ealing and later in crouch end hornsey he reportedly worked as either a chef or dish washer reports vary at the drayton court hotel in west ealing it is claimed that he trained as a pastry chef under auguste escoffier at the carlton hotel in the haymarket westminster but there is no evidence to support this  however the wall of new zealand house home of the new zealand high commission which now stands on the site of the carlton hotel displays a blue plaque stating that hồ chí minh worked there in  thành was also employed as a pastry boy on the newhaven–dieppe ferry route in  political education in franceedit ho chi minh  from  to  while living in france thành began to show an interest in politics being influenced by his friend and socialist party of france comrade marcel cachin thành claimed to have arrived in paris from london in  but the french police only had documents recording his arrival in june  he joined a group of vietnamese nationalists in paris whose leaders were phan chu trinh phan văn trường and nguyễn thế truyền they had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for vietnamese independence under the pseudonym nguyễn ái quốc nguyễn the patriot prior to the arrival of nguyễn tất thành in paris in  following world war i the group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the vietnamese people in french indochina to the western powers at the versailles peace talks but was ignored citing the principle of selfdetermination outlined prior to the peace accords they requested the allied powers to end french colonial rule of vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government prior to the conference the group sent their letter to allied leaders including prime minister georges clemenceau and us president woodrow wilson they were unable to obtain consideration at versailles but the episode would later help establish nguyễn ái quốc as a symbol of the anticolonial movement at home in vietnam since nguyễn tất thành was the public face behind the publication of the document although it was written by phan văn trường he soon became known as nguyễn ái quốc and first used the name in september during an interview with a chinese newspaper correspondent a plaque in compoint lane district  paris indicates where ho chi minh lived from  many authors have speculated that  was a lost wilsonian moment when the future hồ chí minh could have adopted a proamerican and less radical position if only president wilson had received him however the available evidence shows that at the time of the versailles conference he was committed to a socialist program while the conference was ongoing nguyễn ái quốc was already delivering speeches on the prospects of bolshevism in asia and was attempting to persuade french socialists to join vladimir lenins third communist international in december  quốc officially became a representative to the congress of tours of the socialist party of france voted for the third international and was a founding member of the parti communiste français fcp taking a position in the colonial committee of the pcf he tried to draw his comrades attention towards people in french colonies including indochina but his efforts were often unsuccessful during this period he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as running his vietnamese nationalist group in may  quốc wrote an article for a french magazine criticizing the use of english

the french concessions in shanghai back to china in exchange for withdrawing from northern indochina ho had no choice but to sign an agreement with france on  march  in which vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the indochinese federation and the french union the agreement soon broke down the purpose of the agreement for both the french and vietminh was for chiangs army to leave north vietnam fighting broke out in the north soon after the chinese left historian professor liam kelley of the university of hawaii at manoa on his le minh khais seasian history blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where hồ chí minh said he would rather sniff french shit than eat chinese shit noting that stanley karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to ho in his  vietnam a history and that the original quote was most likely forged by the frenchman paul mus in his  book viêtnam sociologie d’une guerre mus was a supporter of french colonialism in vietnam and ho knew that there was no danger of chinese troops staying in vietnam and in fact the vietnamese at the time were busy spreading antifrench propaganda as evidence of french atrocities in vietnam emerged while ho showed no qualms about accepting chinese aid after  hồ chí minh right with võ nguyên giáp left in hanoi  the viet minh then collaborated with french colonial forces to massacre supporters of the vietnamese nationalist movements in  the communists eventually suppressed all noncommunist parties but failed to secure a peace deal with france in the final days

government declared war against the french union marking the beginning of the indochina war the vietnam national army by then mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked waging assault against french positions smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper destroying armored vehicles with lunge mines a hollowcharge warhead on the end of a pole detonated by thrusting the

truce the french negotiators arrived at the meeting site a mud hut with a thatched roof inside they found a long table with chairs and were surprised to discover in one corner of the room a silver ice bucket containing ice and a bottle of good champagne which should have indicated that ho expected the negotiations to succeed one demand by the french was the return to french custody of a number of japanese military officers who had been helping the vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of japanese origin in order for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during world war ii ho replied that the japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray then he walked out to seven more years of war in february  after the successful removal of the

for reunification elections but could not agree on the details recently appointed viet minh acting foreign minister pham van dong proposed elections under the supervision of local commissions the us with the support of britain and the associated states of vietnam laos and cambodia suggested un supervision this plan was rejected by soviet representative vyacheslav molotov who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and noncommunist members which could determine important issues only by unanimous agreement the negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification the drv argued that the elections should be held within  months of the ceasefire while the western allies sought to have no deadline molotov proposed june  then later softened this to any time in  and finally july  the diem government supported reunification elections but only with effective international supervision arguing that genuinely free elections were impossible in the totalitarian north by the afternoon of  july the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the th parallel and that the elections for reunification should be in july  two years after the ceasefire the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in vietnam was signed only by french and viet minh military commands completely bypassing the state of vietnam based on a proposal by chinese delegation head zhou enlai an international control commission icc chaired by india with canada and poland as members was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire because issues were to be decided unanimously polands presence in the icc provided the communists effective veto power over supervision of the treaty the unsigned final declaration of the geneva conference called for reunification elections which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the icc the viet minh never accepted icc authority over such elections stating that the iccs competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities by both parties of the nine

including rent reduction and land reform which resulted in significant political oppression during the land reform testimony from north vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every  village residents which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly  executions because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the red river delta area a lower estimate of  executions became

ho chi minh trail which allowed the north to send troops and aid to the vietcong through laos and cambodia thus escalating the war and tipping the balance turning it to their favor duan was officially

cong planned to execute the tet offensive to begin on  january  gambling on taking the south by force and defeating the us military the offensive came at great cost and with heavy casualties on nlfs political branches and armed forces it appeared to ho and to the rest of his government that the scope of the action had shocked the world which had up until then been assured that the communists were on the ropes the overly positive spin that the us military had been attempting to achieve for years came crashing down the bombing of northern vietnam and ho chi minh trail was halted and us and vietnamese negotiators began to discuss how to end the war from then on ho and his governments strategy based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the us army which

expect and no evidence that i have seen to demonstrate that the actual executions were less than planned in fact the executions perhaps exceeded the plan if we consider two following factors first this decree was issued in  for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns or waves that followed during – second the decree was meant to apply to free areas under the control of the viet minh government not to the areas under french control that would be liberated in – and that would experience a far more violent struggle thus the number of  executed people seems to be a lowend estimate of the real number this is corroborated by edwin moise in his recent paper land reform in north vietnam – presented at the th annual conference on se asian studies center for se asian studies university of california berkeley february  in this paper moise – modified his earlier estimate in his  book which was  and accepted an estimate close to  executions moise made the case based on hungarian reports provided by balazs but the document i cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate this document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign the unauthorized killings at the local level and the

anticorvée demonstration – april  the exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among vietnamese communist leaders as shown in tôn đức thắngs falsified participation in the  black sea revolt later in life hồ would claim the  revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged but his application to the french colonial administrative school in  undermines this version of events he chose to leave school in order to find a chance to go abroad because his father had been dismissed he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward taking a

court hotel in west ealing it is claimed that he trained as a pastry chef under auguste escoffier at the carlton hotel in the haymarket westminster but there is no evidence to support this  however

accords they requested the allied powers to end french colonial rule of vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government prior to the conference the group sent their letter to allied leaders including prime minister georges clemenceau and us president woodrow wilson they were unable to obtain consideration at versailles but the episode would later help establish nguyễn ái quốc as a symbol of the anticolonial movement at home in vietnam since nguyễn tất thành was the public face behind the publication of the document although it was written by phan văn trường he soon became known as nguyễn ái quốc and first used the name in september during an interview with a chinese newspaper correspondent a plaque in compoint lane district  paris indicates where ho chi minh lived from  many authors have speculated that  was a lost wilsonian moment when the future hồ chí minh could have adopted a proamerican and less radical position if only president wilson had received him however

withdrawing from northern indochina ho had no choice but to sign an agreement with france on  march  in which vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the indochinese federation and the french union the agreement soon broke down the purpose of the agreement for both the french and vietminh was for chiangs army to leave north vietnam fighting broke out in the north soon after the chinese left historian professor liam kelley of the university of hawaii at manoa on his le minh khais seasian history blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where hồ chí minh said he would rather sniff french shit than eat chinese shit noting that stanley karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to ho in his  vietnam a history and that the original quote was most likely forged by the frenchman paul mus in his  book viêtnam sociologie d’une guerre mus was a supporter of french colonialism in vietnam and ho knew that there was no danger of chinese troops staying in vietnam and in fact the vietnamese at the time were busy spreading antifrench propaganda as evidence of french atrocities in vietnam emerged while ho showed no qualms about accepting chinese aid after  hồ chí minh right with võ nguyên giáp left in hanoi  the viet minh then collaborated with french colonial forces to massacre supporters of the vietnamese nationalist movements in  the communists eventually suppressed all noncommunist parties but failed to secure a peace deal with france in the final days of  after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements

the indochina war the vietnam national army by then mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked waging assault against french positions smoking them out with straw bundled with chili

later killed trying to escape according to journalist bernard fall after fighting the french for several years ho decided to negotiate a truce the french negotiators arrived at the meeting site a mud hut with a thatched roof inside they found a long table with chairs and were surprised to discover in one corner of the room a silver ice bucket containing ice and a bottle of good champagne which should have indicated that ho expected the negotiations to succeed one demand by the french was the return to french custody of a number of japanese military officers who had been helping the vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of japanese origin in order for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during world war ii ho replied that the japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray then he walked out to seven more years of war in february  after the successful removal of the french borders blockade ho met with stalin and mao zedong in moscow after the soviet union recognized his government they all agreed that china would be responsible for backing the viet minh maos emissary to moscow stated in august that china planned

estimated that as many as two million more would have left had they not been stopped by the viet minh all the parties at geneva called for reunification elections but could not agree on the details recently appointed viet minh acting foreign minister pham van dong proposed elections under the supervision of local commissions the us with the support of britain and the associated states of vietnam laos and cambodia suggested un supervision this plan was rejected by soviet representative vyacheslav molotov who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and noncommunist members which could determine important issues only by unanimous agreement the negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification the drv argued that the elections should be held within  months of the ceasefire while the western allies sought to have no deadline molotov proposed june  then later softened this to any time in  and finally july  the diem government supported reunification elections but only with effective international supervision arguing that genuinely free elections were impossible in the totalitarian north by the afternoon of  july the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the th parallel and that the elections for reunification should be in july  two years after the ceasefire the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in vietnam was signed only by french and viet minh military commands completely bypassing the state of vietnam based on a proposal by chinese delegation head zhou enlai an international control commission icc chaired by india with canada and poland as members was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire because issues were to be decided unanimously polands presence in the icc provided the communists effective veto power over supervision of the treaty the unsigned final declaration of the geneva conference called for reunification elections which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the icc the viet minh never accepted icc authority over such elections stating that the iccs competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities by both parties of the nine nations represented only the united states and the state of vietnam refused to accept the declaration us undersecretary of state walter bedell smith delivered a unilateral declaration of the us position reiterating we shall seek to achieve unity through free

of the east german young pioneers near berlin  between  and  the north vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms including rent reduction and land reform which resulted in significant political oppression during the land reform testimony from north vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every  village residents which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly  executions because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the red river delta area a lower estimate of  executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time however declassified documents from the vietnamese and hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time although likely greater than  at the end of  lê duẩn was appointed

position north vietnam invaded laos in  aided by the pathet lao and used  men to build invasion and supply routes through laos known as the ho chi minh trail which allowed the north to send troops and aid to the vietcong through laos and cambodia thus escalating the war and tipping the balance turning it to their favor duan was officially named party leader in  leaving ho a public figure rather

vietnam met in a highprofile conference where they all concluded the war had fallen into a stalemate since the united states army presence forced the peoples army of vietnam to expend the majority of their resources maintaining the ho chi minh trail instead of reinforcing their comrades ranks in the south with hos permission the viet cong planned to execute the tet offensive to begin on  january  gambling on taking the south by force and defeating the us military the offensive came at great cost and with heavy casualties on nlfs political branches and armed forces it appeared to ho and to the rest of his government that the scope of the action had shocked the world which had up until then been assured that the communists were on the ropes the overly positive spin that the us military had been attempting to achieve for years came crashing down the bombing of northern vietnam and ho chi minh trail was halted and us and vietnamese negotiators began to discuss how to end the war from then on ho and his governments strategy based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the us army which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict

documents on the land reform vietnam studies group archived from the original on  april  retrieved  july  vu tuong there is no reason to expect and no evidence that i have seen to demonstrate that the actual executions were less than planned in fact the executions perhaps exceeded the plan if we consider two following factors first this decree was issued in  for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns or waves that followed during – second the decree was meant to apply to free areas under the control of the viet minh government not to the areas under french control that would be liberated in – and that would experience a far more violent struggle thus the number of  executed people seems to be a lowend estimate of the real number this is corroborated by edwin moise in his recent paper land reform in north vietnam – presented at the th annual conference on se asian studies center for se asian studies university of california berkeley february  in this paper moise – modified his earlier estimate in his  book which was  and accepted an estimate close to  executions moise made the case based on hungarian reports provided by balazs but the document i cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate this document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign the unauthorized killings at the local level and the suicides following arrest and torture the central government bore less

three siblings his sister bạch liên or nguyễn thị thanh a clerk in the french army his brother nguyễn sinh khiêm or nguyễn tất đạt a geomancer and traditional herbalist and another brother nguyễn sinh nhuận who died in his infancy as a young child cung studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named vuong thuc do cung quickly mastered chinese writing a prerequisite for any serious study of confucianism while honing his colloquial vietnamese writing in addition to his studious endeavors he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing following confucian tradition at the age of  his father gave him a new name nguyễn tất thành nguyễn the accomplished thànhs father was a confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of binh khe qui nhơn he was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received  strokes of the cane as punishment for an infractionthànhs father was eligible to serve in the imperial bureaucracy but refused because it meant serving the french this exposed thành to rebellion at a young age and seemed to be the norm for the province where thành came of age the province was known for its resistance to foreign rule in deference to his father thành received a french education attended lycée in huế the alma mater of his later disciples phạm văn đồng and võ nguyên giáp and his later enemy ngô đình diệm first sojourn in franceedit previously it was believed that thành was involved in an antislavery anticorvée demonstration of poor peasants in huế in may  which endangered his student status at collège quốc học however a document from the centre des archives doutremer in france shows that he was admitted to collège quốc học on  august  which was several months after the anticorvée demonstration – april  the exaggeration of revolutionary credentials was common among vietnamese communist leaders as shown in tôn đức thắngs falsified participation in the  black sea revolt later in life hồ would claim the  revolt had been the moment when his revolutionary outlook emerged but his application to the french colonial administrative school in  undermines this version of events he chose to leave school in order to find a chance to go abroad because his father had been dismissed he no longer had any hope for a governmental scholarship and went southward taking a position at dục thanh school in phan thiết for about six months then traveled to saigon thành worked as a kitchen helper on a french steamer the amirale de latouchetréville while using the alias văn ba the steamer departed on  june  and arrived in marseille france on  july  the ship then left for le havre and dunkirk returning to marseille in midseptember there he applied for the french colonial administrative school but his application was rejected instead he decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visited many countries from  to  in the united statesedit in  while working as the cooks helper on a ship thành traveled to the united states from – he may have lived in new york city harlem and boston where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the parker house hotel the only evidence that thành was in the united states is a letter to french colonial administrators dated  december  and postmarked new york city but he gave as his address poste restante in le havre and stated that he was a sailor  and a postcard to phan chu trinh in paris where he mentioned working at the parker house hotel inquiries to the parker house management revealed no records of his ever having worked there among a series of menial jobs he claimed to have worked for a wealthy family in brooklyn between – and for general motors as a line manager it is believed that while in the united states he made contact with korean nationalists an experience that developed his political outlook but sophie quinnjudge admits that this is in the realm of conjecture in the united kingdomedit at various points between  and  thành claimed to have lived in west ealing and later in crouch end hornsey he reportedly worked as either a chef or dish washer reports vary at the drayton court hotel in west ealing it is claimed that he trained as a pastry chef under auguste escoffier at the carlton hotel in the haymarket westminster but there is no evidence to support this  however the wall of new zealand house home of the new zealand high commission which now stands on the site of the carlton hotel displays a blue plaque stating that hồ chí minh worked there in  thành was also employed as a pastry boy on the newhaven–dieppe ferry route in  political education in franceedit ho chi minh  from  to  while living in france thành began to show an interest in politics being influenced by his friend and socialist party of france comrade marcel cachin thành claimed to have arrived in paris from london in  but the french police only had documents recording his arrival in june  he joined a group of vietnamese nationalists in paris whose leaders were phan chu trinh phan văn trường and nguyễn thế truyền they had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for vietnamese independence under the pseudonym nguyễn ái quốc nguyễn the patriot prior to the arrival of nguyễn tất thành in paris in  following world war i the group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the vietnamese people in french indochina to the western powers at the versailles peace talks but was ignored citing the principle of selfdetermination outlined prior to the peace accords they requested the allied powers to end french colonial rule of vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government prior to the conference the group sent their letter to allied leaders including prime minister georges clemenceau and us president woodrow wilson they were unable to obtain consideration at versailles but the episode would later help establish nguyễn ái quốc as a symbol of the anticolonial movement at home in vietnam since nguyễn tất thành was the public face behind the publication of the document although it was written by phan văn trường he soon became known as nguyễn ái quốc and first used the name in september during an interview with a chinese newspaper correspondent a plaque in compoint lane district  paris indicates where ho chi minh lived from  many authors have speculated that  was a lost wilsonian moment when the future hồ chí minh could have adopted a proamerican and less radical position if only president wilson had received him however the available evidence shows that at the time of the versailles conference he was committed to a socialist program while the conference was ongoing nguyễn ái quốc was already delivering speeches on the prospects of bolshevism in asia and was attempting to persuade french socialists to join vladimir lenins third communist international in december  quốc officially became a representative to the congress of tours of the socialist party of france voted for the third international and was a founding member of the parti communiste français fcp taking a position in the colonial committee of the pcf he tried to draw his comrades attention towards people in french colonies including indochina but his efforts were often unsuccessful during

recognized as an autonomous state in the indochinese federation and the french union the agreement soon broke down the purpose of the agreement for both the french and vietminh was for chiangs army to leave north vietnam fighting broke out in the north soon after the chinese left historian professor liam kelley of the university of hawaii at manoa on his le minh khais seasian history blog challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where hồ chí minh said he would rather sniff french shit than eat chinese shit noting that stanley karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to ho in his  vietnam a history and that the original quote was most likely forged by the frenchman paul mus in his  book viêtnam sociologie d’une guerre mus was a supporter of french colonialism in vietnam and ho knew that there was no danger of chinese troops staying in vietnam and in fact the vietnamese at the time were busy spreading antifrench propaganda as evidence of french atrocities in vietnam emerged while ho showed no qualms about accepting chinese aid after  hồ chí minh right with võ nguyên giáp left in hanoi  the viet minh then collaborated with french colonial forces to massacre supporters of the vietnamese nationalist movements in  the communists eventually suppressed all noncommunist parties but failed to secure a peace deal with france in the final days

truce the french negotiators arrived at the meeting site a mud hut with a thatched roof inside they found a long table with chairs and were surprised to discover in one corner of the room a silver ice bucket containing ice and a bottle of good champagne which should have indicated that ho expected the negotiations to succeed one demand by the french was the return to french custody of a number of japanese military officers who had been helping the vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of japanese origin in order for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during world war ii ho replied that the japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray then he walked out to seven more years of war in february  after the successful removal of the

for reunification elections but could not agree on the details recently appointed viet minh acting foreign minister pham van dong proposed elections under the supervision of local commissions the us with the support of britain and the associated states of vietnam laos and cambodia suggested un supervision this plan was rejected by soviet representative vyacheslav molotov who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and noncommunist members which could determine important issues only by unanimous agreement the negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification the drv argued that the elections should be held within  months of the ceasefire while the western allies sought to have no deadline molotov proposed june  then later softened this to any time in  and finally july  the diem government supported reunification elections but only with effective international supervision arguing that genuinely free elections were impossible in the totalitarian north by the afternoon of  july the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the th parallel and that the elections for reunification should be in july  two years after the ceasefire the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in vietnam was signed only by french and viet minh military commands completely bypassing the state of vietnam based on a proposal by chinese delegation head zhou enlai an international control commission icc chaired by india with canada and poland as members was

cong planned to execute the tet offensive to begin on  january  gambling on taking the south by force and defeating the us military the offensive came at great cost and with heavy casualties on nlfs political branches and armed forces it appeared to ho and to the rest of his government that the scope of the action had shocked the world which had up until then been assured that the communists were on the ropes the overly positive spin that the us military had been attempting to achieve for years came crashing down the bombing of northern vietnam and ho chi minh trail was halted and us and vietnamese negotiators began to discuss how to end the war from then on ho and his governments strategy based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the us army which

expect and no evidence that i have seen to demonstrate that the actual executions were less than planned in fact the executions perhaps exceeded the plan if we consider two following factors first this decree was issued in  for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns or waves that followed during – second the decree was meant to apply to free areas under the control of the viet minh government not to the areas under french control that would be liberated in – and that would experience a far more violent struggle thus the number of  executed people seems to be a lowend estimate of the real number this is corroborated by edwin moise in his recent paper land reform in north vietnam – presented at the th annual conference on se asian studies center for se asian studies university of california berkeley february  in this paper moise – modified his earlier estimate in his  book which was  and accepted an estimate close to  executions moise made the case based on hungarian reports provided by balazs but the document i cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate this document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign the unauthorized killings at the local level and the suicides following arrest and torture the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases however cs maint bot originalurl status unknown link cf szalontai balazs november
