printing press feeder static  printing paper static  ionix                     we eliminate static differently  since  ionix static eliminators for feeder in printing presses die cutters laminators and other sheet feeding machines feeding paper or plastic static on the paper or plastic surfaces of the sheets in the machine feeder cause sheets to be electrically attracted to each other and resist sheet separation by the feeder this causes either feeder jams or slower running speeds installing ionix static eliminators in your feeder air line makes your feeder air eliminate those interior surface charges during  sheet separation the result is no feeder jams and consistently increased running speeds on your machines explanation of ionix static eliminators in sheet feeders static on the surfaces of paper causes the sheets to be electrically not magnetically attracted the sheets are attracted because there are opposing charges on each sheet one sheet has a positive charge and the facing side has a negative charge opposing static charges will neutralize each other is they are allowed to come in electrical contact with each other however in the paper stack the in feeder while to the naked eye it appears the sheets are touching in reality there is a thin layer of air insulating the sheets preventing the opposing charges from conducting to one another when installed in the main feeder blastpressure air line the feeder pump forces air through ionix air enters the ionix acting like an electrical insulator and exits our unit acting like an electrical conductor like copper wire when the feeder blows into the feeder the air that was originally in the paper pile acting as electrical insulator is blown out and replaced with ionix air acting as an electrical conductor the charges on the interior paper surfaces that were before electrically isolated from each other by the air are now able to conduct through the ionix electrically conductive air the opposing charges on the paper surfaces conduct to each other through the ionix air and ground each other out why ionix is superior to electronic ionizers in sheet feeders electronic ionizers create a stream of charged air molecules it produces a rapid succession of a pulse of negatively charged air and then a pulse of positively charged air that air is directed into the paper stack when a blast of charged air meets an opposing charge the ionized air and paper static charges neutralize each other at that point the air has no more ability to neutralize a charge because it’s charge was used to eliminate a charge the ionized air is consumed in the process of eliminating the static also since opposing charges are attracted to one another and will neutralize each other an ionization air stream will neutralize itself within about ” inches therefore the effective range for ionization is only about ” into a stack of paper before it recombines on itself ionix has neither of these drawbacks since ionix makes the air electrically conductive it is not consumed in the process of neutralizing static ionix treated air is as effective at the rear of the sheet as it is in the front the only thing that diminishes the performance of the ionix treated air is when the ambient air mixes in with the treated ionix air secondly since ionix does not ionize the air it does not neutralize itself like an ionizer there is no recombinant or neutralizing itself effect like there is with ionized air when the compressor air goes through the ionix the feeder mechanism blows out the air between the paper sheets which is acting like an electrical insulator and replaces it with ionix air that acts like an electrical conductor which discharges the static on the interior surfaces of the paper this eliminates the static attraction within the paper in the feeder simple to install  ionix is installed on the main blowpressure line going from the feeder pump to the feeder for optimum results all the air coming from the feeder pump should  go through the ionix static eliminator identify that hose and measure the inside diameter of the hose cut that hose and push the hose ends over ionix installation is complete no electrical wiring is necessary if you machine has more than one feeder pump  such as a side blower pump  that pump must also be equipped with ionix sizing ionix for sheet fed presses diecutters and other sheet feeding machines feeding paper ionix for presses are sized based upon  the maximum sheet size of the press and  the inside diameter of the main blower air hose therefore in order to install ionix on a sheet feeding press you must have this information for sheet  feeding machines up to  mm x  mm sheet size for  mm inside diameter feeder air hose ionix model  for  mm inside

or synthetic sheets install two of the appropriate size ionix for your press in series one ionix after another separated by a short section of hose for presses other than sheet fed presses sheeters or sheet fed presses greater than  x  please contact ionix at infoionixtechnologiescom for sizing static on press feeder boards resulting in misregister at head stops sometimes press operators will experience paper that will separate and feed but the sheets will not uniformly feed down the feeder board either sheets will not jog to the head stops or will not be pulled by the side guide this particular static problem is caused by the friction of the feeder tapes moving over the surface of the feeder board the feeder tapes have a static charge on them which attracts the paper to it while going down the feeder board to eliminate feeder board static ionix air must be blown between the bottom of the paper going down the feeder board and the top of the feeder board since virtually all machines do not have air delivery to these point it is necessary to fabricate an air delivery system for each particular machine please contact ionix and we will help you install an appropriate air delivery system for your machine ionix static eliminators in offset spray powder units improve powder laydown resulting in less powder use ionix installation in spray powder systems results in less powder usage and more even spreading of powder since offset powder is an electrical insulator when the air pump blows into the offset spray powder static is generated on the powder by the friction of the moving powder  the static charge on the powder causes the powder to stick together therefore you get excessive powder usage and uneven powder application when you install an ionix in the air line going from the pump to the spray powder unit the offset spray powder system is static free the ionix treated air which enters the spray powder system eliminates any static present in the powder and prevents its buildup less powder is needed since the powder lays down thinner and broader you will also have less powder buildup on your presses install the ionix in the pressure air hose going from the compressor to the spray powder unit for spray powder units in presses up to  mm x  mm for  mm inside diameter spray powder air hose ionix model  for  mm inside diameter spray powder air hose ionix

delivery problems in a sheet fed press however since there is no air handling system in the delivery of sheet fed presses ionix cannot be used to eliminate static delivery problems in sheet fed presses if it occurs remember that static eliminators are only effective in eliminating static at the point they are installed static eliminators are not static preventers if you do have static in your delivery installing a static eliminator in your feeder will not solve the static problem in the delivery contact ionix if you are having difficulties with static in press deliveries and we will attempt to help you solve the problem static in web press sheeters generally most static issues in web presses occur in the forming cone or at the sheeter cutoff ionix has been successfully used in web presses please contact ionix for more details  day satisfaction guarantee use ionix for  days if your not completely satisfied with your ionix static eliminator you can return it in any condition

rv motorcycle painting perfect finishes are the direct result of superior surface preparation before spraying this is especially true of painting plastic or rubber parts the surfaces must be free of static to prevent the attraction of airborne dust ionix static eliminators are safe to use in class  division  groups c  d explosion proof environments redos are costly it is more cost effective for shops to paint perfectly the first time redos cost you money using an ionix static eliminator will pay for itself in  hours at  per hour shop rate all ionix has to do is save you  hours of rework labor and after that youre making money using the ionix static eliminator what causes dust and fisheyes in my paint job static on the surface which can be caused by many factors too numerous to list here attracts and holds dust which when painted dries as a fisheye or blemish blowing compressed air over the surface does not dissipate the surface static if fact the high air velocities of compressed air blowing on a surface an actually make static worse since the friction of the rapidly flowing air over the surface creates surface static all the compressed air does during blowoff is physically push the static charged dust into the air only to be reattracted to the surface later by using an ionix static eliminator during blowoff and tacking you actually dissipate any static present on the surface and on the dust particles prior to painting so neither the surface or the dust are electrically charged and therefore attracted to each other tacking isnt sufficient to prep surfaces for perfect finishes ionix is superior to tacking since tack cloths only pick up loose dust on the surface the real problem is static on the surface to be painted causes dust to be attracted to the surface unless you eliminate that surface static the dust will return after tacking and you will have reworks tacking creates static tack cloths have a slight adhesive that causes the dust to stick to the cloth however adhesives pulled from or across a surface cause static you can prove it at your desk a roll of scotch tape is like a tack cloth it has an adhesive backing quickly pull the tape out of the dispenser and then place your forearm close to the gap where the tape separates from the roll you can feel the static charge at that gap through the hairs on your forearm if you put them close to the gap the adhesive pulling from the roll like a tack cloth across a surface creates static so even after you tack the static created during tacking will attract more dust which appears as fisheyes or blemishes in your paint jobs ionix actually eliminates surface static which attracts and holds dust to the surface plus tacking is expensive to do because it uses so much labor time and their cost tack cloths retail for about  each if you go through one every  days its cheaper to use ionix and that doesnt even account for the savings in labor dollars it takes to tack surfaces plus  you can blow off the car between coats many painters experience dust on the base coat when theyre ready to clear coat with ionix you can give an additional quick static elimination before the clear coat simple to install  you do not have to use a special hose or air gun to use ionix ionix static eliminators can be installed anywhere in the blowoff air line ionix fits standard  id air hoses if you have only one air line shared for both blowoff and painting when youre ready to blow off the surface attach the ionix static eliminator to the end of the air hose blowoff and tack and then remove ionix static eliminator from the air hose and attach paint gun to the air hose when your ready to paint if you have a dedicated air line for blowoff you can install the ionix static eliminator at the line drop after the regulator ionix does not need to be at the end of the air line to be effective the length of the air hose ionix is installed on does not diminish its ability to dissipate static on the surface simple to use its so simple to use that any painter can intuitively understand how to use it just blow off as you normally do and ionix will do the rest of the work which model should i

simple  cost effective how the ionix static elimination process works ionix static eliminators are installed in a compressed air line blowing onto the surface or into spaces you are trying to eliminate the static this can be a hand held air line an automated blow off air line or air separating mechanical feeding system this new technology allows compressed air to act as an electrical conductor after being forced through the ionix unit ionix eliminates static charges on surfaces by providing a non destructive dissipative path through the treated air to the attracting opposing electrical charge or electrical ground therefore as a dissipative process ionix units can automatically and reliably eliminate either positive or negative charges since the process is dissipative metal in proximity to the ionix has no detrimental effect on its performance ionix is especially effective in applications where traditional ionization is not effective ionix is nonnuclear and environmentally harmless it can safely be used in hazardous environments or where flammable coatings or materials are present since it can be installed in any air line regardless of the presence of metal or distance from the ionix to the air nozzle ionix static eliminators can be used in a wide variety of industries and applications with little or no modification to your existing equipment in a majority of installations the only installation required is inserting the ionix in an air hose why ionix static eliminators are superior to electronic ionizers and nuclear ionizers many customers have switched from more expensive high voltage ionizers to ionix static eliminators first customers who have used ionizers find they have to replace ionizers more often than replacing ionix second ionix has a much less installation cost there is no wiring just cut the hose ends and push hoses over ionix static eliminator end fittings installation is complete third there is no shock hazard with ionix static eliminators since our product does not require electricity to operate fourth previous electronic ionizer customers find ionix units are less costly to replace than ionizer bars finally you do not have to isolate ionix from any metal in its path like you must for ionizers we have had several customers replace their nuclear ionizer with ionix and have saved a substantial amount of money with no diminished performance before you replace your ionizer bar or nuclear ionizer consider a no obligation test of an ionix static eliminator in their place how to solve your static problem most static

plastic cleanup   highly effective  increases the effectiveness of any compressed air line by eliminating the static that holds dust to the surface   safe to use  no nuclear material high voltages or uv radiation to worry about safe to use in class  division  groups c  d explosion proof environments   easy to install at any location  just insert in any air hose and installation is complete   versatile  ionix is used in hand blowoff as well as in automated blowoff lines how we solve your plastic clean up problems plastic materials are superior electrical insulators therefore they tend to easily hold any static electricity charges that accumulate on their surfaces you cant practically prevent static from occurring all you can do is eliminate those charges at the production points they cause you a problem simply trying to blow static dust and debris from plastic without a static eliminator in reality makes your problem worse heres why there is already static on the plastic surface and the debris which is causing them to be electrically attracted to one another compressed air is an electrical insulator so in blowing high volumes of compressed air over your plastic surfaces you are rubbing them with another electrical insulator creating even more static the only reason the debris moves off the surface is youve applied air that has a greater force than the static attraction that dust youve forced off with just find another surface to stick to in reality youve made your static dust issue worse to solve your plastic clean up problem you need to install a static eliminator in your blow off air hose when the air contacts the plastic part and dust it dissipates the static charges holding the debris to the plastic not only does the dust release with less force it and the plastic surface have their static charges dissipated and they wont attract other debris an ionix static eliminator installed on your blow off air line dissipates any surface or static dust on contact how to maintain the ionix static suppression system ionix static eliminators wear out over time with the passage of air through them generally they need to be replaced once a year you remove the old ionix and replace it with a new unit there is no electrical or other connections other than installing ionix in the air hose line which model should i order the ionix model you need depends on the pressure you blow off the surface if you are blowing off the surface at less than  psi order our pl   for air hoses up to  psi if you are blowing off the surface at more than  psi and less than  psi order our hppl for air hoses over  psi and under  psi guarantee our goal is to solve your static problem to your satisfaction ionix is sold with an unconditional  day guarantee you can return your

since  ionix static eliminators for feeder in folders and bindery equipment how ionix works in folder to eliminate static in the feeder since most small format printing is now done on copiers or digital printers the problem of feeder static is more prevalent there is static in the paper from the digital imaging process in folders these paper sheets with static will not easily separate in the pile feeder folder operators experience misfeeds leading to paper jams in the feeder to eliminate static in folder feeders an ionix is installed in the pressure or blast air line going from the feeder pump to the feeder the ionix can be installed at any point in the main air line going to the feeder however install ionix before any lines branch off from the main blast air line since all air going to the feeder needs to be treated by going through the ionix when the compressor air goes through the ionix the feeder mechanism blows out the air between the paper sheets which is acting like an electrical insulator and replaces it with air that acts like an electrical conductor which discharges the static on the interior surfaces of the paper this eliminates the static attraction within the paper in the feeder ionix for folders are sized based upon  the maximum sheet size of the folder and  the inside diameter of the main blower air hose therefore in order to install ionix on a sheet feeding folder you must have this information for folders capable of feeding a sheet up to  mm wide for  mm inside diameter feeder air hose ionix model  for  mm inside diameter feeder air hose ionix

ionix model  for   mm inside diameter feeder air hose ionix model  for  mm inside diameter feeder air hose ionix model  how ionix can eliminate static in folder deliveries many folders experience static in the continuous delivery in addition to static in feeders due to xerographic or digitally imaged paper static in folder deliveries is caused by the combination of xerographic paper and folding friction paper made to be copied or digitally imaged has the ability to hold a static charge that is how the image is transferred from the imaging drum and held to the paper prior to fusing when that same paper is folded friction between the paper and the folding rollers generates static which accumulates on the rollers and folder plates this static charge builds up and then is transferred back to the paper which holds the charge when the paper is ejected into the delivery the static charged folded paper then sticks to other sheets of paper in the delivery in order to eliminate static in the delivery of folders it is necessary to dissipate the static on the rollers and folder plate remember that static eliminators are only effective in eliminating static at the point they are installed static eliminators are not static preventers installing a static eliminator in your feeder will not eliminate static generated on folding rollers ionix eliminates static in folder deliveries by directing ionix treated air onto the folding rollers by piping ionix treated air into the roller guard covers of the folder the roller guards capture and direct the ionix treated air to the folding rollers and base of the folding plates where the ionix air dissipates the static paper is then delivered static free to install the ionix folder delivery system fds you remove your folder roller guards and ship them to ionix where we retrofit them with air bars we also supply an air splitter for your feeder air line which diverts ionix treated air to these air bars the ionix folder delivery system fds requires an ionix unit an air splitter supplied by ionix and one ionix fds air bar installed on at least one roller guard cover on each folder segment or right angle for example if your folder is a straight fold with no right angles you would need  ionix static eliminator  air splitter and  fds air bar installed on one roller guard cover if your folder has  right angle after the folder you would need an additional fds air bar installed on a roller guard cover on the right angle attachment for a total of  fds air bars for an exact quote please contact ionix and advise the number of folder angles the maximum width of paper that can be folded and the inside diameter of the main air pressure hose going to the folder feeder downloadable pdf brochure about ionix folder delivery system static in collators generally if static occurs in collators it is due to copied or digitally imaged paper in the individual bins of a collator which will not separate to dissipate this static and cause the paper to separate an ionix needs to be installed in the blast air line going from the air pump to the bins in the collator identify the pressure air line going from the pump to the collating tower some newer collators do not use an air compressor instead they use turbines or fans to generate separating air since these turbines are built into the collator and there is no air blast pressure line there is no method to introduce ionix into the air feed system static in die cutters laminators and other sheet feeding bindery equipment generally if your machine is a sheet feeding machine with air separating the sheets an ionix can be installed in the feeder air system to eliminate static causing sheet misfeeds however if the static problem in the delivery please contact ionix for proper sizing static in bookbinding machines generally static is bookbinding machines such as saddlebinder perfect binders or case binding occurs in one of two areas if the static is in the gathering pockets static in the signatures cause misfeeds this problem can be remedied by installing the proper ionix in the air separation line blowing into the signature pockets static also causes misfeeding in cover feeder attachments in binding machines this is remedied by installing an ionix in the air line going to the feeder pocket in both cases your should contact ionix for proper sizing the initial ionix installation  day satisfaction guarantee use ionix for  days if your not completely satisfied with your ionix static eliminator you can return it in any condition
