twitter share via email view more sharing options share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close patrick collinson saturday  july   edt last modified on thursday  may   edt john lewis dumps its returns and endofline stock there often at rockbottom prices it’s where  crates of brand new and exdisplay mobile phones – all from the collapse of the phones u chain – were sold off with some handsets going for under £ cars seized by the dvla and stolen goods recovered by the police – but where the owner can’t be traced – often end up there yet the john pye auctions website remains relatively unknown is it a secret ebay where canny buyers can pick up real bargains or the fagend of retail piled high with junk seven years ago when guardian money first featured john pye it was a single warehouse in nottingham handling bankrupt and liquidation stock – and you had to turn up in person and bid but the recession and technology have been kind to the business it is now britain’s biggest firm of commercial auctioneers with  warehouses across the uk including an acre site in the west midlands this is buyer beware with bells on driving its growth has been the string of bankruptcies during the recession that have supplied its stock  and the fact that buyers no longer have to turn up in person bidding instead over the internet at johnpyecouk oddly the website is sometimes busier in china than in britain in march after phones u went belly up and £m of its stock was passing through john pye it got  visits from china and only  from the uk rather more grimly goods that appeared to have been destined for greece “please note a european plug is attached” went under the hammer last week in a warehouse in derby but are they really bargains we checked the final auction prices paid last week at john pye’s west london branch for sealed untouched ipad minis the cheapest went for £ saving £ on the £ price the same model sells for on amazon for some people that will be enough of a saving to warrant giving up any consumer rights – if you buy at auction you can’t return the goods later but oddly we found that some of the ipads had been bid up to as much as £ once vat  and the buyers premium  were added which makes little sense compared with buying at the apple store the site is not just electricals and phones – we found everything from parasols and plant pots to paddington toys and paddling pools over the past year it has also started to sell luxury items – rolex watches appear to be a speciality – and is planning to offload £m in gemstones from one of the uk’s biggest private collections if you are doing up a home we found new sinks taps shower trays readymade curtains sofas and chairs and kitchen appliances at a fraction of high street prices facebook twitter pinterest photograph graeme robertson for the guardian some of the john lewis goods appeared to be real bargains a naples bistro set with chairs and parasol went for £ all in the same set sells in the stores for £ what we can’t tell you is why it was at auction – was it exdisplay or more worryingly returned by a customer unfortunately buyers over the internet won’t know as we discovered when we purchased some john lewis items– and were sorely disappointed see below a remarkable number of dyson vacuum cleaners are going through john pye following a retailer’s tradein deal the cheapest last week went for just £ this week there were heaps of sony cybershot cameras they sold for ££ logik portable dvd players ££ and rack after rack of epson canon and hp inkjet printers some of which went for just p each one thing we particularly noted was that shortly after remarkably similar items to those sold at john pye turned up on gumtree with sellers marketing them as “hardly used” or “unwanted gift” john pye is like an online ikea bargain corner or tk maxx with all its attractions – and frustrations who cares about a barely noticeable scratch if it’s going for a fraction of the usual price but what’s the point paying half price for an electrical item that doesn’t work or a mattress so badly made no one can get a night’s sleep – and where the buyer effectively loses all their consumer rights to complain and return you only need to take a look at reviews of john pye on trustpilotcouk to see the frustrations that some customers have had – although the number of complaints is relatively trivial compared with the m auction lots john pye has sold over the past four years john pye says it has many repeat buyers which proves that it is hardly just selling junk guardian money visited its west london auction rooms on a public viewing day – and to our surprise we were almost the only people there it is housed in a less than glamorous set of warehouses in acton and when we asked for directions at another warehouse nearby no one had even heard of the company the layout is about as far away from a john lewis store as you can get dozens of shiny new mobile phones and ipads still in their packaging and all from phones u were laid out alongside other ipads and iphones with screens so smashed it was difficult to make out anything further along were bathroom products – sinks taps panels etc – that mostly appeared to be new and untouched other items had signs that they were refurbished returned or exdisplay weirdly a black bentley stood in the middle of the warehouse with a starting price of just £ next to a binbag of old clothes facebook twitter pinterest photograph christopher thomond for the guardian was the lack of other viewers a positive sign that the final auction price would be low the warehouse rep told us only one in  bidders actually comes to the public viewing generally they are people who have not bid at a john pye auction before the rest he said take their chances with the pictures online and you do take your chances it is not like ebay – when you look online each item comes with just one photograph and virtually no information bar a oneline description next to that is a blunt warning “all lots are sold as seen with no warranties or guarantees” this is “buyer beware” with bells on delivery is also an issue john pye does not deliver but it can connect buyers with a courier service which charges according to size while a small and light item such as a phone might be worth buying heavy goods only work if you can collect not all the goods are aimed at the general public large amounts of liquidation stock are bagged up into lots that no member of the public would want last week you could buy seven boxes of “best teacher” ribbons they fetched £ box after box of “best teacher” mugs and a pallet load of “high school musical” napkins £ evidently the educational supplies market hasn’t been good for someone john pye is rather like popping into lidl every month or so – you head in for some carrots but somehow walk out with a sunbed cylinder pump and a shoe carousel – and you’re convinced you’ve landed a bargain there is a problem though for all those reading this article it means more people know about the site so prices are likely to rise as more bidders join we don’t know whether to tell you to get your skates on – or that we have saved you from buying junk sorry additional reporting by isabel baylis facebook twitter pinterest stock of digital radios at the john pye auction house new basford nottingham photograph david sillitoe for the guardian buyer beware we were a little giddy here in the guardian money office when we bid for a number of john lewisbranded digital radios – normally selling for £ or £ in the store – on the john pye site and to our delight got them for just £ each they looked in nearmint condition maybe they had been returned by a fussy customer because of a minor scratch what could possibly go wrong unfortunately almost everything we bought eight yes we went a bit mad for a total of £ what we wondered were we going to do with them all they arrived in the office a few days later but after carefully testing each one we knew the answer chuck most of them in the bin the first one just kept saying “insert ipod” and despite lots of button pressing we couldn’t get it to do anything else the second was so bashed up open wires etc we didn’t even try the third looked perfect and promisingly turned on normally but we could not get any sound to come out interestingly in each case the john lewis label had been scratched out it turns out that is something john lewis demands we can understand why but then hurrah the fourth one we opened was in good nick and worked perfectly well we had one bargain at least but sadly that was it – the other four radios either wouldn’t switch on or lit up but no sound would come out our £ wasn’t entirely wasted – we do have at least one working radio – but our disappointment was intense our conclusion was that it’s simply not worth taking the risk of buying online with no right of return unless you know for sure that the item works perhaps we would buy an item if it were in its unopened original packaging such as the ipads we saw and if we obtained a deep discount but for anything else we would only bid if we were able to visit the auction house and test them first we told john pye our results a spokesman says it does not test items before sale and that customers should examine the goods before bidding – although that’s not much help to online bidders “our motto is view bid buy but it’s unusual for so many not to be working we would expect the majority to work did you put the aerial up” thanks for that we did topics online shopping consumer rights consumer affairs retail industry features share on facebook share on twitter share via email share on linkedin

have been using john pyes from about the staff are generally helpful despite being low paidthe stock varies from high quality to cheap and tacky that being said  checking before you buy is essential to avoid losses which are usually unrecoverablemy biggest gripe is that john pyes are not transparent in their use of reserve prices so often times you are only bidding against the john pye reserve price which is set to make them an handsome profit irrespective of whether the item is working or not be afraid be very afraidall bids are online in my experience and i have photographic evidence to substantiate they operate a very rigid and quite high reserve price this may not be a problem if you are buying an item for your own consumptionuse that you have physically rigorously checked for faults however if you are buying blind based upon the description or are buying to sell it will invariably be a disaster because the reserve price that pyes use is minimum of    of the rrp but remember you have to pay  on top of that it really adds up best case scenario example rrp £ you win the item for £ the you must add £ so you end up paying £ for an iten that you can probably purchase on ebay for about £ how much do you think you would make for yourself if you tried to sell that said item on ebay after postage and ebay feesin conclusion if you are purchasing for yourself and trying to save a few pounds  you can definitely do that at pyes if you check items before you bid on them but if you bid blind and are trying to buy to sell be very wary because a refund is like the

needed the best auction site in britain easy bidding techniquethe two reccomendations i am suggesting is for jewellery sales john pye should have all their sites able to post light items to customers like marchingtonit certainly will discourage people from buying without like marchington a royal mail postage optionalso you need a proffessional like me to promote and improve the name and service that john pye supply ie many ordinary people have valuable items to sell but do not know how to do this and it needs to be simple and easy which it can beand finally john pye are an excellent company
