found myself sitting in adam davidsons workshop watching him and michael parks doodling pipe designs onto raw briar  the first step in creating a fine artisanal smoker when i say raw briar mind you i mean a single piece of it onto which they were sketching scratching out and adjusting the prospective shaping of not one but two pipes these two pipes in point of fact each the creation of one of north americas most renowned pipemakers and both shaped from the same block of plateau conceptwise theyre a matched set having begun as mirrorimage sketches however it was important to both adam and michael that theyd each feel free to take the design finish and final presentation of both pipes where ever their inclinations and individual styles as artisans may lead instead of trying compromise either pipe into some manner of davidsonparks hybrid theyd both play to their own strengths and produce the best they could it worked as you can see the michael parks is unmistakably a michael parks  dynamic rugged and scoured with a sandblast of remarkably depth and definition adams likewise is unmistakably adams a danishinfluenced beauty with an easy if quite deep flow a light fine sandblast and one hell of a horn accent and yes though the lengths of stem and shank do differ between the two chamber breadth is matched and depth varies by only a few hundredths of an inch of course michael being an avid outdoorsman and adam being a fellow who is very keen on the revolutionary war period your usual presentation box or stand just wasnt sufficient they wanted something for the presentation that reflected a common ground between both their inclinations and personalities well fortunately enough along with forging glassblowing and briarshaping adam also happens to have good hand for fashioning leather goods thus included with the set is a highquality handstitched leather bag of rustic design for which adam took inspiration from the hunting pouches carried by colonists and frontiersmen of the th century and like good briar the leather itself is wellaged itd been following adam from move to move for fifteen years being the spare half of a hide hed made a blacksmiths apron from as a

flynn and the trump administration’s lobbyist secretsby amy davidson sorkinmay  if ever there was a case illustrating why a history of lobbying and other conflicts might matter it is the case of michael flynn the trump administration’s former nationalsecurity adviserphotograph by jabin botsford  the washington post  gettythis week there have already been reminders of how much the upholding of government ethics relies on access to open information—and of how little donald trump’s administration cares about either some of those reminders have come in the case of michael flynn the president’s first nationalsecurity adviser others have come in the administration’s clumsy attempt to tell walter shaub the head of the office of government ethics not to do his job the administration had said loudly that it would not allow lobbyists to take positions relating to their “particular” lobbyingmarket niche it also said more quietly that it could issue waivers and it had in total silence issued an unknown number of waivers as evidenced by lobbyists popping up without other explanation at various agencies when the obama administration issued such waivers it not only said so but indicated why in writing shaub had asked various agencies to send him by june st a list of those waivers a “data call” of the sort that he is explicitly authorized to make the white house doesn’t seem to have liked thatthe president’s designated messenger was mick mulvaney the head of the office of management and budget mulvaney in a letter to shaub that the times obtained through the freedom of information act a reminder that openness takes work said that agencies had asked the white house about the data call and that he was giving them some “guidance” his instructions amounted to letting the agencies know that white house lawyers might have a problem with them giving out information and a “request” to shaub that he “stay the data call”—that is that he just stop asking the office of legal counsel at the justice department needed to figure out the “potential legal questions” that the request raised mulvaney wrote but there are no legal questions—other than perhaps those that might arise from whatever the waivers revealedshaub said no to mulvaney’s request in a tenpage reply he said that he did not do so lightly but because he did not know how to comply in a way that would not be a renunciation of his office’s history and its mandate he included footnotes and citations regarding his legal authority for mulvaney’s “edification” mulvaney had complained about the “uniqueness” of shaub’s data call but shaub made it clear that it was mulvaney’s action that was highly unusualand if ever there were a case illustrating why a history of lobbying and other conflicts—factors that the waivers are meant to at least acknowledge—might matter it is the case of michael flynn he has been implicated in the investigation into russia’s role in the  election and its possible connections to the trump campaign but there are also questions regarding money that his firm took from turkish interests as an unacknowledged lobbyist for recep tayyip erdoğan’s regime flynn  registered as a foreign lobbyist only after the fact according to another report this week flynn withheld information about his russian contacts from the obama administration in which he had served as the head of the defense intelligence agency before being pushed out when his security clearances were being renewed flynn is reportedly planning to invoke the fifth amendment when he is called to testify which is his right and one of the few legitimate and reasonable uses of silence in this story but his former colleagues in the administration should not suppose that his potential invocation of the fifth magically extends to their offices in terms of a refusal to for example produce documents that congress or investigators might require and some of those documents may be significant among the most disturbing flynn stories have been those indicating that the trump transition team knew about flynn’s conflicts—and even that he was under federal investigation—but signed him up anyway that is not just stonewalling it is incompetence it is of a piece with the entire trump operation—one can’t talk about the lack of disclosure without noting that the public still hasn’t seen the president’s tax returns for that matter the congressional republicans tried to start their spree of legislating with the support of a president of the same party by sidelining its ethical overseerbut there is something distinctly dangerous about a government that thinks that what it can hide and lie about does not for practical purposes exist—that if no one knows about it it’s not a problem even internally people in government even under the best administrations tend to care less about things that are bad if they think that no one will ever find out about them there is an impulse to hide rather than to fix but the trump administration seems to have stopped caring at all the alarming possibility is that the white house doesn’t just think that when something is out of sight it is out of the public’s mind but that it then vanishes from the minds of the president and his aides as wellthe white house’s evident indifference raises the question of whether prior to shaub’s inquiry anyone there was even keeping track of how many waivers were being granted and where and at what cost or if they were just left out for the taking like officeparty doughnuts it is at any rate a good guess that the shaubmulvaney conflict prefigures any number of fights to come some will end up in court and may have to be resolved by a reëxamination by the supreme court of the meaning of executive privilegenondisclosure can also involve a false assertion that there is no information to disclose the washington post reported that president trump asked the heads of intelligence agencies to publicly deny that there was anything to the russian investigation they apparently demurred by his own admission trump fired james comey because that inquiry annoyed him and then there are the administration’s arguments in support of its travel ban that the courts should allow the white house to pretend that the ban has nothing to do with muslims but this kind of thing never works for long or at least it shouldn’t in a democracytrump and his circle may prefer a different model on monday wilbur ross the secretary of commerce appeared on cnbc discussing the president’s visit to saudi arabia he found it “fascinating” that there was

out of   reviews publishers description▼▲ in this classic work the author joins the dots between three of the most powerful words in language life judgment and inheritance unless we understand all three of these words we will find ourselves at a disadvantage in trying to pay the cost of discipleship we will find ourselves unable to achieve the goal of godly passion which is intimacy the journey from the new birth to the new jerusalem is called life it is our life that determines our rank in the eternal city you will never look at life in the same way again after reading this book you will discover the role that intimacy plays in the grand scheme of things and find practical ways to achieve it judgment is not a word to be feared one of the wisest things we can do is look at the manner in which god will assess our lives our purpose is to discover the things that please him here that we may better enjoy him there the goal is to enter fully into the inheritance that god has destined for us the invitation is both deeply inspirational and profoundly insightful it is packed with new thoughts that move the reader both spiritually and metaphorically from life through judgment to the wedding feast of the lamb michael davidson is a church elder worship leader and bible teacher his ministry passion is to see christians reach their destiny in christ he and his wife irene have two
