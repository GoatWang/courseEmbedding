with leather bag adam davidson and michael parks two pipe set with leather bag product number  some months ago i found myself sitting in adam davidsons workshop watching him and michael parks doodling pipe designs onto raw briar  the first step in creating a fine artisanal smoker when i say raw briar mind you i mean a single piece of it onto which they were sketching scratching out and adjusting the prospective shaping of not one but two pipes these two pipes in point of fact each the creation of one of north americas most renowned pipemakers and both shaped from the same block of plateau conceptwise theyre a matched set having begun as mirrorimage sketches however it was important to both adam and michael that theyd each feel free to take the design finish and final presentation of both pipes where ever their inclinations and individual styles as artisans may lead instead of trying compromise either pipe into some manner of davidsonparks hybrid theyd both play to their own strengths and produce the best they could it worked as you can see the michael parks is unmistakably a michael parks  dynamic rugged and scoured with a sandblast of remarkably depth and definition adams likewise is unmistakably adams a danishinfluenced beauty with an easy if quite deep flow a light fine sandblast and one hell of a horn accent and yes though the lengths of stem and shank do differ between the two chamber breadth is matched and depth varies by only a few hundredths of an inch of course michael being an avid outdoorsman and adam being a fellow who is very keen on the revolutionary war period your usual presentation box or stand just wasnt sufficient they wanted something for the presentation that reflected a common ground between both their inclinations and personalities well fortunately enough along with forging glassblowing and briarshaping adam also happens to have good hand for fashioning leather goods thus included with the set is a highquality handstitched leather bag of rustic design for which adam took inspiration from the hunting pouches carried by colonists and frontiersmen of the th century and like good briar the leather itself is wellaged itd been following adam from move to move for fifteen years being the spare half of a hide hed made a blacksmiths apron from as a teenager  eric n squires video loading the player  Â  your

inlink your subscriptionamy davidson sorkinmichael flynn and the trump administrationâs lobbyist secretsby amy davidson sorkinmay  if ever there was a case illustrating why a history of lobbying and other conflicts might matter it is the case of michael flynn the trump administrationâs former nationalsecurity adviserphotograph by jabin botsford  the washington post  gettythis week there have already been reminders of how much the upholding of government ethics relies on access to open informationâand of how little donald trumpâs administration cares about either some of those reminders have come in the case of michael flynn the presidentâs first nationalsecurity adviser others have come in the administrationâs clumsy attempt to tell walterÂ shaub the head of the office of government ethics not to do his job the administration had said loudly that it would not allow lobbyists to take positions relating to their âparticularâ lobbyingmarket niche it also said more quietly that it could issue waivers and it had in total silence issued an unknown number of waivers as evidenced by lobbyists popping up without other explanation at various agencies when the obama administration issued such waivers it not only said so but indicated why in writing shaub had asked various agencies to send him by june st a list of those waivers a âdata callâ of the sort that he is explicitly authorized to make the white house doesnât seem to have liked thatthe presidentâs designated messenger was mick mulvaney the head of the office of management and budget mulvaney in a letter to shaub that the times obtained through the freedom of information act a reminder that openness takes work said that agencies had asked the white house about the data call and that he was giving them some âguidanceâ his instructions amounted to letting the agencies know thatÂ white house lawyers might have a problem with them giving out information and a ârequestâ to shaub that he âstay the data callââthat is that he just stop asking the office of legal counsel at the justice department needed to figure out the âpotential legal questionsâ that the request raised mulvaney wrote but there are no legal questionsâother than perhaps those that might arise from whatever the waivers revealedshaub said no to mulvaneyâs request in a tenpage reply he said that he did not do so lightly but because he did not know how to comply in a way that would not be a renunciation of his officeâs history and its mandate he included footnotes and citations regarding his legal authority for mulvaneyâs âedificationâ mulvaney had complained about the âuniquenessâ of shaubâs data call but shaub made it clear that it was mulvaneyâs action that was highly unusualand if ever there wereÂ a case illustrating why a history of lobbying and other conflictsâfactors that the waivers are meant to at least acknowledgeâmight matter it is the case of michael flynn he has been implicated in the investigation into russiaâs role in the  election and its possible connections to the trump campaign but there are also questions regarding money that his firm took from turkish interests as an unacknowledged lobbyist for recep tayyip erdoÄanâs regime flynn Â registered as a foreign lobbyist only after the fact according to another report this week flynn withheld information about his russian contacts from the obama administration in which he had served as the head of the defense intelligence agency before being pushed out when his security clearances were being renewed flynn is reportedly planning to invoke the fifth amendment when he is called to testify which is his right and one of the few legitimate and reasonable uses of silence in this story but his former colleagues in the administration should not suppose that his potential invocation of the fifth magically extends to their offices in terms of a refusal to for example produce documents that congress or investigators might require and some of those documents may be significant among the most disturbing flynn stories have been those indicating that the trump transition team knew about flynnâs conflictsâand even that he was under federal investigationâbut signed him up anyway that is not just stonewalling it is incompetence it is of a piece with the entire trump operationâone canât talk about the lack of disclosure without noting that the public still hasnât seen the presidentâs tax returns for that matter the congressional republicans tried to start their spree of legislating with the support of a president of the same party by sidelining its ethical overseerbut there is something distinctly dangerous about a government that thinks that what it can hide and lie about does not for practical purposes existâthat if no one knows about it itâs not a problem even internallyÂ people in government even under the best administrations tend to care less about things that are bad if they think that no one will ever find outÂ about them there is an impulse to hide rather than to fix but the trump administration seems to have stopped caring at all the alarming possibility is that the white house doesnât just think that when something is out of sight it is out of the publicâs mind but that it then vanishes from the minds of the president and his aides as wellthe white houseâs evident indifference raises the question of whether prior to shaubâs inquiry anyone there was even keeping track of how many waivers were being granted and where and at what cost or if they were just left out for the taking like officeparty doughnuts it is at any rate a good guess that the shaubmulvaney conflict prefigures any number of fights to come some will end up in court and may have to be resolved by a reÃ«xamination by the supreme court of the meaning of executive privilegenondisclosure can also involve a false assertion that there is no information to disclose the washington post reported that president trump asked the heads of intelligence agencies to publicly deny that there was anything to the russian investigation they apparently demurred by his own admission trump fired james comey because that inquiry annoyed him and then there are the administrationâs arguments in support of its travel ban that the courts should allow the white house to pretend that the ban has nothing to do with muslims but this kind of thing never works for long or at least it shouldnât in a democracytrump and his circle may prefer a different model on monday wilbur ross the secretary of commerce appeared on cnbc discussing the presidentâs visit to saudi arabia he found it âfascinatingâ that there was not âa single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were thereâ so much more pleasant than here and really blind nonsense saudi arabia is a repressive regime that silences dissent with a reputation for corruption that has fuelled discontent and provided fodder for extremists secrets come out in one form or the other becky quick the Â interviewer suggested as much to ross he agreed that âin theoryâ fear may have been a factor âbut boy there was certainly no sign of itâ he said âthe mood was genuinely goodâ perhaps the mood was helped by the giant portraits of trump projected on

author joins the dots between three of the most powerful words in language life judgment and inheritance unless we understand all three of these words we will find ourselves at a disadvantage in trying to pay the cost of discipleship we will find ourselves unable to achieve the goal of godly passion which is intimacy the journey from the new birth to the new jerusalem is called life it is our life that determines our rank in the eternal city you will never look at life in the same way again after reading this book you will discover the role that intimacy plays in the grand scheme of things and find practical ways to achieve it judgment is not a word to be feared one of the wisest things we can do is look at the manner in which god will assess our lives our purpose is to discover the things that please him here that we may better enjoy him there the goal is to enter fully into the inheritance that god has destined for us the invitation is both deeply inspirational and profoundly insightful it is packed with new thoughts that move the reader both spiritually and metaphorically from life through judgment to the wedding feast of the lamb michael davidson is a church elder
