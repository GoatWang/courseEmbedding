opened four retail dry goods stores including the original macys store in downtown haverhill massachusetts established in  to serve the mill industry employees of the area they all failed but he learned from his mistakes macy moved to new york city in  and established a new store named r h macy  co on sixth avenue between th and th streets which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time on the companys first day of business on october   sales totaled us equal to  today from the beginning macys logo has included a star which comes from a tattoo that macy got as a teenager when he worked on a nantucket whaling ship the emily morgan as the business grew macys expanded into neighboring buildings opening more and more departments and used publicity devices such as a store santa claus themed exhibits and illuminated window displays to draw in customers– it also offered a money back guarantee although it accepted only cash into the s the store also produced its own madetomeasure clothing for both men and women assembled in an onsite factory in  macy took on two partners robert m valentine – a nephew and abiel t la forge – of wisconsin who was the husband of a cousin macy died in  from inflammatory kidney disease then known as brights disease la forge died the following year and valentine died in  ownership of the company remained in the macy family until  when the company now called r h macy  co was acquired by isidor straus and his brother nathan straus who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the macys store in  the flagship store moved uptown to herald square at th street and broadway so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from th street to th street although the herald square store initially consisted of just one building it expanded through new construction eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by seventh avenue on the west broadway on the east th street on the south and th street on the north with the exception of a small preexisting building on the corner of th street and seventh avenue and another on the corner of th street and broadway this latter story building was purchased by robert h smith in  for  equivalent to  million in  – an incredible sum at the time – with the idea of getting in the way of macys becoming the largest store in the world it is largely supposed that smith who was a neighbor of the macys store on th street was acting on behalf of siegelcooper which had built what they thought was the worlds largest store on sixth avenue in  macys ignored the tactic and simply built around the building which now carries macys shopping bag sign by lease arrangement in  isidor straus died in the sinking of the titanic at the age of  with his wife ida the original broadway store was designed by architects de lemos  cordes was built in – by the fuller company and has a palladian facade but has been updated in many details there were further additions to the west in  and  and the seventh avenue building in  all designed by architect robert d kohn the newer buildings were increasingly art deco in style in  macys began the first full renovation of the iconic herald square flagship store at a reported cost of us studio v architecture a new yorkbased firm was the overall master plan architect of the project studio vs fresh design of the department store raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration the building was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in  the store has several wooden escalators still in operation expansion and bankruptcyedit the problem of preexisting buildings also presented itself when macys built a store on queens boulevard in elmhurst in the new york city borough of queens this resulted in a unique round department store on  percent of the lot with a small privately owned house on the corner macys no longer fully occupies this building which now contains the queens place mall with macys furniture gallery as a tenant instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby queens center this relocation was the result of macys merger with federated department stores the parent company of abraham  straus in  which led to the latter being absorbed by the former

square in  the same location in  entrance detail macys was founded by rowland hussey macy who between  and  opened four retail dry goods stores including the original macys store in downtown haverhill massachusetts established in  to serve the mill industry employees of the area they all failed but he learned from his mistakes macy moved to new york city in  and established a new store named r h macy  co on sixth avenue between th and th streets which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time on the companys first day of business on october   sales totaled us equal to  today from the beginning macys logo has included a star which comes from a tattoo that macy got as a teenager when he worked on a nantucket whaling ship the emily morgan as the business grew macys expanded into neighboring buildings opening more and more departments and used publicity devices such as a store santa claus themed exhibits and illuminated window displays to draw in customers– it also offered a money back guarantee although it accepted only cash into the s the store also produced its own madetomeasure clothing for both men and women assembled in an onsite factory in  macy took on two partners robert m valentine – a nephew and abiel t la forge – of wisconsin who was the husband of a cousin macy died in  from inflammatory kidney disease then known as brights disease la forge died the following year and valentine died in  ownership of the company remained in the macy family until  when the company now called r h macy  co was acquired by isidor straus and his brother nathan straus who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the macys store in  the flagship store moved uptown to herald square at th street and broadway so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from th street to th street although the herald square store initially consisted of just one building it expanded through new construction eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by seventh avenue on the west broadway on the east th street on the south and th street on the north with the exception of a small preexisting building on the corner of th street and seventh avenue and another on the corner of th street and broadway this latter story building was purchased by robert h smith in  for  equivalent to  million in  – an incredible sum at the time – with the idea of getting in the way of macys becoming the largest store in the world it is largely supposed that smith who was a neighbor of the macys store on th street was acting on behalf of siegelcooper which had built what they thought was the worlds largest store on sixth avenue in  macys ignored the tactic and simply built around the building which now carries macys shopping bag sign by lease arrangement in  isidor straus died in the sinking of the titanic at the age of  with his wife ida the original broadway store was designed by architects de lemos  cordes was built in – by the fuller company and has a palladian facade but has been updated in many details there were further additions to the west in  and  and the seventh avenue building in  all designed by architect robert d kohn the newer buildings were increasingly art deco in style in  macys began the first full renovation of the iconic herald square flagship store at a reported cost of us studio v architecture a new yorkbased firm was the overall master plan architect of the project studio vs fresh design of the department store raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration the building was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in  the store has several wooden escalators still in operation expansion and bankruptcyedit the problem of preexisting buildings also presented itself when macys built a store on queens boulevard in elmhurst in the new york city borough of queens this resulted in a unique round department store on  percent of the lot with a small privately owned house on the corner macys no longer fully occupies this building which now contains the queens place mall with macys furniture gallery as a tenant instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby queens center this relocation was the result of macys merger with federated department stores the parent company of abraham  straus in  which led to the latter being absorbed by the former more distant acquisitions included lasalle  koch toledo  davisonpaxonstokes atlanta  l bamberger  co newark  oconnor moffat  company san francisco  and john taylor dry goods co kansas city  oconnor moffat was renamed macys san francisco in  later becoming macys california and john

square macys in herald square in  the same location in  entrance detail macys was founded by rowland hussey macy who between  and  opened four retail dry goods stores including the original macys store in downtown haverhill massachusetts established in  to serve the mill industry employees of the area they all failed but he learned from his mistakes macy moved to new york city in  and established a new store named r h macy  co on sixth avenue between th and th streets which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time on the companys first day of business on october   sales totaled us equal to  today from the beginning macys logo has included a star which comes from a tattoo that macy got as a teenager when he worked on a nantucket whaling ship the emily morgan as the business grew macys expanded into neighboring buildings opening more and more departments and used publicity devices such as a store santa claus themed exhibits and illuminated window displays to draw in customers– it also offered a money back guarantee although it accepted only cash into the s the store also produced its own madetomeasure clothing for both men and women assembled in an onsite factory in  macy took on two partners robert m valentine – a nephew and abiel t la forge – of wisconsin who was the husband of a cousin macy died in  from inflammatory kidney disease then known as brights disease la forge died the following year and valentine died in  ownership of the company remained in the macy family until  when the company now called r h macy  co was acquired by isidor straus and his brother nathan straus who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the macys store in  the flagship store moved uptown to herald square at th street and broadway so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from th street to th street although the herald square store initially consisted of just one building it expanded through new construction eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by seventh avenue on the west broadway on the east th street on the south and th street on the north with the exception of a small preexisting building on the corner of th street and seventh avenue and another on the corner of th street and broadway this latter story building was purchased by robert h smith in  for  equivalent to  million in  – an incredible sum at the time – with the idea of getting in the way of macys becoming the largest store in the world it is largely supposed that smith who was a neighbor of the macys store on th street was acting on behalf of siegelcooper which had built what they thought was the worlds largest store on sixth avenue in  macys ignored the tactic and simply built around the building which now carries macys shopping bag sign by lease arrangement in  isidor straus died in the sinking of the titanic at the age of  with his wife

additions to the west in  and  and the seventh avenue building in  all designed by architect robert d kohn the newer buildings were increasingly art deco in style in  macys began the first full renovation of the iconic herald square flagship store at a reported cost of us studio v architecture a new yorkbased firm was the overall master plan architect of the project studio vs fresh design of the department store raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration the building was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in  the store has several wooden escalators still in operation expansion and bankruptcyedit the problem of preexisting buildings also presented itself when macys built a store on queens boulevard in elmhurst in the new york city borough of queens this resulted in a unique round department store on  percent of the lot with a small privately owned house on the corner macys no longer fully occupies this building which now contains the queens place mall with macys furniture gallery as a tenant instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby queens center this relocation was the result of macys merger with federated department stores the parent company of abraham  straus in  which led to the latter being absorbed by the former more distant acquisitions included lasalle  koch

of boston with bloomingdale brothers of new york joining the next year founded by xavier warren federated was the successor to the lazarus operation begun in columbus in  in the mids a modern merchandising standard was set when fred lazarus jr arranged garments in groups of a single size with a range of style color and price in that size basing the technique upon observations made in paris lazarus also convinced president franklin d roosevelt that changing the thanksgiving holiday from the last thursday of november to the fourth thursday extending the christmas shopping season would benefit the nations business an act of congress perpetuated the arrangement in  after this date black friday became a nationwide sensation and the most profitable day for federated various lazarus family members also held key positions on federateds board and within its various divisions—namely foleys filenes lazarus and shillitos robert lazarus jr was the only family member still with an official role at federated until his death in  serving as assistant to ron klein then chairman and ceo of the richslazarusgoldsmiths operating unit federateds corporate offices were relocated to

original headquarters of federatedmacys inc to support its huge retail operations federated centralized its backoffice functions into several large divisions covering financial services marketing merchandising logistics and data processing systems other retailers branded credit cards are usually issued and serviced by a thirdparty bank federated was so huge that it ran its own private bank fds bank which for many years issued and maintained the majority of its own consumer credit card portfolio with a portion at one time owned by general electric credit corporation an arrangement inherited from when rh macy  company sold their credit portfolio in an attempt to prevent filing for bankruptcy in  federated finalized an arrangement with citigroup to sell its consumer credit portfolio reissuing its cards under the federatedcitigroup alliance name department stores national bank dsnb and allowing federated to continue servicing the credit accounts from its financial administrative and credit services group macys credit and customer services in  federated—now under the control of robert campeau—went bankrupt after its hostile takeover of allied stores it emerged from bankruptcy after the ouster of campeau in  as a new public company federated then took over macys in  while that company was still emerging from its own bankruptcy in  federated entered ecommerce late in  fds bank was one of the last credit card banks to begin to allow its cardholders to access account information online around  the department store chain sterns a division of federated ceased operations in  and most of its stores became macys stores in  federated changed the nameplates of all their nonmacys stores except bloomingdales to include the macys name the rebranding process was referred internally to as project hyphen under the plan seattlebased the bon marché became bonmacys goldsmiths in tennessee became goldsmithsmacys lazarus burdines and richs also added macys to their name a year later the original hyphenated names were dropped in favor of just macys a rebranding process referred internally to as project star federated settled an sec investigation for  million equivalent to  million in  in  due to unethical debtcollection practices federated routinely forced credit card holdersdebtors to sign an agreement that legally bound them to repay their outstanding balances instead of having the unsecured debt discharge via the filing of bankruptcy federated failed to file reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts as a result the changes in the agreements were not legally binding may department stores acquisitionedit the former federated department stores logo in use until  on july   federated department stores announced that it would acquire may department stores company for  billion equivalent to  billion in  in cash and stock also part of the buyout was the bridal and formal unit of may consisting of davids bridal and after hours formalwear federated would also assume  billion equivalent to  billion in  of mays debt bringing total consideration to  billion equivalent to  billion in  the deal would create the nations largest department store chain with over  stores and  billion equivalent to  billion in  in annual sales to help finance the deal federated agreed to sell its combined proprietary credit card business but still administered by facs group a subsidiary of federated to citigroup the merger was completed on august   after an assurance agreement was reached with the state attorneys general of new york california massachusetts maryland and pennsylvania as a result of the merger federated also in the process reacquired two of their former department store chains foleys  filenes which federated originally sold to may company putting them back under the federated department stores corporate umbrella for the first time since  federated announced plans to sell  store locations in  having pledged in its settlement to sell most of them as viable businesses with preference being given to a group of thirteen competitors this number could fluctuate pursuant to federateds negotiations with various mall landlords and its final decision regarding using former macy locations for its luxury bloomingdales operation on january   federated announced its plans to divest may companys lord  taylor division  stores in  states by the end of  after utilizing prime and conflicting real estate by closing and converting several locations on june   macys announced that nrdc equity partners llc would purchase lord  taylor for us billion equivalent to  billion in  and completed the sale in october  on september   may company division stores famousbarr filenes foleys kaufmanns hechts the jones store l s ayres marshall fields meier  frank robinsonsmay and strawbridges brands ceased to exist as federated replaced most of them with the macys masthead and a few converting to the bloomingdales brand the conversion of marshall fields in chicago has been particularly criticized with many customers boycotting its historic state street flagship store the chicago tribune continues to report on the poor reception of macys in chicago pittsburgh customers strongly resisted the change from kauffmans most due to the local parade that the store had run for years the loss of local mainstays such as famousbarr in st louis and filenes in boston were also met with criticism but they were not nearly as vocal as marshall fieldscitation needed one of the consequences of this rebranding is that several malls have two macys stores in downtown boston federated liquidated an acquired filenes because it already had a macys formerly a jordan marsh across the street the two stores have a combined floorspace of more than  square feet  m more than twothirds the size of macys new york city flagship store on november   the bridal and formal unit was sold davids bridal and priscilla of boston were sold to leonard green  partners after hours formalwear was sold to mens wearhouse operations as macys incedit on february   federated announced that its board of directors would ask shareholders to change the companys name to macys group inc by march  the company revised its plans for the new name opting to eventually become macys inc federated shareholders approved the revised proposal during the companys annual meeting on may   the company was previously known as federated retail holdings inc the name took effect on june   reasoning for the proposed name change according to terry lundgren federateds chairman president and chief executive officer — hinges on the largescale conversions throughout the company toward the macys nameplate today we are a branddriven company focused on macys and bloomingdales not a federation of department stores lundgren said in the companys press release heralding the proposed name upon the change to macys inc federateds stock ticker symbol on the new york stock exchange changed from fd to m making the new macys inc one of a handful of singleletter ticker symbol companies in april  moodys investors service said that it may downgrade macys inc bonds to just above junk status that same month fitch ratings downgraded their ratings to bbb from bbb noting a deterioration in the companys operating and credit metrics a rating of bbb is one notch above junk status the

lower expenses as part of major restructuring cincinnatibased macys inc said the work force reduction includes positions in offices stores and other locations the cuts will include some unfilled jobs reducing our workforce is an unfortunate outcome of the current economic environment and i am frustrated that so many of our people will be unable to move forward with us as we proceed into a very exciting future for macy’s and bloomingdales said terry j lundgren chairman president and chief executive officer  macys also got rid of its division structure and integrated its functions into one organization macys central buying merchandise planning stores senior management and marketing functions merged to its new york city corporate office formerly macys east corporaterelated business functions such as finance and human resources will be primarily in cincinnati to buy with local consumers in mind macys developed a concept called my macys in which the buyers and planners all look at

but the big question is how running a business is like running a marathon you’ve made it through the starting gun and established your pace you’ve developed a business plan found and managed initial startup funding and you’re producing your line forging relationships with writers editors and buyers you’ve built your ecommerce website and your social media presence and you’re getting your product into your target customer’s hands not there yet visit the business of fashion’s excellent series on basics expanding your distribution is a natural step and working with a major retailer like macy’s can be a tremendous part of achieving that goal but to be successful in taking this major step there are some key things you’ll need to do find out more by reviewing our frequently asked questions how do i approach a major retailer about doing business with my company understand the retailer you’re targeting what’s their business model who’s the customer what are their price points and what value do they offer their customer have an understanding of the range of business models including pricing structure staffing requirements and marketing needs you’ve got to be able to describe how your line fits with their business model and how your products enhance their offering and their relationship with the customer we see a lot of vendors who lack basic knowledge about the business of retail which doesn’t set them up for success a retailer wants to understand the opportunity a vendor is proposing does your product bring in a new customer maximize an existing business or capitalize on a new category in turn your ability to speak to your demand and opportunity in quantifiable terms substantiated through sales history and market data is necessary how do i position my company the first step is to understand your competition a major pitfall for emerging vendors is a lack of knowledge about the competition who are you competing against what are their strengths and weaknesses what is your unique advantage where are your competitors in the retailer you’re targeting make sure you know their distribution how they’re merchandised and what value your brand brings to the table for the retailer and the customer what’s the value equation to be successful in the retail environment you must be able to articulate the value and pricing equation and have a fully intelligent and realistic conversation about what the customer is willing to pay know this will vary from retailer to retailer and be prepared to talk about where your product falls on the value price spectrum and why it makes sense carefully target the retailers that are the best fit for your product line and your value equation in this industry you have to prove to the customer every day that you deserve her dollar—consistently every day with every touchpoint remember who your customer is and who your retail partners are what will a retailer want to know beyond my product line and value equation to scale up to working with a major retailer you’ve got to be able to show the demand for your product a presence in smaller retailers and a solid ecommerce presence in your own right will help demonstrate your financial backing and your growth—both key elements of successfully growing your business through a major retailer partnership what concerns will a major retailer have in working with a growing company like mine sustainable growth is key filling that first big order from a major retailer can be daunting and many emerging vendors find they have to make a big stretch in order to fulfill it it’s great to hit that “i’ve made it” point and get that order out the door but it’s critical to understand that’s not the pinnacle the real test is how you handle the second order and the third and how you maintain that ability to fill orders over time make sure your growth is sustainable and that you’ve got not only an indepth understanding of what’s required to succeed in your targeted area of business but also shore up the resources you’ll need to compete how do i build a relationship with macy’s through our years of working with a wide variety of retail vendors macy’s has found that our strongest vendor relationships are true partnerships with ongoing collaboration and strong constant communication vendor relationships work best when everyone is equally invested in the opportunity and committed to working through challenges as they arise weve found this to be true regardless of the size of the business understanding and respect for one another and for the respective businesses is key and when that doesnt exist the relationship is challenging to maintain we look for strong interpersonal communications skills in our vendors we focus on being in tune with our customers and expect them to do the same we also want our vendors to work closely with their merchant partners to understand the market and the customer with the rollout and success of the my macy’s strategy this is more important than ever collaboration is a critical success factor as is open and honest communication everyone involved needs to be authentic and to really believe in their idea and their product youve got to have a compelling story and product offering – an assortment not a single product – to engage the merchants and build interest in your line the first impression is critical – making a strong showing and then delivering on the initial package perhaps the greatest misconception emerging vendors have coming into a major retailer is that its easy to become a vendor and that all they need to do is make a good product and ship it and the retailer will do the rest most vendors are successful when they can show that demand exists for their product via an online presence or a presence in smaller retailers its also necessary to have the resources both people and financial in place to support marketing and sales efforts in the store to be successful you must have the resources to support that great idea and product offering day in and day out aligned with the aforementioned the vendor must be flexible and have the ability to adapt to everevolving merchandise strategies which further highlights the need for strong interpersonal skills that allow the vendor to foster strong merchant relationships the best advice we can give potential vendors is to do your homework – learn as much as you can about the industry your potential partners your competition visit stores stay in touch with your target customer keep a pulse on their needs be a good listener feedback is key – be as willing to listen as you are to talk macy’s shares our insights with our vendors every day and its important that everyone involved is fully engaged being open to that feedback and to collaboration is an important part of being a successful macy’s vendor most emerging vendors have a period of ramping up as they come into a major retailer relationship you may not have every piece of the puzzle in place at the outset – but you must have the foundation the rest is where the partnership and relationship building comes in how does macy’s work with vendors once a potential vendor has been vetted through our process and identified as a good potential vendor the next step is to place the product line in test doors in our  store network using the my macy’s strategy of localizing the merchandise mix to fit the customer the trifecta of the minority merchandising and vendor development team the merchant team and the field organization work together to determine where the macy’s customer is most appropriate based on the product offering the merchant team makes the offering available to planners in the identified test markets the planners make the ultimate determination for each store based on their market their customer and their merchandise mix once the merchandise mix and test doors are determined we place the first order for many vendors filling the first order is a major test but the real test is what happens next – how you fill the second order and sustaining the ability to fill orders over time its why having the foundation in place is so important to an ongoing successful partnership building and maintaining demand for your product is an ongoing effort and requires focus communication and collaboration in this industry you have to prove to the customer every day that you deserve her dollar you must prove your worth to her consistently the pendulum shift in demand isnt automatic – it has to be built and when the demand is built it has to be met through consistent timely delivery of orders on an ongoing basis getting our vendors through these initial hurdles is the reason we created the workshop at macy’s all of these elements and how to navigate them successfully are part of the workshop at macy’s curriculum how can i build the knowledge i need all these topics and much more are covered in the workshop a free four and a half day training course

historyedit see also macys herald square macys in herald square in  the same location in  entrance detail macys was founded by rowland hussey macy who between  and  opened four retail dry goods stores including the original macys store in downtown haverhill massachusetts established in  to serve the mill industry employees of the area they all failed but he learned from his mistakes macy moved to new york city in  and established a new store named r h macy  co on sixth avenue between th and th streets which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time on the companys first day of business on october   sales totaled us equal to  today from the beginning macys logo has included a star which comes from a tattoo that macy got as a teenager when he worked on a nantucket whaling ship the emily morgan as the business grew macys expanded into neighboring buildings opening more and more departments and used publicity devices such as a store santa claus themed exhibits and illuminated window displays to draw in customers– it also offered a money back guarantee although it accepted only cash into the s the store also produced its own madetomeasure clothing for both men and women assembled in an onsite factory in  macy took on two partners robert m valentine – a nephew and abiel t la forge – of wisconsin who was the husband of a cousin macy died in  from inflammatory kidney disease then known as brights disease la forge died the following year and valentine died in  ownership of the company remained in the macy family until  when the company now called r h macy  co was acquired by isidor straus and his brother nathan straus who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the macys store in  the flagship store moved uptown to herald square at th street and broadway so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from th street to th street although the herald square store initially consisted of just one building it expanded through new construction eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by seventh avenue on the west broadway on the east th street on the south and th street on the north with the exception of a small preexisting building on the corner of th street and seventh avenue and another on the corner of th street and broadway this latter story building was purchased by robert h smith in  for  equivalent to  million in  – an incredible sum at the time – with the idea of getting in the way of macys becoming the largest store in the world it is largely supposed that smith who was a neighbor of the macys store on th street was acting on behalf of siegelcooper which had built what they thought was the worlds largest store on sixth avenue in  macys ignored the tactic and simply built around the building which now carries macys shopping bag sign by lease arrangement in  isidor straus died in the sinking of the titanic at the age of  with his wife ida the original broadway store was designed by architects de lemos  cordes was built in – by the fuller company and has a palladian facade but has been updated in many details there were further additions to the west in  and  and the seventh avenue building in  all designed by architect robert d kohn the newer buildings were increasingly art deco in style in  macys began the first full renovation of the iconic herald square flagship store at a reported cost of us studio v architecture a new yorkbased firm was the overall master plan architect of the project studio vs fresh design of the department store raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration the building was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in  the store has several wooden escalators still in operation expansion and bankruptcyedit the problem of preexisting buildings also presented itself when macys built a store on queens boulevard in elmhurst in the new york city borough of queens this resulted in a unique round department store on  percent of the lot with a small privately owned house on the corner macys no longer fully occupies this building which now contains the queens place mall with macys furniture gallery as a tenant instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby queens center this relocation was the result of macys merger with federated department stores the parent company of abraham  straus in  which led to the latter being absorbed by the former more distant

continental united states hawaii puerto rico and guam including the herald square flagship location in midtown manhattan new york city macys has conducted the annual macys thanksgiving day parade in new york city since  and has sponsored the citys annual fourth of july fireworks display since  macys herald square is one of the largest department stores in the world the flagship store covers almost an entire new york city block features about  million square feet of retail space includes additional space for offices and storage and serves as the endpoint for macys annual thanksgiving day

 external links historyedit early historyedit see also macys herald square macys in herald square in  the same location in  entrance detail macys was founded by rowland hussey macy who between  and  opened four retail dry goods stores including the original macys store in downtown haverhill massachusetts established in  to serve the mill industry employees of the area they all failed but he learned from his mistakes macy moved to new york city in  and established a new store named r h macy  co on sixth avenue between th and th streets which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time on the companys first day of business on october   sales totaled us equal to  today from the beginning macys logo has included a star which comes from a tattoo that macy got as a teenager when he worked on a nantucket whaling ship the emily morgan as the business grew macys expanded into neighboring buildings opening more and more departments and used publicity devices such as a store santa claus themed exhibits and illuminated window displays to draw in customers– it also offered a money back guarantee although it accepted only cash into the s the store also produced its own madetomeasure clothing for both men and women assembled in an onsite factory in  macy took on two partners robert m valentine – a nephew and abiel t la forge – of wisconsin who was the husband of a cousin macy died in  from inflammatory kidney disease then known as brights disease la forge died the following year and valentine died in  ownership of the company remained in the macy family until  when the company now called r h macy  co was acquired by isidor straus and his brother nathan straus who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the macys store in  the flagship store moved uptown to herald square at th street and broadway so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from th street to th street although the herald square store initially consisted of just one building it expanded through new construction eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by seventh avenue on the west broadway on the east th street on the south and th street on the north with the exception of a small preexisting building on the corner of th street and seventh avenue and another on the corner of th street and broadway this latter story building was purchased by robert h smith in  for  equivalent to  million in  – an incredible sum at the time – with the idea of getting in the way of macys becoming the largest store in the world it is largely supposed that smith who was a neighbor of the macys store on th street was acting on behalf of siegelcooper which had built what they thought was the worlds largest store on sixth avenue in  macys ignored the tactic and simply built around the building which now carries macys shopping bag sign by lease arrangement in  isidor straus died in the sinking of the titanic at the age of  with his wife ida the original broadway store was designed by architects de lemos  cordes was built in – by the fuller company and has a palladian facade but has been updated in many details there were further additions to the west in  and  and the seventh avenue building in  all designed by architect robert d kohn the newer buildings were increasingly art deco in style in  macys began the first full renovation of the iconic herald square flagship store at a reported cost of us studio v architecture a new yorkbased firm was the overall master plan architect of the project studio vs fresh design of the department store raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration the building was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in  the store has several wooden escalators still in operation expansion and bankruptcyedit the problem of preexisting buildings also presented itself when macys built a store on queens boulevard in elmhurst in the new york city borough of queens this resulted in a unique round department store on  percent of the lot with a small privately owned house on the corner macys no longer fully occupies this building which now contains the queens place mall with macys furniture gallery as a tenant instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby queens center this relocation was the result of macys merger with federated department stores the parent company of abraham  straus in  which led to the latter being absorbed by the former more distant acquisitions included lasalle  koch toledo  davisonpaxonstokes atlanta  l bamberger  co newark  oconnor moffat  company san francisco  and john taylor dry goods co kansas city  oconnor

rowland hussey macy who between  and  opened four retail dry goods stores including the original macys store in downtown haverhill massachusetts established in  to serve the mill industry employees of the area they all failed but he learned from his mistakes macy moved to new york city in  and established a new store named r h macy  co on sixth avenue between th and th streets which was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time on the companys first day of business on october   sales totaled us equal to  today from the beginning macys logo has included a star which comes from a tattoo that macy got as a teenager when he worked on a nantucket whaling ship the emily morgan as the business grew macys expanded into neighboring buildings opening more and more departments and used publicity devices such as a store santa claus themed exhibits and illuminated window displays to draw in customers– it also offered a money back guarantee although it accepted only cash into the s the store also produced its own madetomeasure clothing for both men and women assembled in an onsite factory in  macy took on two partners robert m valentine – a nephew and abiel t la forge – of wisconsin who was the husband of a cousin macy died in  from inflammatory kidney disease then known as brights disease la forge died the following year and valentine died in  ownership of the company remained in the macy family until  when the company now called r h macy  co was acquired by isidor straus and his brother nathan straus who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the macys store in  the flagship store moved uptown to herald square at th street and broadway so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from th street to th street although the herald square store initially consisted of just one building it expanded through new construction eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by seventh avenue on the west broadway on the east th street on the south and th street on the north with the exception of a small preexisting building on the corner of th street and seventh avenue and another on the corner of th street and broadway this latter story building was purchased by robert h smith in  for  equivalent to  million in  – an incredible sum at the time – with the idea of getting in the way of macys becoming the largest store in the world it is largely supposed that smith who was a neighbor of the macys store on th street was acting on behalf of siegelcooper which had built what they thought was the worlds largest store on sixth avenue in  macys ignored the tactic and simply built around the building which now carries macys shopping bag sign by lease arrangement in  isidor straus died in the sinking of the titanic at the age of  with his wife ida the original broadway store was designed by architects de lemos  cordes was built in – by the fuller company and has a palladian facade but has been updated in many details there were further additions to the west in  and  and the seventh avenue building in  all designed by architect robert d kohn the newer buildings were increasingly art deco in style in  macys began the first full renovation of the iconic herald square flagship store at a reported cost of us studio v architecture a new yorkbased firm was the overall master plan architect of the project studio vs fresh design of the department store raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration the building was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in  the store has several wooden escalators still in operation expansion and bankruptcyedit the problem of preexisting buildings also presented itself when macys built a store on queens boulevard in elmhurst in the new york city borough of queens this resulted in a unique round department store on  percent of the lot with a small privately owned house on the corner macys no longer fully occupies this building which now contains the queens place mall with macys furniture gallery as a tenant instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby queens center this relocation was the result of macys merger with federated department stores the parent company of abraham  straus in  which led to the
