painful death at the hands of amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn over the last few months a variety of retailers have reported lower sales and dwindling profits as online shopping continues to grow like weedswith that many retailers have begun the process of rightsizing their portfolios ie conducting store closures and laying off workers those in more dire straits have even filed for bankruptcy in the wake of rising online sales bankruptcy filings for retailers are up over  this year alone apple iphone  possibly delayed management hopes new emoji will keep buyers happy it shouldn’t come as a surprise those reits that focus on the retail sector have been hit especially hard after all with stores closing and sales down it stands to reason that rents will go unfilled and investors will be given the shafton top of this the federal reserve is adding gasoline to the dumpster fire that is retail rising interest rates poise a problem for reits or so the perception goes thanks to their tax structure reits kickout much of their cash flows as dividends and thusly have high yields that’s great when bonds and other fixed income products are paying out  but with the fed raising rates and bonds once again getting attractive from an income point of view reits and their added risks are no longer seen as greatmaking matters even worse for reits is their higher than average debts tied to mortgages as the fed raises rates rolling over those mortgages will be a lot more expensive as yellen  company keep raisingso for a retail reit like o you have a dying sector coupled with rising rates and investors aren’t having any of that shares of realty income are well off of their week highs and are down  over the last year it’s not that bad at obut here’s the thing it’s not that bad for o to

spinoff to form new energy mlp as for the fed things aren’t as bad for o as they are made out to be like a lot of topnotch reits management at o saw the rate hikes coming and with that they’ve spent much of the last few years using the lower rates to their advantage that meant retiring expensive and high yielding preferred stock shares and issuing long term bonds at current favorable rates realty
