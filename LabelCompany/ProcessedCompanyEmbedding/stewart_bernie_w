addiction of the rich and famousbyf rothon april  format kindle editionverified purchaselying seems epidemic in american society stewart focuses his superb writing skills on the general problem of perjury and lying under oath by highlighting the cases of four celebrated liars martha stewart no apparent relation to the author scooter libby barry bonds and bernie madoff for each of these he asks the same question why would people with so much to lose put so much at risk by lying under oath ultimately the answer becomes obvious they thought they could get away with itstewart uses extensive sources for his own narration chief among these are notes from investigations court proceedings and personal interviews although the book is nonfiction its a pageturner because the machinations of the perpetrators and their victims are suspenseful ensnaring and powerfully emotional each of the perpetrators would ultimately explain their deceits as motivated by loyalty but this seems mostly selfserving and devious whatever loyalty they had in mind was to themselves as all were readily prepared to let underlings and associates take hard falls to cushion their own in the end most of the celebrity liars recovered reasonably with the exception of madoff who will be in prison for a long time and has lost the love of his family and seen one of his sons commit suicide pursuant to the shame he showered on themthese continuing losses of madoff as well as those of bonds recently convicted of obstruction of justice arent covered in the book which was written in  although published in this book has several strengths and perhaps just one weakness the strengths are the readable and interesting writing about largerthanlife heroes turned villains as he points out these villains evidently expect to be admired for this behavior meticulously researched and artfully written the book provides considerable details easily read and enjoyed it also addresses a central problem lying under oath that undermines civilization itselfif the book has a weakness it would be its failure to look at the bigger picture in order to frame the problem more usefully to bring it perhaps closer to an appropriate remedy the bigger problem in my opinion is that lying is rampant throughout all of society not just at the level of criminal investigations and judicial proceedings while its true that celebrities routinely lie to protect their wealth and status the problem seems far more extensive we have in the us a system rigged for the rich and powerful whether individuals or corporations that rewards lying as business as usual why is that two reasons primarily  lying pays and  liars are not punished that might sound hard to believe if youve not actually investigated it however there are few laws against lying they are usually not enforced and in many casessuch as politicsthe supreme court protects liars the court has ruled that politicians can routinely lie and broadcasters must be willing if they are not already eager to sell to the liars and their campaign organizations advertising time to carry those lies to as many people as they can possibly infectso when stewart suggests that fixing this problem requires a capacity for moral outrage hes right but as a remedy that prescription falls far short to bring the epidemic under control we are going to need to invent and employ new solutions for example snopes on the web publicizes some lies urban myths and many people check snopes before they pass lies along politifact and factcheck two other web sites investigate political lies and policy lies new products such as wolfram alpha stateoftheusa and numerous regional indicators projects aim to provide curated and reliable answers to important questions wikipedia enables many people to edit and polish statements hopefully bringing them rapidly to a state of truth a new organization truthsealorg offers means for people and organizations to affix seals of truth to their vetted claims and to offer bounties for people to present falsifying evidence in these and other ways we might create stronger incentives for truth telling and stimulate social networks of people to ferret out lies in the public information commons by changing the incentives rewarding truth tellers and punishing liars we could hope to begin to change the course of this rampant social diseasewithout some change to the rules of the game we should continue to expect the same outcomes over and overin fairness to stewart he wanted to tell a compelling story and get people thinking seriously about how our society encourages obviously sociopathic behavior he does that extremely well another book will be required to look at the bigger more general problem consider the situation from a problemsolving point of view and lay out the best courses of action for implementing remedies readers who might be interested in my own study of that problem and proposed recovery plan should consider truthiness fever how lies and propaganda are poisoning us and a tenstep program for recovery comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert

a financial feature reporter he gets to the bottom of a complex series of events and explains them with unsurpassed clarity and objectivity if you are interested in the subject hes describing there is no better source for learning about it and those skills are on display in the four lyingrelated scandals he discusses here martha stewart scooter libby barry bonds and other balco defendants and bernie madoff in each story stewarts focus is on the lies the subject told to official investigators and since such lying is much closer to the heart of the stewart and libby scandals than to the bonds and madoff events for the latter two official lies were more of an interesting sidelight than the core of what will put them in the history books i found those portions of the book the most interesting and enlightening indeed for martha stewart and scooter libbey tangled webs should stand as the definitive treatment read this and youll get it in opening and concluding sections the author ties the four stories together by shucking his customary objectivity for a jeremiade against perjury and official lying he has passionate feelings on the subject that no doubt were part of the source of his energy that allowed him to so meticulously record these events while i am more than sympathetic to his views on this pointin my case he is preaching to the choiri did not find those parts of the book particularly persuasive they are not the reason to buy it this may be in part because of the very excellencethe irrefutable closely documented objectivityof the main body of the book this is

uncertain whether to read that chapter either but i read the first two and thoroughly enjoyed and was enlightened by them is it fair for me to give a review to a book that i have only half read and

purchasetangled webs is the story of four very complicated recent cases martha stewart and the insider trading scandal scooter libby and the valerie plame cia outing barry bonds and steroid use in professional sportsand bernie madoff and his ponizi schemeall four of these stories have been exhaustively covered in newspapers magazines online stories and in television over long periods of time which made them complicated because these venues presented pieces of the story at any given time when i first learned of the publication of this book i hesitated to buy it because i am wary of most peoples ability to tell a complicated story in an easy to understand fashion but i was keenly interested in the subject matter and i had faith that the author could do it based on his past writings the purchase was well worth it mr stewart presented each story in an easy to understand way by taking all the pieces people testimony emails letters television shows stories etc and presenting them in chronological order that no newspaper or magazine writer or television producer has been able to do his research is exhaustive and i finished the book knowing so much more than before i picked it up i also walked away disappointed in not only the four main characters but in other characters and the regulatory agencies that are in existence to enforce the laws of this country the author asserts that lying and perjury is at an epidemic and after reading the book i think anyone would be hard pressed not to agree what troubles me is and is by no way reflective of the author but instead of the world as it is martha stewart should have been charged with insider trading as should alisa waksul and sam waksuls father karl rove and richard armitage should have been charged with outing valerie plame a covert cia agent barry bonds and all the other professional athletes who have been taking steroids should be charged with using prohibitive substances to enhance their athletic abilities the sec should have uncovered madoffs ponzi schemethe stories leave me disappointed in the subject characters but also in the characters that are holding them to the standards we call lawscommentwas this

tangled webs penguin press new york  the subtitle alone persuaded me the author was on to something important how false statements are undermining america from martha stewart to bernie madoff but my love was not to be i read my way to the very last page more out of a sense of professional obligation than due to any sense that i was about to discover something new and importanti did notbut i did learn more than i ever thought i wanted to know about the nuts and bolts of the martha stewart prosecution and the prosecution of barry bonds i read the sections on bernie madoff but i still do not understand the investigation of him yes i get that his investment firm was merely a gigantic ponzi scheme but the covering scam he used to deceive regulators and investors remains impenetrable to me i am not sure that is stewart’s fault but i suspect it isstewart is of course right the administration of justice depends on truthtelling if we lie with impunity then the center will not hold got it in an ideal and transparent world discovery of facts would be what the law school professors used to call a mere matter of proofstewart has a lopsided view of the world he frets about the consequences of witnesses who lie to the government without ever stopping to consider what happens when government lies to the people this gives the book a quaint s kind of feel if we all just told the truth why everything would be all rightreality is and frankly always has been a lot more nuancedthe government has perverted the grand jury process a device once intended to protect people from an overreaching government is now a secret tool the government uses to launch lengthy and intrusive searches the cloak of grand jury secrecy is used to justify a onesided game of hide and go seek a federal agent might knock on your door to ask questions he won’t tell you what others have said about you he will tell you he cannot relay such information but he will question you if you permit him to do so and he will take notes if those notes don’t match the account given by another witness you just might face a federal prosecution for lying to a federal official we let government define the truth while permitting it to deceivecan someone tell me why it is a crime to lie to the government but mere business as usual for the government to withhold the truth the current rhetoric is that the government needs investigative tools to protect us against crime there was a time in which we viewed ourselves more in need of protection from government all we like sheep have gone astray we don’t even know how many crimes are defined in the penal codes of the state and federal governments we’re broke and yet we imprison more folks per capita and for longer periods than any other nation on earth there’s something wrong here all rightthe fact that a few privileged plutocrats lied to the government and got caught is not what is undermining america stewart spend no time arguing this proposition what is undermining the nation is the loss of a common set of interests and a common conception of right the very things that cicero long ago taught define a commonwealth there is a crisis of legitimacy in the nation that runs far deeper than a few isolated prosecutionsi recently watched an interview with san francisco’s tony serra on the topic of snitching or becoming an informant for the government serra argues that it is wrong to snitch it undermines a person’s sense of honor and it undermines the adversarial process thus turning us all into potential agents of the state when the price offered for what we have to say is right the government can buy witnesses with liberty serra argues a defendant who offers something to a witness gets charged with witness tampering this asymmetry is fatal to libertyso too with lying we get the government we deserve if we permit government to lie with impunity that cheapens the value of truth is it any wonder that a people distrustful of its government will lie to government agentsclients who lie to government agents face the risk of jail time they face that risk even if they tell the truth so long as the government chooses to credit the contradictory tales told by another as truth the fact of the matter is that determining what is truth is rarely simply a mere matter of proof sometimes the truth is a matter of what one chooses to see giving the government a set of twoway mirrors in its search for truth blinds the very people and makes engaging the government risky business for us allgo ahead and read stewart’s book it won’t hurt you it is a painstaking recreation of several highprofile cases the book can be read with profit by any criminal defense lawyer handling whitecollar criminal cases but don’t read the book to see what is undermining america stewart hasn’t a clue he apparently believes that if we all just rolled over and gave the government what it wanted all would be well in this the best of all possible

real crime but reads like a crime dramabysueon june  format hardcoververified purchasethe book kept my attention all the way through its a potentially dull topic perjury in high places but mr stewart kept it moving along witout adding artificial drama there is a lot of detailas was mentioned in at least one published review that i read but mr stewart did an excellent job of letting me know why it was all relevant happily he also repeated identification of participants attorneys and such who are not well known names so i was able to keep on reading without having to search back to figure out who the person is it was like getting three books in one and each kept me turning the pages i also learned from it which was my hope when i bought the book i really expected it to read more like a public policy text book and i imagine it may become that as wellcomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web
