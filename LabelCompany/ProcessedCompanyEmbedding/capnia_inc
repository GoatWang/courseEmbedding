babies are born in the us and europe each year  of these babies will develop jaundice in many babies this is a normal condition that can be easily treated babies with both hyperbilirubinemia and hemolysis are at greatest risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes however in some newborns jaundice is not normal and is caused by an underlying hemolytic condition untreated jaundice has a range of clinical and financial impacts for patients and hospitals according to the aap guidelines newborns with a hemolytic condition need to receive phototherapy at lower levels of bilirubin than other newborns since  the american academy of pediatrics has recommended the use of etco testing aap guidelines recommend the use of etco testing in newborns  weeks’ gestation or more who are receiving phototherapy or have tsb rising rapidly or have tsb approaching transfusion levels or have jaundice unexplained by history and physical published data show that etco testing unlike blood tests provides an accurate measure of hemolysis the american academy of pediatrics aap has recommended the use of etco to directly measure bilirubin production rates in newborns multiple clinical trials
