university of california berkeley and the wharton school university of pennsylvania and in the pages of institutional investor and the wall street journal our research helped to change the course of modern investment management by demonstrating that the supposedly efficient equity market offered potential profit opportunities that could be identified and exploited in the s jacobs and levy began to publish a series of articles articulating the investment philosophy that had emerged from their research these articles appeared in the peerreviewed financial analysts journal journal of portfolio management journal of investing operations research and journal of financial perspectives our seminal insight is that equity market returns are driven by complex combinations of company fundamentals macroeconomic conditions and behavioral factors and that these effects can be detected with the use of extensive modeling grounded in intuitive and theoretically plausible relationships exploiting these relationships requires simultaneous analysis of numerous variables across a broad and diverse range of stocks portfolio optimization and performance attribution systems that are customized to the security selection process sophisticated trading techniques and creative researcharticlessecurity selection the articles abstracted here address jacobs levy equity management’s view of the market as a complex system and some of the methods that can best be used to “disentangle” this complexity us equity market returns are driven by complex combinations of company fundamentals such as earnings and growth rates macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and inflation and behavioral factors such as investors’ tendency to overreact to news and events as a result the market is permeated by a complex web of interrelated return regularities disentangling this web allows potentially profitable investment opportunities to emerge “the complexity of the stock market” first appeared in the th anniversary issue of the journal of portfolio management and was selected for inclusion in streetwise the best of the journal of portfolio management this article demonstrates that active quantitative investing despite the assertions of the efficient market theorists and random walk advocates is not a futile task at the same time it explains why simple investment techniques such as buying lowpe stocks cannot provide consistent outperformance identifying the complex web of interrelationships that underlie stock price movements and exploiting them for profitable investing requires

reserved disentangling equity return regularities new insights and investment opportunities by bruce i jacobs and kenneth n levy financial analysts journal mayjune  robust insights into stock price behavior emerge only from an analysis that carefully considers numerous factors simultaneously naïve attempts to relate returns and potential return predictors do not take correlation into account quintiling or univariate analysis for instance naively assumes that prices are responding only to the variable under consideration by contrast simultaneous analysis of all relevant variables takes into account and adjusts for any correlations the results of such analysis provide a truer picture of real returnpredictor relationships “disentangling equity return regularities new insights and investment opportunities” describes jacobs levy’s pioneering methodology for “disentangling” and “purifying” return effects via multivariate analysis disentangling distinguishes real effects from mere proxies and real investment opportunities from spurious ones disentangling is of the utmost importance because it results in the “pure” returns to a given predictor uncontaminated by the possible effects of other related variables these pure returns are less volatile and more predictable than the naïve return estimates produced by less rigorous methodologies “disentangling” won a graham  dodd

press publications ten investment insights that matter by bruce i jacobs and kenneth n levy journal of portfolio management special th anniversary issue september this article discusses the key insights that inform our investment process developed over  years of research and portfolio management these insights and the resulting rewards to active management stem from the realization that the

kenneth n levy financial analysts journal novemberdecember many years ago bruce jacobs and ken levy demonstrated that there is much greater dimensionality to the stock market than is suggested by the onefactor capital asset pricing model investors today continue to underestimate the market’s dimensionality through their recent embrace of “smart beta” strategies such strategies assume a market in which a few chosen factors produce persistent returns in reality there are numerous factors that produce returns which vary over time those returns can best be captured by a multidimensional approach

anomaly research has focused on one or two return regularities at a time this seminal article demonstrates that multivariate regression can provide a unified framework for “disentangling” and analyzing numerous return effects simultaneously disentangling purifies the effect of each anomaly affording a clearer picture of which anomalies are “real” and which are merely proxies for other effectswhile pure payoffs may be smaller than the naïve payoffs of univariate analyses given the independent nature of the pure effects and the proxying behavior of the naïve effects their statistical significance is often greater the residual reversal effect is an exception emerging stronger in magnitude in its pure form than its naïve form primarily because the pure measure separates out related effects such as earnings surprise some effects including cash flowprice disappear completely in their pure form and both naïve and pure returns to beta prove inconsequential in explaining cumulative returnsthe strength and persistence of returns to such anomaly measures as trends in analysts’ earnings estimates represent evidence against semistrong market efficiency the significant payoffs to measures such as residual reversal suggest that past prices alone do matter—that is the market is not even weak—form efficient controlling for taxloss selling and other attributes in a multivariate framework mitigates the january seasonals exhibited by many of the naïve anomaly measures for instance the small size effect’s january seasonal vanishes the yield effect’s january seasonal remains strong however also because longterm taxloss selling is more powerful than shortterm investor behavior appears suboptimal a negative january seasonal in pure returns to the relativestrength measure appears to arise from profittaking associated with taxgain deferralreturns to many attributes appear to have marketrelated components for example naïve returns to low pe behave defensively while pure returns to low pe are not marketrelated at all apparently naïve returns to low pe are proxies for related defensive effects such as the yield effect returns to beta however are strongly procyclical in

different economic environments the issue then is how to define style a “highdefinition” approach looks at many stock attributes and disentangles the effects of each this results in a detailed map of

simply means that the model used for analyzing individual stocks should incorporate all information available from a broad universe of stocks “engineering portfolios a unified approach” which appeared as the lead article in a special technology issue of the journal of investing discusses the many benefits of taking a broad unified approach to the investment problem such an approach offers a coherent framework for analysis one in which each stock in the universe has one and only one alpha and in which each can be related to every other stock in the universe a unified approach can also take advantage of more information than a narrower view of the market can provide of practical importance is the fact that a broad unified approach allows the investment manager to “engineer” portfolios designed to outperform various clientspecified mandates  a broad unified approach combined with the power of a security selection system based on an appropriate multivariate analysis of a large number of return predictors allows for numerous insights into profit opportunities and improves the goodness of those insights this in turn can lead to more consistent portfolio performance the process of translating the insights into the performance is the process of portfolio engineering  a portfolio optimization process that is customized to include exactly the same dimensions found relevant by the stock selection process helps to ensure that all the opportunities detected by the modeling process are exploited while all the risks detected are accounted for and controlled the aim of portfolio engineering should be to provide the maximum possible expected return for the desired level of risk “residual risk how much is too much” considers the portfolio engineering problem within the broader context of the investors risk policy in particular it demonstrates that the investor must factor into the portfolio selection decision the level of manager skill—the managers ability to

using short positions in conjunction with long positions in a portfolio framework we soon realized the real benefits of this approach emerge only if one employs a single “integrated optimization” that considers long positions and short positions simultaneously in this framework longshort is not a twoportfolio strategy in which a portfolio of longs is somehow combined with a separately optimized portfolio of shorts rather it is a oneportfolio strategy in which the long and short positions are determined jointly within an optimization that takes into account the expected returns of the individual securities the standard deviation of those returns and the correlations between them as well as the investors tolerance for risk only with an integrated optimization is a longshort portfolio not constrained by benchmark weights the ensuing benefits are described in “longshort management an integrated approach” this article along with “on the optimality of longshort strategies” describes the conditions under which a dollar or betaneutral portfolio is optimal portfolios with both long and short positions however present a problem when it comes to optimization we examined this problem closely most recently in “trimability and fast optimization of longshort portfolios” our research indicates that the same algorithms used for optimizing longonly portfolios can be used unchanged for portfolios that contain short positions—provided a certain condition holds this condition which we term “trimability” usually holds in practice another issue that arises with regard to portfolios with short positions is the leverage involved leverage whether in longshort portfolios or in portfolios with leveraged long positions introduces risks that are distinct from the risk captured by a volatility measure these include the possibility of losses beyond the capital invested and the potential for margin calls which may necessitate forced selling perhaps at adverse prices these risks are not reflected in traditional meanvariance analysis which considers only volatility risk and can lead to portfolios with very high leverage levels in “traditional optimization is not optimal for leverageaverse investors” we propose that leverage aversion be included as an explicit term along with volatility aversion in the optimization of leveraged portfolios this results in a

beginning with the original blackscholesmerton model for some purposes it may be sufficient to assume that prices follow a continuoustime process often however it is necessary to look more closely to determine how prices actually evolve investment actions themselves may change the price process certain investment strategies for example can have feedback effects consider momentum trading which tends to exacerbate trends in prices momentum traders helped to fuel the stock markets rise in the late s changing the price process in ways that a continuoustime model would have had difficulty predicting by contrast a model that incorporated the actual trading rules of major market participants at that time might have been able to forecast the growing technology stock bubble for a description of momentum trading’s effects on markets see bruce jacobs “momentum trading the new alchemy” the jacobs levy markowitz simulator “jlmsim” developed by bruce jacobs ken levy and harry markowitz is an asynchronous discretetime model that allows its users to model financial markets employing their own inputs about the numbers and types of investors traders and securities it does not assume that a process changes continuously over time instead it assumes that changes reflect events which unfold in an irregular fashion prices may thus be discontinuous gapping up or down the jlmsim can be used to detect how prices might change as the result of changes in financial market regulations or even something more subtle such as a change in the composition of market participants asynchronous models may also be superior when the question to be analyzed is whether microtheories about the behavior of investors add up to the observed macrophenomena of the market from time to time the market manifests liquidity “black holes” which seem to defy rational investor behavior consider the stock market crash on october   that day prices fell precipitously and discontinuously while one might have expected rational value investors to step in to pick up bargain stocks few did similar black holes developed in connection with the collapse of the hedge fund longterm capital management in  and more recently during the  credit crisis in these and other less extreme cases the price process was not fixed continuoustime modeling that assumes a fixed price process would have provided misleading results whereas asynchronous models may be able to explain both the abundance of sellers and the dearth of buyers for detailed descriptions of such events see bruce i jacobs capital ideas and market realities option replication investor behavior and stock market crashes “risk avoidance and market fragility” and “tumbling tower of babel subprime securitization and the credit crisis”  it is important to recognize that large traders may not be mere pricetakers they can affect prices we believe an asynchronoustime market simulator such as jlmsim which is capable of modeling the agents and market mechanisms behind observed prices is much better equipped than continuoustime models to capture this reality of markets for this reason we believe the jlmsim will stimulate much future

discretetime models whose clocks advance in irregular intervals from one event to the next can provide information that the more commonly used continuoustime models cannot they can be used for example to test the effects on security prices of realworld events such as changes in investors’ strategies modifications in overall leverage or switches in regulatory regimes the present paper uses an asynchronous discretetime model to demonstrate the effects on market prices of different ways of estimating security returns and of different trading rules in particular it shows how variations in the ratio of momentumtype investors to valuetype investors can have dramatic effects on security prices when the ratio of momentum to value investors is large security prices tend to “explode” when the ratio is low prices fluctuate rather realistically but do not destabilize security prices can also become unstable when traders in a thin market do not use trading rules that “anchor” their bids and

credit crisis of  and ensuing economic malaise sprang from the collapse of a tower of structured finance products based on subprime mortgage loans the relatively high returns on structured products created demand for them which helped fuel mortgage lending facilitating more purchases of homes and in turn putting upward pressure on prices this dynamic was abetted by the seeming safety of the products which encouraged leverage in lender and investor balance sheets as lenders exhausted the pool of possible homebuyers however housing prices began to decline in many parts of the us the downside risk of housingmarket prices became manifest as the systematic risk of housingprice losses was shifted to lenders and investors the solvency of some of the institutions that had built the tower of structured products came into question the real risk of subprime mortgage investing blew up financial firms and in turn economies worldwide bruce jacobs describes this process in “tumbling tower of babel subprime securitization and the credit crisis”  products designed to reduce risk for mortgage lenders and investors in mortgagerelated products ended up creating huge risks for the system as a whole the past quarter century has witnessed multiple versions of this same story played out by various financial actors in the s a strategy known as portfolio insurance based on thennew theories of option pricing purported to reduce the downside risks of equity investing while preserving upside potential in essence portfolio insurance aimed to create an optionlike put on equity holdings via a trading strategy that called for selling stock as stock prices declined and buying stock as stock prices rose this mechanistic trading contributed to the crash of october   as jacobs outlines in “option theory and its unintended consequences”  in his book capital ideas and market realities jacobs details the role played by portfolio insurance in the  crash and goes on to discuss subsequent crises caused or exacerbated by similar or related strategies these include actual options when popular demand for puts forces option dealers to engage in the same type of mechanistic trading required by portfolio insurance and less intuitively the type of arbitrage trades made by hedge funds such as longterm capital management ltcm’s trades were theoretically so low risk that leverage of  to  times capital was required to get the fund’s risk levels up to the desired equity market level yet these highly leveraged supposedly lowrisk and globally diversified strategies all fell apart at the same time when turmoil set off by russia’s de facto default stampeded investors toward safety and liquidity then the need to unwind arbitrage positions created the same trading patterns as portfolio insurance—selling into down markets and buying into rising markets jacobs focuses on this phenomenon in “when seemingly infallible arbitrage strategies fail” and “a tale of two hedge funds”   capital ideas and market realities “a tale of two hedge funds” and “tumbling tower of babel” also discuss how leverage helped to ignite and then spread the fires in the ltcm and  crises the risks of leverage are too often ignored modern portfolio theory for example focuses on volatility risk but has little to say about the risks of leverage other than its contribution to volatility reliance on conventional optimization techniques can thus give rise to portfolios that are highly leveraged the articles in the section “optimization short sales and leverage aversion” describe the unique risks of leverage and offer a possible solution in the form of a meanvarianceleverage optimization model that incorporates investor leverage aversion  another common thread of these crises is the seemingly general lack of appreciation for the difference between risk sharing and risk shifting jacobs’s “risk avoidance and market fragility” discusses these differences risksharing can reduce risk as diversification of the specific risks within a portfolio reduces overall portfolio risk but riskshifting merely moves risk from one party to another risk shifting tends to reduce investors’ perceptions of the risks they are incurring thereby encouraging more risktaking overall risk in the system however remains and increases as investors take on more risk eventually markets become

the point that many lost sight of the real risks of the underlying loans this sense of safety in turn encouraged more lending more securitized products and more leverage but the systematic risk of the loans remained when house price appreciation slowed in many areas of the country and then reversed a large number of borrowers especially subprime borrowers began to default on their mortgages the

portfolio for your investing goals  this new edition of equity management reflects  years of research and investment practice by two pioneers of quantitative equity investing in the s bruce jacobs and ken levy published in peerreviewed journals a series of articles on detecting and exploiting the factors that significantly influence stock returns since then they have examined short selling in the context of longshort portfolios optimization of portfolios with short sales or other leveraged positions markets in crisis and models that can simulate realistic market behavior equity management the art and science of modern quantitative investing includes the classic  articles from the original edition plus  articles that were published since the first edition appeared together they present a compelling argument for the benefits of a quantitative approach in a complex multidimensional and dynamic factor world the chapters are grouped into eight parts with introductory material that places each section within the broader context of the investment body of knowledge part  examines the intricacies of stock price behavior and focuses on detecting the characteristics or factors behind them security prices are neither efficient nor random and unpredictable rather the market is a complex system permeated by a web of return regularities these regularities must be “disentangled” to arrive at the real sources of return this requires analyzing numerous promising returnpredictor relationships simultaneously part  looks at how best to exploit the investment opportunities detected the chapters outline a holistic approach that is multidimensional and dynamic viewing the market as integrated allows for greater breadth of investigation and greater depth of analysis hence enhances the potential for more and better insights a dynamic multidimensional proprietary approach that can adapt to changes in the underlying environment is better poised to capture opportunities than an approach that restricts itself to a small number of wellknown and static factors part  examines how short sales can expand investment opportunities and improve performance balancing long and short positions within a portfolio creates a marketneutral portfolio whose performance should reflect the returns and risks of the constituent securities but not the performance of the overall market the return from security selection can be transported to virtually any asset class via derivatives allowing the investor to take advantage of manager skill wherever it lies while maintaining any desired asset allocation part  focuses on another longshort approach—enhanced active equity or  type portfolios these portfolios retain full exposure to the market return while pursuing excess returns via short positions and leveraged long positions the development of  type portfolios was motivated by jacobs and levy’s research into optimization of longshort portfolios which showed that the optimization process should consider long positions short positions and any benchmark holding simultaneously the authors also tackled a problem that arises when optimizing portfolios that contain both long and short positions as the chapters in part  explain the factor or scenario models of covariance that simplify the optimization process for longonly portfolios do not necessarily apply to longshort portfolios jacobs and levy working with harry markowitz provide a solution they call “trimability” part  addresses the unique risks of leverage which are distinct from the risk captured by standard deviation or volatility most notable is the risk that a margin call can force the unwinding of positions the meanvariance model central to modern portfolio theory does not consider these unique risks and can thus lead to “optimal” portfolios with very high leverage the authors present an alternative model—meanvarianceleverage optimization—that allows an investor who is both volatilityaverse and leverageaverse to assess the utility of a portfolio high levels of leverage almost led to the demise of hedge fund longterm capital management in  and to the disruption of the entire financial system in  part  examines these episodes and other periods of market crisis including the  stock market crash one conclusion is that products and strategies that promise increased returns at reduced risk have attracted investors encouraged leverage and too often precipitated not only their own demise but also the nearcollapse of the global economy part  presents work undertaken with harry markowitz on a model for simulating market behavior the jacobs levy markowitz market simulator jlmsim allows users to create their own market models from the bottom up by specifying the numbers and types of market entities including portfolio analysts traders and investors as well as their decision rules the results so far suggest that types of investors value versus momentum as well

this impressive collection of their research articles provides important insights into a broad assortment of topics ranging from security analysis to portfolio construction techniques this book should be part of the library of academics and practitioners alike” a craig mackinlay joseph p wargrove professor of finance the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania “i made the work of jacobs and levy required reading for my portfolio management class and if still teaching would continue to do so their work combines rigorous academic research with valuable insights into the real world of investment practice one of their many insights is that an optimized combination of long and short positions is well suited to exploit relative security valuations because many investors cannot act on negative information by selling short there are more opportunities for shorts for those who can sell short and who know how to integrate their short positions with their long positions that is a major advantage equity management should be on the bookshelf of every serious student of the stock market today” edward m miller professor of economics and finance university of new orleans “while factor investing is today in the mainstream of portfolio management understanding and successfully executing on multidimensional exposures is nuanced that is the main point of this excellently written book the authors powerfully lay out how factor opportunities are driven by patterns of investor demand which means that factor identification is necessarily a dynamic process and factor returns and risks are not stationary this is an important book for anyone concerned with alpha generation and portfolio construction” andré perold george gund professor of finance and banking emeritus harvard university “bruce jacobs and ken levy walk us through their year legacy of important insightful and frequently cuttingedge research articles the accompanying commentary places this research in financial history from the early days of quant equity management through the rise of hedge funds from the rise of leverage through the systemic risks that have wreaked havoc across the globe this book

behavioral factors underlying stock returns form the basis of the firms unique multidimensional and dynamic approach to investingthis book brings together for the first time jacobs and levys groundbreaking articles from the industrys preeminent journals these introduce such key concepts as disentangling the sources of security returns engineering portfolios to performance benchmarks and longshort investing for exploiting both winning and losing stocks new introductory material provides a fascinating review of the concepts that form the foundation of modern active equity management

quantitative research in finance the new york society of security analysts the society of quantitative analysts and the berkeley program in finance their views and strategies have been featured in the pages of the wall street journal investors business daily institutional investor and pensions  investments bruce jacobs and ken levy have long been recognized as pioneers in quantitative equity management in the s they began to publish a series of articles in the peerreviewed financial analysts journal journal of portfolio management and journal of investing these articles were based on the authors own research into and experience with detecting and exploiting the recurring profit opportunities available in a supposedly efficient marketplace together they outline an approach for selecting stocks and constructing portfolios that has the potential to deliver superior returns over timeequity management collects  of these articles from s disentangling equity return regularities through s alpha transport with derivatives these are grouped into three parts that cover the range of jacobs and levys investment philosophy and strategy from selecting securities to engineering portfolios to expanding opportunities with short selling and derivatives new introductory material provides a perspective on the articles placing each within the broader context of the investment body of knowledgethe authors approach to security selection begins with the concept of a complex market in their view us security prices are not efficient nor random and unpredictable neither however is the market a simple system simple rules such as buy low pe or buy value will not be able to yield consistent investment profits rather a complex market is permeated by a web of return regularities furthermore these regularities are interrelated and must be disentangled in order to arrive at real sources of return disentangling requires analyzing multiple promising returnpredictor relationships simultaneously the resulting pure estimated returns are additive and more robust than those from simpler onefactor analysesthe breadth of returnpredictors considered in the security selection process as well as the depth of analysis help to capture the complexity of market pricing but predictors can differ across different types of stocks this dimension of complexity is best captured by viewing the broadest possible range of stocks through a wideangle analytical lens this is the case when the model used for analyzing individual stocks incorporates all the information available from the broad universe of stocks this approach offers a coherent framework for analysis and is poised to take advantage of more information than a narrower view of the market one focusing on particular styles or segments for example might providemaximizing the opportunities detected in the security selection process requires a disciplined approach to portfolio construction quantitative techniques such as optimization are best suited to ensuring that opportunities are maximized while risks are controlled proprietary portfolio optimization in which the portfolio is optimized along the same dimensions that are considered in the security selection process can further enhance portfolio performanceallowing for short sales expands investment opportunities hence has the potential to improve performance when long and short positions are balanced the resulting portfolio is market neutral its performance should reflect the returns and risks of the individual constituent securities but not the performance of the market from which those securities were selected long and short positions are best determined in a single integrated optimization this frees the portfolio from benchmark weight constraints and allows it more flexibility in the pursuit of return and control of riska longshort portfolio reflects the ability of the manager to select securities the alpha or excess return from this security selection can be transported along with its associated risk to virtually any desired asset class via the purchase of derivatives on that asset class the investor can thus take advantage of manager skill wherever it lies while maintaining an asset allocation that would not ordinarily encompass the securities exploited by the skilled managertogether the articles in equity management

levy to answer some common questions in questions and answers about market neutral investing for instance can neutrality be achieved by combining a portfolio holding long positions with one holding short positions arent short positions inherently riskier than long positions should an investor use a single manager or multiple managers to best exploit market neutral strategies in transporting alpha bruce jacobs and ken levy show how the excess alpha return from a market neutral strategy can be combined with the systematic return on virtually any asset class offering plan sponsors and investment managers the ability to optimize the returns from both asset allocation and security selection bruce jacobs and ken levy go on to examine two notorious market neutral failures dissecting the cases of askin capital management a firm that specialized in mortgage arbitrage and longterm capital management which dealt in sovereign fixedincome merger arbitrage and equity option and longshort trading these two cases provide some object lessons for investors considering market neutral managers investors and managers alike may gain much needed insight into the taxation of market neutral investing from significant tax considerations for taxable investors in market neutral strategies by peter e pront and john e tavss of seward  kissel seward  kissels peter pront and s john ryan follow up with a look at some tax and legal concerns for taxexempt investors in market neutral strategies in taxexempt organizations and other special categories of investors their potential contribution to overall fund diversification has been one of the primary selling points for market neutral strategies these strategies have much to offer beyond diversification however they can be used for example to exploit opportunities in markets that might otherwise be considered too risky for suitable investment they can allow investors to finetune portfolio risk exposures they can also be used to enhance return the ability to sell short for example allows the investor to seek out opportunities in overvalued securities as well as undervalued ones and one of the major advantages of market neutral construction is that it allows the investor to extract the return available from selecting securities in one asset class and by using derivatives to transport that return to an entirely different asset class allowing the investor to reap the rewards of both individual security selection and asset class selection foreword mark anson phd chief investment officer calpers chapter

submitted to several journals including financial analysts journal faj where they had been reviewed by mark rubinstein rubinstein a member of the journals’ editorial boards was also a cofounder of

submissionsgiven this history i was very pleasantly surprised to see a quite favorable review of cimr in the julyaugust  issue of faj book review editor martin fridson stated “jacobs’s meticulously documented book presents compelling evidence    that portfolio insurance failed to deliver on its lofty promises” in the januaryfebruary  issue of faj however fridson published an unprecedented postscript to this review in an abrupt aboutface the “postscript” charged that i “marshaled selected quotations to suggest that promotions in the early s by leland obrien rubinstein associates lor led investors to believe that its portfolio insurance product placed an absolute floor under their potential returns” on the contrary he asserts on the basis of various unnamed sources “lors pre

 issue of faj “postscript authors comment” my original reply “the marketing of portfolio insurance and the magnification of market risk the whole story” had to be cut substantially in order to meet the faj’s space constraints space in that same issue was nevertheless available to afford yet another comment from fridson “postscript reviewer’s response” fridson essentially concluded that “sophisticated investors who knew the right questions to ask would not have been misled” by lors marketingyet the latter statement is directly antithetical to securities law section  of the investment

anonymous sources “had no obvious reason either to attack jacobs or defend lor”  faj editor fong asserts in this article apparently unaware of rubinsteins admission “if there was pressure from someone on the editorial board i would see that person would not be on the board” fong nevertheless claimed in a followup article in pi “rubinstein to stay on editorial board of faj despite talking with fridson” that “the real question is was mark acting in his capacity as an editorial board member” rubinstein was not dismissedin the fall of  i posted an “open letter to aimr and the financial analysts journal” which documented apparent violations by certain members of the faj editorial board of all five professional conduct standards of the association of investment management and research since renamed the cfa institute this letter also documented violations of securities law and aimr standards by lor including its marketing of portfolio insurance as a “guaranteed equity investment” and its failures to adequately disclose the risks of the strategy the ethical issues involved including aimr’s tacit endorsement of a caveat emptor standard of disclosure and the conflicts of interest underlying faj’s editorial process were further discussed in a series of letters published in pi in the fall of a little less than a year later in july  aimr publicly proposed a set of research objectivity standards for buy and sellside analysts their firms issuing corporations and the media designed to curb conflictofinterest problems in the investment industry my response “bruce jacobs comments on aimrs proposed research objectivity standards recommending that aimr adopt such standards for its own publications” called on aimr to put their own house in order by instituting conflictofinterest and other standards for their own publications this recommendation was picked up by the wall street journal “bids  offers analyst heal thyself” and supported by letters from several aimr member societies this support was noted in an editorial in global investor which concluded that “the spirit of full transparency and objectivity has not been well served” by aimr in its handling of this mattersoon afterward aimr issued a press release “aimr announces new faj editor and new conflictofinterest policies” announcing that it had completed a review of faj’s standards policies and practices and found them in compliance with “best practice” and in keeping with aimrs code and standards the release went on to state that the ethical obligations and conflictofinterest policies governing faj would be published in an upcoming issue it also announced the appointment of a new editor for faj somewhat surprisingly aimr had not formally announced the departure of fong although pi

financial analysts journal conflictofinterest policies” setting forth violations of aimr conflictofinterest and other standards at faj in a cover letter to the aimr board i pointed out that publication of the letter would benefit readers by clarifying the standards of disclosure investment professionals are required to abide by and benefit aimr and faj by allowing faj to proceed with a clean slate under its new editor and newly announced policies aimr’s general counsel later informed me that the letter would not be published in “aimr and ‘best practices’ on ethics” pi december   however i question whether faj will opt for transparency and objectivity given its history and suggest that aimr take a page from the medical journals which provide for a full airing of questionable acts via letters and editorial commentary should faj accept anything less than this as “best practice”the whole debate revolving around faj going back to my original submission to the journal in the s raises extremely troubling questions about the conduct of the faj’s editor and members of its editorial board in addition it raises questions about the aimr’s supervision of faj and its willingness or ability to hold its officials and staff to the same high standards demanded of its members what level of disclosure on the part of investment advisers and managers would aimr desire to see promulgated in its own publications what standards of behavior would aimr expect its officials and staff to followin january  aimr finally published the conflictofinterest policies governing faj aimr is to be

behavior emerge only from an analysis that carefully considers numerous factors simultaneously naïve attempts to relate returns and potential return predictors do not take correlation into account quintiling or univariate analysis for instance naively assumes that prices are responding only to the variable under consideration by contrast simultaneous analysis of all relevant variables takes into account and adjusts for any correlations the results of such analysis provide a truer picture of real returnpredictor relationships “disentangling equity return regularities new insights and investment opportunities” describes jacobs levy’s pioneering methodology for “disentangling” and “purifying” return effects via multivariate analysis disentangling distinguishes real effects from mere proxies and real investment opportunities from spurious ones disentangling is of the utmost importance because it results in the “pure” returns to a given predictor uncontaminated by the possible effects of other related variables these pure returns are less volatile and more predictable than the naïve return estimates produced by less rigorous methodologies “disentangling” won a graham  dodd

anomaly research has focused on one or two return regularities at a time this seminal article demonstrates that multivariate regression can provide a unified framework for “disentangling” and analyzing numerous return effects simultaneously disentangling purifies the effect of each anomaly affording a clearer picture of which anomalies are “real” and which are merely proxies for other effectswhile pure payoffs may be smaller than the naïve payoffs of univariate analyses given the independent nature of the pure effects and the proxying behavior of the naïve effects their statistical significance is often greater the residual reversal effect is an exception emerging stronger in magnitude in its pure form than its naïve form primarily because the pure measure separates out related effects such as earnings surprise some effects including cash flowprice disappear completely in their pure form and both naïve and pure returns to beta prove inconsequential in explaining cumulative returnsthe strength and persistence of returns to such anomaly measures as trends in analysts’ earnings estimates represent evidence against semistrong market efficiency the significant payoffs to

management including the scope of the security selectionportfolio engineering problem the goal of portfolio management and the place of an individual portfolio within the investors overall investment scheme our process considers a wide range of return predictors designed to capture economic and behavioral effects as well as companyspecific information and events but the power of these predictors can differ across different types of stock the selection process must thus include breadth in terms of coverage of stocks as well as return predictors this does not mean that one should ignore the very real differences in price behavior that distinguish particular market subsets or that one cannot choose to focus on a particular subset such as value growth or smallcapitalization stocks it simply means that the model used for analyzing individual stocks should incorporate all information available from a broad universe of stocks “engineering portfolios a unified approach” which appeared as the lead article in a special technology issue of the journal of investing discusses the many benefits of taking a broad unified approach to the investment problem such an approach offers a coherent framework for analysis one in which each stock in the universe has one and only one alpha and in which each can be related to every other stock in the universe a unified approach can also take advantage of more information than a narrower view of the market can provide of practical importance is the fact that a broad unified approach allows the investment manager to “engineer” portfolios designed to outperform various clientspecified mandates  a broad unified approach combined with the power of a security selection system based on an appropriate multivariate analysis of a large number of return predictors allows for numerous insights into profit opportunities and improves the goodness of those insights this in turn can lead to more consistent portfolio performance the process of translating the insights into the performance is the process of portfolio engineering  a portfolio optimization process that is customized to include exactly the same dimensions found relevant by the stock selection process helps to ensure that all the opportunities detected by the modeling process are exploited while all the risks detected are accounted for and controlled the aim of portfolio engineering should be to provide the maximum possible expected return for the desired level of risk “residual risk how much is too much” considers the portfolio engineering problem within the broader context of the investors risk policy in particular it demonstrates that the investor must factor into the portfolio selection decision the level of manager skill—the managers ability to

using short positions in conjunction with long positions in a portfolio framework we soon realized the real benefits of this approach emerge only if one employs a single “integrated optimization” that considers long positions and short positions simultaneously in this framework longshort is not a twoportfolio strategy in which a portfolio of longs is somehow combined with a separately optimized portfolio of shorts rather it is a oneportfolio strategy in which the long and short positions are determined jointly within an optimization that takes into account the expected returns of the individual securities the standard deviation of those returns and the correlations between them as well as the investors tolerance for risk only with an integrated optimization is a longshort portfolio not constrained by benchmark weights the ensuing benefits are described in “longshort management an integrated approach” this article along with “on the optimality of longshort strategies” describes the conditions under which a dollar or betaneutral portfolio is optimal portfolios with both long and short positions however present a problem when it comes to optimization we examined this problem closely most recently in “trimability and fast optimization of longshort portfolios” our research indicates that the same algorithms used for optimizing longonly portfolios can be used unchanged for portfolios that contain short positions—provided a certain condition holds this condition which we term “trimability” usually holds in practice another issue that arises with regard to portfolios with short positions is the leverage involved leverage whether in longshort portfolios or in portfolios with leveraged long positions introduces risks that are distinct from the risk captured by a volatility measure these include the possibility of losses beyond the capital invested and the potential for margin calls which may necessitate forced selling perhaps at adverse prices these risks are not reflected in traditional meanvariance analysis which considers only volatility risk and can lead to portfolios with very high leverage levels in “traditional optimization is not optimal for leverageaverse investors” we propose that leverage aversion be included as an explicit term along with volatility aversion in the optimization of leveraged portfolios this results in a meanvarianceleverage optimization model using enhanced active longshort equity portfolios as an example we demonstrate that the meanvarianceleverage model shows that optimal portfolios will have

beginning with the original blackscholesmerton model for some purposes it may be sufficient to assume that prices follow a continuoustime process often however it is necessary to look more closely to determine how prices actually evolve investment actions themselves may change the price process certain investment strategies for example can have feedback effects consider momentum trading which tends to exacerbate trends in prices momentum traders helped to fuel the stock markets rise in the late s changing the price process in ways that a continuoustime model would have had difficulty predicting by contrast a model that incorporated the actual trading rules of major market participants at that time might have been able to forecast the growing technology stock bubble for a description of momentum trading’s effects on markets see bruce jacobs “momentum trading the new alchemy” the jacobs levy markowitz simulator “jlmsim” developed by bruce jacobs ken levy and harry markowitz is an asynchronous discretetime model that allows its users to model financial markets employing their own inputs about the numbers and types of investors traders and securities it does not assume that a process changes continuously over time instead it assumes that changes reflect events which unfold in an irregular fashion prices may thus be discontinuous gapping up or down the jlmsim can be used to detect how prices might change as the result of changes in financial market regulations or even something more subtle such as a change in the composition of market participants asynchronous models may also be superior when the question to be analyzed is whether microtheories about the behavior of investors add up to the observed macrophenomena of the market from time to time the market manifests liquidity “black holes” which seem to defy rational investor behavior consider the stock market crash on october   that day prices fell precipitously and discontinuously while one might have expected rational value investors to step in to pick up bargain stocks few did similar black holes developed in connection with the collapse of the hedge fund longterm capital management in  and more recently during the  credit crisis in these and other less extreme cases the price process was not fixed continuoustime modeling that assumes a fixed price process would have provided misleading results whereas asynchronous models may be able to explain both the abundance of sellers and the dearth of buyers for detailed descriptions of such events see bruce i jacobs capital ideas and market realities option replication investor behavior and stock market crashes “risk avoidance and market fragility” and “tumbling tower of babel subprime securitization and the credit crisis”  it is important to recognize that large traders may not be mere pricetakers they can affect prices we believe an asynchronoustime market simulator such as jlmsim which is capable of modeling the agents and market mechanisms behind observed prices is much better equipped than continuoustime models to capture this reality of markets for this reason we believe the jlmsim will stimulate much future

discretetime models whose clocks advance in irregular intervals from one event to the next can provide information that the more commonly used continuoustime models cannot they can be used for example to test the effects on security prices of realworld events such as changes in investors’ strategies modifications in overall leverage or switches in regulatory regimes the present paper uses an asynchronous discretetime model to demonstrate the effects on market prices of different ways of estimating security returns and of different trading rules in particular it shows how variations in the ratio of momentumtype investors to valuetype investors can have dramatic effects on security prices when the ratio of momentum to value investors is large security prices tend to “explode” when the ratio is low prices fluctuate rather realistically but do not destabilize security prices can also become unstable when traders in a thin market do not use trading rules that “anchor” their bids and

credit crisis of  and ensuing economic malaise sprang from the collapse of a tower of structured finance products based on subprime mortgage loans the relatively high returns on structured products created demand for them which helped fuel mortgage lending facilitating more purchases of homes and in turn putting upward pressure on prices this dynamic was abetted by the seeming safety of the products which encouraged leverage in lender and investor balance sheets as lenders exhausted the pool of possible homebuyers however housing prices began to decline in many parts of the us the downside risk of housingmarket prices became manifest as the systematic risk of housingprice losses was shifted to lenders and investors the solvency of some of the institutions that had built the tower of structured products came into question the real risk of subprime mortgage investing blew up financial firms and in turn economies worldwide bruce jacobs describes this process in “tumbling tower of babel subprime securitization and the credit crisis”  products designed to reduce risk for mortgage lenders and investors in mortgagerelated products ended up creating huge risks for the system as a whole the past quarter century has witnessed multiple versions of this same story played out by various financial actors in the s a strategy known as portfolio insurance based on thennew theories of option pricing purported to reduce the downside risks of equity investing while preserving upside potential in essence portfolio insurance aimed to create an optionlike put on equity holdings via a trading strategy that called for selling stock as stock prices declined and buying stock as stock prices rose this mechanistic trading contributed to the crash of october   as jacobs outlines in “option theory and its unintended consequences”  in his book capital ideas and market realities jacobs details the role played by portfolio insurance in the  crash and goes on to discuss subsequent crises caused or exacerbated by similar or related strategies these include actual options when popular demand for puts forces option dealers to engage in the same type of mechanistic trading required by portfolio insurance and less intuitively the type of arbitrage trades made by hedge funds such as longterm capital management ltcm’s trades were theoretically so low risk that leverage of  to  times capital was required to get the fund’s risk levels up to the desired equity market level yet these highly leveraged supposedly lowrisk and globally diversified strategies all fell apart at the same time when turmoil set off by russia’s de facto default stampeded investors toward safety and liquidity then the need to unwind arbitrage positions created the same trading patterns as portfolio insurance—selling into down markets and buying into rising markets jacobs focuses on this phenomenon in “when seemingly infallible arbitrage strategies fail” and “a tale of two hedge funds”   capital ideas and market realities “a tale of two hedge funds” and “tumbling tower of babel” also discuss how leverage helped to ignite and then spread the fires in the ltcm and  crises the risks of leverage are too often ignored modern portfolio theory for example focuses on volatility risk but has little to say about the risks of leverage other than its contribution to volatility reliance on conventional optimization techniques can thus give rise to portfolios that are highly leveraged the articles in the section “optimization short sales and leverage aversion” describe the unique risks of leverage and offer a possible solution in the form of a meanvarianceleverage optimization model that incorporates investor leverage aversion  another common thread of these crises is the seemingly general lack of appreciation for the difference between risk sharing and risk shifting jacobs’s “risk avoidance and market fragility” discusses these differences risksharing can reduce risk as diversification of the specific risks within a portfolio reduces overall portfolio risk but riskshifting merely moves risk from one party to another risk shifting tends to reduce investors’ perceptions of the risks they are incurring thereby encouraging more risktaking overall risk in the system however remains and increases as investors take on more risk eventually markets become

portfolio for your investing goals  this new edition of equity management reflects  years of research and investment practice by two pioneers of quantitative equity investing in the s bruce jacobs and ken levy published in peerreviewed journals a series of articles on detecting and exploiting the factors that significantly influence stock returns since then they have examined short selling in the context of longshort portfolios optimization of portfolios with short sales or other leveraged positions markets in crisis and models that can simulate realistic market behavior equity management the art and science of modern quantitative investing includes the classic  articles from the original edition plus  articles that were published since the first edition appeared together they present a compelling argument for the benefits of a quantitative approach in a complex multidimensional and dynamic factor world the chapters are grouped into eight parts with introductory material that places each section within the broader context of the investment body of knowledge part  examines the intricacies of stock price behavior and focuses on detecting the characteristics or factors behind them security prices are neither efficient nor random and unpredictable rather the market is a complex system permeated by a web of return regularities these regularities must be “disentangled” to arrive at the real sources of return this requires analyzing numerous promising returnpredictor relationships simultaneously part  looks at how best to exploit the investment opportunities detected the chapters outline a holistic approach that is multidimensional and dynamic viewing the market as integrated allows for greater breadth of investigation and greater depth of analysis hence enhances the potential for more and better insights a dynamic multidimensional proprietary approach that can adapt to changes in the underlying environment is better poised to capture opportunities than an approach that restricts itself to a small number of wellknown and static factors part  examines how short sales can expand investment opportunities and improve performance balancing long and short positions within a portfolio creates a marketneutral portfolio whose performance should reflect the returns and risks of the constituent securities but not the performance of the overall market the return from security selection can be transported to virtually any asset class via derivatives allowing the investor to take advantage of manager skill wherever it lies while maintaining any desired asset allocation part  focuses on another longshort approach—enhanced active equity or  type portfolios these portfolios retain full exposure to the market return while pursuing excess returns via short positions and leveraged long positions the development of  type portfolios was motivated by jacobs and levy’s research into optimization of longshort portfolios which showed that the optimization process should consider long positions short positions and any benchmark holding simultaneously the authors also tackled a problem that arises when optimizing portfolios that contain both long and short positions as the chapters in part  explain the factor or scenario models of covariance that simplify the optimization process for longonly portfolios do not necessarily apply to longshort portfolios jacobs and levy working with harry markowitz provide a solution they call “trimability” part  addresses the unique risks of leverage which are distinct from the risk captured by standard deviation or volatility most notable is the risk that a margin call can force the unwinding of positions the meanvariance model central to modern portfolio theory does not consider these unique risks and can thus lead to “optimal” portfolios with very high leverage the authors present an alternative model—meanvarianceleverage optimization—that allows an investor who is both volatilityaverse and leverageaverse to assess the utility of a portfolio high levels of leverage almost led to the demise of hedge fund longterm capital management in  and to the disruption of the entire financial system in  part  examines these episodes and other periods of market crisis including the  stock market crash one conclusion is that products and strategies that promise increased returns at reduced risk have attracted investors encouraged leverage and too often precipitated not only their own demise but also the nearcollapse of the global economy part  presents work undertaken with harry markowitz on a model for simulating market behavior the jacobs levy markowitz market simulator jlmsim allows users to create their own market models from the bottom up by specifying the numbers and types of market entities including portfolio analysts traders and investors as well as their decision rules the results so far suggest that types of investors value versus momentum as well as trading rules can have significant impacts on market stability foreword to the first edition by harry m markowitz foreword to the second edition by harry m markowitz preface to the second edition

princeton university department of operations research and financial engineering and editor the journal of portfolio management “despite the stock market’s highly competitive and efficient nature there are inefficiencies that can be harvested these inefficiencies however are not just lying around for the taking it takes a great deal of effort and discipline to tease them out of the market disentangle them from one another separate them from all the noise and understand their dynamic nature it has been my honor to work with bruce jacobs and ken levy for nearly  years over this time i

regularities new insights and investment opportunities’ their work has stood the test of time and continues to be relevant today a wide audience of academics practitioners and students will benefit from the accumulated wisdom in this collection of their articles” michael gibbons deputy dean i w burnham professor of investment banking the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania “while academics fought to convince themselves and others that capital market prices could be explained by a simplified paradigm driven by a few factors bruce jacobs and ken levy forged ahead against the academic and practitioner trend by embracing the market’s complexity their pioneering work on the multidimensional nature of stock returns was decades ahead of its time the current relevance of their work demonstrates its innovation durability and importance in this edition they share the deep and practical insights gained by rich experience and tireless intellectual curiosity walking us through the equity investment process and challenging along the way many of the investing fads of the past few decades their work should be required reading for anyone learning about engaging in or evaluating

this impressive collection of their research articles provides important insights into a broad assortment of topics ranging from security analysis to portfolio construction techniques this book should be part of the library of academics and practitioners alike” a craig mackinlay joseph p wargrove professor of finance the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania “i made the work of jacobs and levy required reading for my portfolio management class and if still teaching would continue to do so their work combines rigorous academic research with valuable insights into the real world of investment practice one of their many insights is that an optimized combination of long and short positions is well suited to exploit relative security valuations because many investors cannot act on negative information by selling short there are more opportunities for shorts for those who can sell short and who know how to integrate their short positions with their long positions that is a major advantage equity management should be on the bookshelf of every serious student of the stock market today” edward m miller professor of economics and finance university of new orleans “while factor investing is today in the mainstream of portfolio management understanding and successfully executing on multidimensional exposures is nuanced that is the main point of this excellently written book the authors powerfully lay out how factor opportunities are driven by patterns of investor demand which means that factor identification is necessarily a dynamic process and factor returns and risks are not stationary this is an important book for anyone concerned with alpha generation and portfolio construction” andré perold george gund professor of finance and banking emeritus harvard university “bruce jacobs and ken levy walk us through their year legacy of important insightful and frequently cuttingedge research articles the accompanying commentary places this research in financial history from the early days of quant equity management through the rise of hedge funds from the rise of leverage through the systemic risks that have wreaked havoc across the globe this book

and the contributions the authors have made to that foundationbruce jacobss and ken levys insights into stock price behavior and investment management have been featured at professional forums including the cfa institutes formerly association for investment management and research annual conference the institute of chartered financial analysts continuing education seminars the institute for quantitative research in finance the new york society of security analysts the society of quantitative analysts and the berkeley program in finance their views and strategies have been featured in the pages of the wall street journal investors business daily institutional investor and pensions  investments bruce jacobs and ken levy have long been recognized as pioneers in quantitative equity management in the s they began to publish a series of articles in the peerreviewed financial analysts journal journal of portfolio management and journal of investing these articles were based on the authors own research into and experience with detecting and exploiting the recurring profit opportunities available in a supposedly efficient marketplace together they outline an approach for selecting stocks and constructing portfolios that has the potential to deliver superior returns over timeequity management collects  of these articles from s disentangling equity return regularities through s alpha transport with derivatives these are grouped into three parts that cover the range of jacobs and levys investment philosophy and strategy from selecting securities to engineering portfolios to expanding opportunities with short selling and derivatives new introductory material provides a perspective on the articles placing each within the broader context of the investment body of knowledgethe authors approach to security selection begins with the concept of a complex market in their view us security prices are not efficient nor random and unpredictable neither however is the market a simple system simple rules such as buy low pe or buy value will not be able to yield consistent investment profits rather a complex market is permeated by a web of return regularities furthermore these regularities are interrelated and must be disentangled in order to arrive at real sources of return disentangling requires analyzing multiple promising returnpredictor relationships simultaneously the resulting pure estimated returns are additive and more robust than those from simpler onefactor analysesthe breadth of returnpredictors considered in the security selection process as well as the depth of analysis help to capture the complexity of market pricing but predictors can differ across different types of stocks this dimension of complexity is best captured by viewing the broadest possible range of stocks through a wideangle analytical lens this is the case when the model used for analyzing individual stocks incorporates all the information available from the broad universe of stocks this approach offers a coherent framework for analysis and is poised to take advantage of more information than a narrower view of the market one focusing on particular styles or segments for example might providemaximizing the opportunities detected in the security selection process requires a disciplined approach to portfolio construction quantitative techniques such as optimization are best suited to ensuring that opportunities are maximized while risks are controlled proprietary portfolio optimization in which the portfolio is optimized along the same dimensions that are considered in the security selection process can further enhance portfolio performanceallowing for short sales expands investment opportunities hence has the potential to improve performance when long and short positions are balanced the resulting portfolio is market neutral its performance should reflect the returns and risks of the individual constituent securities but not the performance of the market from which those securities were selected long and short positions are best determined in a single integrated optimization this frees the portfolio from benchmark weight constraints and allows it more flexibility in the pursuit of return and control of riska longshort portfolio reflects the ability of the manager to select securities the alpha or excess return from this security selection can be transported along with its associated risk to virtually any desired asset class via the purchase of derivatives on that asset class the investor can thus take advantage of manager skill wherever it lies while maintaining an asset allocation that would not ordinarily encompass the securities exploited by the skilled managertogether the articles in equity management

“anomalies” which taken together can be used to build a successful stock selection and portfolio construction process jacobs and levy make a very strong case both in their research and in their practice for their proposition that by combining many factors each of which may be individually too weak to base stock selection upon a successful “quant” strategy can be developed every advanced

about market neutral equity strategies since  market neutral strategies provides a forum in which they and some of the industrys other leading market neutral practitioners discuss the implementation the benefits and the risks of market neutral investing the discussion is directed toward institutional investors sophisticated individual investors and investment consultants who seek a deeper understanding of how these strategies can contribute to the pursuit of investment return and the control of investment risk in general market neutral strategies seek to profit from detecting perceived mispricings in individual securities and constructing portfolios that deliver the excess return and risk associated with those securities regardless of underlying market moves this is accomplished by holding balanced long and short positions in various securities andor by holding these securities in conjunction with long or short positions in derivatives securities so that the overall portfolios exposure to primary risk factors such as equity market and interest rate risks is neutralized market neutral investing employs the same instruments as more conventional strategies although it tends to

market neutral portfolios with national debt securities one involves bond futures and the other interest rate swaps among the more complicated and esoteric market neutral strategies is mortgage arbitrage market neutral strategies with mortgagebacked securities by george e hall of the clinton group and seth c fischoff gets into the meat and potatoes of these portfolios including such issues as how to deal with prepayment risk and burnout daniel s och of ochziff capital management and todd c pulvino of northwestern universitys kellogg school of management in their chapter merger arbitrage show how merger arbitragers can reap an insurance premium by taking on the risk of merger failures additional chapters cover areas of general concern jane buchan joins editors bruce jacobs and ken levy to answer some common questions in questions and answers about market neutral investing for instance can neutrality be achieved by combining a portfolio holding long positions with one holding short positions arent short positions inherently riskier than long positions should an investor use a single manager or multiple managers to best exploit market neutral strategies in transporting alpha bruce jacobs and ken levy show how the excess alpha return from a market neutral strategy can be combined with the systematic return on virtually any asset class offering plan sponsors and investment managers the ability to optimize the returns from both asset allocation and security selection bruce jacobs and ken levy go on to examine two notorious market neutral failures dissecting the cases of askin capital management a firm that specialized in mortgage arbitrage and longterm capital management which dealt in sovereign fixedincome merger arbitrage and equity option and longshort trading these two cases provide some object lessons for investors considering market neutral managers investors and managers alike may gain much needed insight into the taxation of market neutral investing from significant tax considerations for taxable investors in market neutral strategies by peter e pront and john e tavss of seward  kissel seward  kissels peter pront and s john ryan follow up with a look at some tax and legal concerns for taxexempt investors in market neutral strategies in taxexempt organizations and other special categories of investors their potential contribution to overall fund diversification has been one of the primary selling points for market neutral strategies these strategies have much to offer beyond diversification however they can be used for example to exploit opportunities in markets that might otherwise be considered too risky for suitable investment they can allow investors to finetune portfolio risk exposures they can also be used to enhance return the ability to sell short for example allows the investor to seek out opportunities in overvalued securities as well as undervalued ones and one of the major advantages of market neutral construction is that it allows the investor to extract the return available from selecting securities in one asset class and by using derivatives to transport that return to an entirely different asset class allowing the investor to reap the rewards of both individual security selection and asset class selection foreword mark anson phd chief investment officer calpers chapter

reality began to reassert itself in the fall of  prices began to fall insured investors flooded the market with sell orders turning what might have been a modest correction into a crash even greater than the great crash of cimr grew out of papers i had written in the s describing how portfolio insurance could fail to deliver on its promises and even destabilize the broad market these had been submitted to several journals including financial analysts journal faj where they had been reviewed by mark rubinstein rubinstein a member of the journals’ editorial boards was also a cofounder of leland obrien rubinstein associates lor which managed over  billion in portfolio insurance assets at the time of the crash on the bases of his reviews the journals declined to publish my submissionsgiven this history i was very pleasantly surprised to see a quite favorable review of cimr in the julyaugust  issue of faj book review editor martin fridson stated “jacobs’s meticulously documented book presents compelling evidence    that portfolio insurance failed to deliver on its lofty promises” in the januaryfebruary  issue of faj however fridson published an unprecedented postscript to this review in an abrupt aboutface the “postscript” charged that i “marshaled selected quotations to suggest that promotions in the early s by leland obrien rubinstein associates lor led investors to believe that its portfolio insurance product placed an absolute floor under their potential returns” on the contrary he asserts on the basis of various unnamed sources “lors pre presentations were candid in describing the likely impact on the strategy of greaterthanexpected market volatility”i was allowed a brief response to the charges in fridsons “postscript” in the mayjune  issue of faj “postscript authors comment” my original reply “the marketing of portfolio insurance and the magnification of market risk the whole story” had to be cut substantially in order to meet the faj’s space constraints space in that same issue was nevertheless available to afford yet another comment from fridson “postscript reviewer’s response” fridson essentially concluded that “sophisticated investors who knew the right questions to ask would not have been misled” by lors marketingyet the latter statement is directly antithetical to securities law section  of the investment advisers act of  holds that “caveat emptor” is not an adequate standard of disclosure for investment professionals and the us supreme court decision in sec v capital gains research bureau inc  explains why full and forthright disclosure is required to protect investors from the type of abuses that led to the great crash of  i pointed this out in a letter to the editor “response to fridson’s ‘postscript reviewer’s response’” which faj editor gifford fong declined to publishin june of  pensions  investments pi published an article “praise for book turns to criticism” in which rubinstein admitted that it was he who had “suggested” to fridson that fridson write a “correction” of his original review of cimr contrary to fridsons assertion in “postscript reviewers response” that his anonymous sources “had no obvious reason either to attack jacobs or defend lor”  faj editor fong asserts in this article apparently unaware of rubinsteins admission “if there was pressure from someone on the editorial board i would see that person would not be on the board” fong nevertheless claimed in a followup article in pi “rubinstein to stay on editorial board of faj despite talking with fridson” that “the real question is was mark acting in his capacity as an editorial board member” rubinstein was not dismissedin the fall of  i posted an “open letter to aimr and the financial analysts journal” which documented apparent violations by certain members of the faj editorial board of all five professional conduct standards of the association of investment management and research since renamed the cfa institute this letter also documented violations of securities law and aimr standards by lor including its marketing of portfolio insurance as a “guaranteed equity investment” and its failures to adequately disclose the risks of the strategy the ethical issues involved including aimr’s tacit endorsement of a caveat emptor standard of disclosure and the conflicts of interest underlying faj’s editorial process were further discussed in a series of letters published in pi in the fall of a little less than a year later in july  aimr publicly proposed a set of research objectivity standards for buy and sellside analysts their firms issuing corporations and the media designed to curb conflictofinterest problems in the investment industry my response “bruce jacobs comments on aimrs proposed research objectivity standards recommending that aimr adopt such standards for its own publications” called on aimr to put their own house in order by instituting conflictofinterest and other standards for their own publications this recommendation was picked up by the wall street journal “bids  offers analyst heal thyself” and supported by letters from several aimr member societies this support was noted in an editorial in global investor which concluded that “the spirit of full transparency and objectivity has not been well served” by aimr in its handling of this mattersoon afterward aimr issued a press release “aimr announces new faj editor and new conflictofinterest policies” announcing that it had completed a review of faj’s standards policies and practices and found them in compliance with “best practice” and in keeping with aimrs code and standards the release went on to state that the ethical obligations and conflictofinterest policies governing faj would be published in an upcoming issue it also announced the appointment of a new editor for faj somewhat surprisingly aimr had not formally announced the departure of fong although pi had reported itin view of aimr’s newfound interest in setting conflictofinterest standards for itself and others i submitted to faj a letter to the editor “investment advisory disclosure standards and financial analysts journal conflictofinterest policies” setting forth violations of aimr conflictofinterest and other standards at faj in a cover letter to the aimr board i pointed out that publication of the letter would benefit readers by clarifying the standards of disclosure investment professionals are required to abide by and benefit aimr and faj by allowing faj to proceed with a clean slate under its new editor and newly announced policies aimr’s general counsel later informed me that the letter would not be published in “aimr and ‘best practices’ on ethics” pi december   however i question whether faj will opt for transparency and objectivity given its history and suggest that aimr take a page from the medical journals which provide for a full airing of questionable acts via letters and editorial commentary should faj accept anything less than this as “best practice”the whole debate revolving around faj going back to my original submission to the journal in the s raises extremely troubling questions about the conduct of the faj’s editor and members of its editorial board in addition it raises questions about the aimr’s supervision of faj and its willingness or ability to hold its officials and staff to the same high standards demanded of its members what level of disclosure on the part of investment advisers and managers would aimr desire to see promulgated in its own publications what standards of behavior would aimr expect its officials and staff to followin january  aimr finally published the conflictofinterest policies governing faj aimr is to be applauded for creating and disclosing these standards and it is to be hoped that they will go a long way toward mitigating the pernicious effects of conflicts of interest however aimr could have aimed

be published in financial analysts journal faj although his “comments and suggestions on conflicts and the appearance of conflicts are thoughtful and are being considered by aimr and the journal editor” the following issues thus remain outstanding faj has never disclosed the conflicted roles mark rubinstein played both in rejecting manuscripts about portfolio insurance in the s and in influencing the book review process in  despite aimr’s assertion that “sunlight is the best disinfectant” when it comes to conflicts of interest “aimr recommends  ‘new year’s resolutions’ for

sufficient in size to threaten market stability jacobs further notes that in contrast to the anonymous “sources” fridson uses to support his claims cimr provides extensive quotations from and

levy equity management has conducted over  years of stateoftheart research in security pricing portfolio construction and sophisticated trading techniques our groundbreaking work on disentangling return regularities engineering portfolios to performance benchmarks and longshort investing including integrated longshort optimization and portfolio optimization with leverage aversion has been featured at professional forums such as the cfa institute and qgroup wall street conferences such as morgan stanley and goldman sachs academic conferences such as university of california berkeley and the wharton school university of pennsylvania and in the pages of institutional investor and the wall street journal our research helped to change the course of modern investment management by demonstrating that the supposedly efficient equity market offered potential profit opportunities that could be identified and exploited in the s jacobs and levy began to publish a series of articles articulating the investment philosophy that had emerged from their research these articles appeared in the peerreviewed financial analysts journal journal of portfolio management journal of investing operations research and journal of financial perspectives our seminal insight is that equity market returns are driven by complex combinations of company fundamentals macroeconomic conditions and behavioral factors and that these effects can be detected with the use of extensive modeling grounded in intuitive and theoretically plausible relationships exploiting these relationships requires simultaneous analysis of numerous variables across a broad and diverse range of stocks portfolio optimization and performance attribution systems that are customized to the security selection process sophisticated trading techniques and creative researcharticlessecurity selection the articles abstracted here address jacobs levy equity management’s view of the market as a complex system and some of the methods that can best be used to “disentangle” this complexity us equity market returns are driven by complex combinations of company fundamentals such as earnings and growth rates macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and inflation and behavioral factors such as investors’ tendency to overreact to news and events as a result the market is permeated by a complex web of interrelated return regularities disentangling this web allows potentially profitable investment opportunities to emerge “the complexity of the stock market” first appeared in the th anniversary issue of the journal of portfolio management and was selected for inclusion in streetwise the best of the journal of portfolio management this article demonstrates that active quantitative investing despite the assertions of the efficient market theorists and random walk advocates is not a futile task at the same time it explains why simple investment techniques such as buying lowpe stocks cannot provide consistent outperformance identifying the complex web of interrelationships that underlie stock price movements and exploiting them for profitable investing requires extensive computerbased statistical modeling copyright  association for investment management and research reproduced and republished from financial analysts journal with permission all rights reserved disentangling equity return regularities new insights and investment opportunities by bruce i jacobs and kenneth n levy financial analysts journal mayjune  robust insights into stock price behavior emerge only from an analysis that carefully considers numerous factors simultaneously naïve attempts to relate returns and potential return predictors do not take correlation into account quintiling or univariate

anomaly research has focused on one or two return regularities at a time this seminal article demonstrates that multivariate regression can provide a unified framework for “disentangling” and analyzing numerous return effects simultaneously disentangling purifies the effect of each anomaly affording a clearer picture of which anomalies are “real” and which are merely proxies for other effectswhile pure payoffs may be smaller than the naïve payoffs of univariate analyses given the independent nature of the pure effects and the proxying behavior of the naïve effects their statistical significance is often greater the residual reversal effect is an exception emerging stronger in magnitude in its pure form than its naïve form primarily because the pure measure separates out related effects such as earnings surprise some effects including cash flowprice disappear completely in their pure form and both naïve and pure returns to beta prove inconsequential in explaining cumulative returnsthe strength and persistence of returns to such anomaly measures as trends in analysts’ earnings estimates represent evidence against semistrong market efficiency the significant payoffs to

scheme our process considers a wide range of return predictors designed to capture economic and behavioral effects as well as companyspecific information and events but the power of these predictors can differ across different types of stock the selection process must thus include breadth in terms of coverage of stocks as well as return predictors this does not mean that one should ignore the very real differences in price behavior that distinguish particular market subsets or that one cannot choose to focus on a particular subset such as value growth or smallcapitalization stocks it simply means that the model used for analyzing individual stocks should incorporate all information available from a broad universe of stocks “engineering portfolios a unified approach” which appeared as the lead article in a special technology issue of the journal of investing discusses the many benefits of taking a broad unified approach to the investment problem such an approach offers a coherent framework for analysis one in which each stock in the universe has one and only one alpha and in which each can be related to every other stock in the universe a unified approach can also take advantage of more information than a narrower view of the market can provide of practical importance is the fact that a broad unified approach allows the investment manager to “engineer” portfolios designed to outperform various clientspecified mandates  a broad unified approach combined with the power of a security selection system based on an appropriate multivariate analysis of a large number of return predictors allows for numerous insights into profit opportunities and improves the goodness of those insights this in turn can lead to more consistent portfolio performance the process of translating the insights into the performance is the process of portfolio engineering  a portfolio optimization process that is customized to include exactly the same dimensions found relevant by the stock selection process helps to ensure that all the opportunities detected by the modeling process are exploited while all the risks detected are accounted for and controlled the aim of portfolio engineering should be to provide the maximum possible expected return for the desired level of risk “residual risk how much is too much” considers the portfolio engineering problem within the broader context of the investors risk policy in particular it demonstrates that the investor must factor into the portfolio selection decision the level of manager skill—the managers ability to

describes the conditions under which a dollar or betaneutral portfolio is optimal portfolios with both long and short positions however present a problem when it comes to optimization we examined this problem closely most recently in “trimability and fast optimization of longshort portfolios” our research indicates that the same algorithms used for optimizing longonly portfolios can be used unchanged for portfolios that contain short positions—provided a certain condition holds this condition which we term “trimability” usually holds in practice another issue that arises with regard to portfolios with short positions is the leverage involved leverage whether in longshort portfolios or in portfolios with leveraged long positions introduces risks that are distinct from the risk captured by a volatility measure these include the possibility of losses beyond the capital invested and the potential for margin calls which may necessitate forced selling perhaps at adverse prices these risks are not reflected in traditional meanvariance analysis which considers only volatility risk and can lead to portfolios with very high leverage levels in “traditional optimization is not optimal for leverageaverse investors” we propose that leverage aversion be included as an explicit term along with volatility aversion in the optimization of leveraged portfolios this results in a meanvarianceleverage optimization model using enhanced active longshort equity portfolios as an example we demonstrate that the meanvarianceleverage model shows that optimal portfolios will have modest levels of leverage  for instance for realistic levels of leverage aversion meanvarianceleverage optimization selects the portfolio offering the greatest utility for a leverageaverse investor

beginning with the original blackscholesmerton model for some purposes it may be sufficient to assume that prices follow a continuoustime process often however it is necessary to look more closely to determine how prices actually evolve investment actions themselves may change the price process certain investment strategies for example can have feedback effects consider momentum trading which tends to exacerbate trends in prices momentum traders helped to fuel the stock markets rise in the late s changing the price process in ways that a continuoustime model would have had difficulty predicting by contrast a model that incorporated the actual trading rules of major market participants at that time might have been able to forecast the growing technology stock bubble for a description of momentum trading’s effects on markets see bruce jacobs “momentum trading the new alchemy” the jacobs levy markowitz simulator “jlmsim” developed by bruce jacobs ken levy and harry markowitz is an asynchronous discretetime model that allows its users to model financial markets employing their own inputs about the numbers and types of investors traders and securities it does not assume that a process changes continuously over time instead it assumes that changes reflect events which unfold in an irregular fashion prices may thus be discontinuous gapping up or down the jlmsim can be used to detect how prices might change as the result of changes in financial market regulations or even something more subtle such as a change in the composition of market participants asynchronous models may also be superior when the question to be analyzed is whether microtheories about the behavior of investors add up to the observed macrophenomena of the market from time to time the market manifests liquidity “black holes” which seem to defy rational investor behavior consider the stock market crash on october   that day prices fell precipitously and discontinuously while one might have expected rational value investors to step in to pick up bargain stocks few did similar black holes developed in connection with the collapse of the hedge fund longterm capital management in  and more recently during the  credit crisis in these and other less extreme cases the price process was not fixed continuoustime modeling that assumes a fixed price process would have provided misleading results whereas asynchronous models may be able to explain both the abundance of sellers and the dearth of buyers for detailed descriptions of such events see bruce i jacobs capital ideas and market realities option replication investor behavior and stock market crashes “risk avoidance and market fragility” and “tumbling tower of babel subprime securitization and the credit crisis”  it is important to recognize that large traders may not be mere pricetakers they can affect prices we believe an asynchronoustime market simulator such as jlmsim which is capable of modeling the agents and market mechanisms behind observed prices is much better equipped than continuoustime models to capture this reality of markets for this reason we believe the jlmsim will stimulate much future research  key articles simulating security markets in dynamic and equilibrium modes by bruce i jacobs kenneth n levy and harry m markowitz financial analysts journal septemberoctober asynchronous discretetime models whose clocks advance in irregular intervals from one event to the next can provide information that the more commonly used continuoustime models cannot they can be used for example to test the effects on security prices of realworld events such as changes in investors’ strategies modifications in overall leverage or switches in regulatory regimes the present paper uses an asynchronous discretetime model to demonstrate the effects on market prices of different ways of estimating security returns and of different trading rules in particular it shows how variations in the ratio of momentumtype investors to valuetype investors can have dramatic effects on security prices when the ratio of momentum to value investors is large security prices tend to “explode” when the ratio is low prices fluctuate rather realistically but do not destabilize security prices can also become unstable when traders in a thin market do not use trading rules that “anchor” their bids and asks to recent market prices finally this paper demonstrates that an asynchronous discretetime model can be used to arrive at equilibrium expected returns for a variety of realistic financial markets

credit crisis of  and ensuing economic malaise sprang from the collapse of a tower of structured finance products based on subprime mortgage loans the relatively high returns on structured products created demand for them which helped fuel mortgage lending facilitating more purchases of homes and in turn putting upward pressure on prices this dynamic was abetted by the seeming safety of the products which encouraged leverage in lender and investor balance sheets as lenders exhausted the pool of possible homebuyers however housing prices began to decline in many parts of the us the downside risk of housingmarket prices became manifest as the systematic risk of housingprice losses was shifted to lenders and investors the solvency of some of the institutions that had built the tower of structured products came into question the real risk of subprime mortgage investing blew up financial firms and in turn economies worldwide bruce jacobs describes this process in “tumbling tower of babel subprime securitization and the credit crisis”  products designed to reduce risk for mortgage lenders and investors in mortgagerelated products ended up creating huge risks for the system as a whole the past quarter century has witnessed multiple versions of this same story played out by various financial actors in the s a strategy known as portfolio insurance based on thennew theories of option pricing purported to reduce the downside risks of equity investing while preserving upside potential in essence portfolio insurance aimed to create an optionlike put on equity holdings via a trading strategy that called for selling stock as stock prices declined and buying stock as stock prices rose this mechanistic trading contributed to the crash of october   as jacobs outlines in “option theory and its unintended consequences”  in his book capital ideas and market realities jacobs details the role played by portfolio insurance in the  crash and goes on to discuss subsequent crises caused or exacerbated by similar or related strategies these include actual options when popular demand for puts forces option dealers to engage in the same type of mechanistic trading required by portfolio insurance and less intuitively the type of arbitrage trades made by hedge funds such as longterm capital management ltcm’s trades were theoretically so low risk that leverage of  to  times capital was required to get the fund’s risk levels up to the desired equity market level yet these highly leveraged supposedly lowrisk and globally diversified strategies all fell apart at the same time when turmoil set off by russia’s de facto default stampeded investors toward safety and liquidity then the need to unwind arbitrage positions created the same trading patterns as portfolio insurance—selling into down markets and buying into rising markets jacobs focuses on this phenomenon in “when seemingly infallible arbitrage strategies fail” and “a tale of two hedge funds”   capital ideas and market realities “a tale of two hedge funds” and “tumbling tower of babel” also discuss how leverage helped to ignite and then spread the fires in the ltcm and  crises the risks of leverage are too often ignored modern portfolio theory for example focuses on volatility risk but has little to say about the risks of leverage other than its contribution to volatility reliance on conventional optimization techniques can thus give rise to portfolios that are highly leveraged the articles in the section “optimization short sales and leverage aversion” describe the unique risks of leverage and offer a possible solution in the form of a meanvarianceleverage optimization model that incorporates investor leverage aversion  another common thread of these crises is the seemingly general lack of appreciation for the difference between risk sharing and risk shifting jacobs’s “risk avoidance and market fragility” discusses these differences risksharing can reduce risk as diversification of the specific risks within a portfolio reduces overall portfolio risk but riskshifting merely moves risk from one party to another risk shifting tends to reduce investors’ perceptions of the risks they are incurring thereby encouraging more risktaking overall risk in the system however remains and increases as investors take on more risk eventually markets become

ken levy published in peerreviewed journals a series of articles on detecting and exploiting the factors that significantly influence stock returns since then they have examined short selling in the context of longshort portfolios optimization of portfolios with short sales or other leveraged positions markets in crisis and models that can simulate realistic market behavior equity management the art and science of modern quantitative investing includes the classic  articles from the original edition plus  articles that were published since the first edition appeared together they present a compelling argument for the benefits of a quantitative approach in a complex multidimensional and dynamic factor world the chapters are grouped into eight parts with introductory material that places each section within the broader context of the investment body of knowledge part  examines the intricacies of stock price behavior and focuses on detecting the characteristics or factors behind them security prices are neither efficient nor random and unpredictable rather the market is a complex system permeated by a web of return regularities these regularities must be “disentangled” to arrive at the real sources of return this requires analyzing numerous promising returnpredictor relationships simultaneously part  looks at how best to exploit the investment opportunities detected the chapters outline a holistic approach that is multidimensional and dynamic viewing the market as integrated allows for greater breadth of investigation and greater depth of analysis hence enhances the potential for more and better insights a dynamic multidimensional proprietary approach that can adapt to changes in the underlying environment is better poised to capture opportunities than an approach that restricts itself to a small number of wellknown and static factors part  examines how short sales can expand investment opportunities and improve performance balancing long and short positions within a portfolio creates a marketneutral portfolio whose performance should reflect the returns and risks of the constituent securities but not the performance of the overall market the return from security selection can be transported to virtually any asset class via derivatives allowing the investor to take advantage of manager skill wherever it lies while maintaining any desired asset allocation part  focuses on another longshort approach—enhanced active equity or  type portfolios these portfolios retain full exposure to the market return while pursuing excess returns via short positions and leveraged long positions the development of  type portfolios was motivated by jacobs and levy’s research into optimization of longshort portfolios which showed that the optimization process should consider long positions short positions and any benchmark holding simultaneously the authors also tackled a problem that arises when optimizing portfolios that contain both long and short positions as the chapters in part  explain the factor or scenario models of covariance that simplify the optimization process for longonly portfolios do not necessarily apply to longshort portfolios jacobs and levy working with harry markowitz provide a solution they call “trimability” part  addresses the unique risks of leverage which are distinct from the risk captured by standard deviation or volatility most notable is the risk that a margin call can force the unwinding of positions the meanvariance model central to modern portfolio theory does not consider these unique risks and can thus lead to “optimal” portfolios with very high leverage the authors present an alternative model—meanvarianceleverage optimization—that allows an investor who is both volatilityaverse and leverageaverse to assess the utility of a portfolio high levels of leverage almost led to the demise of hedge fund longterm capital management in  and to the disruption of the entire financial system in  part  examines these episodes and other periods of market crisis including the  stock market crash one conclusion is that products and strategies that promise increased returns at reduced risk have attracted investors encouraged leverage and too often precipitated not only their own demise but also the nearcollapse of the global economy part  presents work undertaken with harry markowitz on a model for simulating market behavior the jacobs levy markowitz market simulator jlmsim allows users to create their own market models from the bottom up by specifying the numbers and types of market entities including portfolio analysts traders and investors as well as their decision rules the results so far suggest that types of investors value versus momentum as well

there are inefficiencies that can be harvested these inefficiencies however are not just lying around for the taking it takes a great deal of effort and discipline to tease them out of the market disentangle them from one another separate them from all the noise and understand their dynamic nature it has been my honor to work with bruce jacobs and ken levy for nearly  years over this time i

regularities new insights and investment opportunities’ their work has stood the test of time and continues to be relevant today a wide audience of academics practitioners and students will benefit from the accumulated wisdom in this collection of their articles” michael gibbons deputy dean i w burnham professor of investment banking the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania “while academics fought to convince themselves and others that capital market prices could be explained by a simplified paradigm driven by a few factors bruce jacobs and ken levy forged ahead against the academic and practitioner trend by embracing the market’s complexity their pioneering work on the multidimensional nature of stock returns was decades ahead of its time the current relevance of their work demonstrates its innovation durability and importance in this edition they share the deep and practical insights gained by rich experience and tireless intellectual curiosity walking us through the equity investment process and challenging along the way many of the investing fads of the past few decades their work should be required reading for anyone learning about engaging in or evaluating

be part of the library of academics and practitioners alike” a craig mackinlay joseph p wargrove professor of finance the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania “i made the work of jacobs and levy required reading for my portfolio management class and if still teaching would continue to do so their work combines rigorous academic research with valuable insights into the real world of investment practice one of their many insights is that an optimized combination of long and short positions is well suited to exploit relative security valuations because many investors cannot act on negative information by selling short there are more opportunities for shorts for those who can sell short and who know how to integrate their short positions with their long positions that is a major advantage equity management should be on the bookshelf of every serious student of the stock market today” edward m miller professor of economics and finance university of new orleans “while factor investing is today in the mainstream of portfolio management understanding and successfully executing on multidimensional exposures is nuanced that is the main point of this excellently written book the authors powerfully lay out how factor opportunities are driven by patterns of investor demand which means that factor identification is necessarily a dynamic process and factor returns and risks are not stationary this is an important book for anyone concerned with alpha generation and portfolio construction” andré perold george gund professor of finance and banking emeritus harvard university “bruce jacobs and ken levy walk us through their year legacy of important insightful and frequently cuttingedge research articles the accompanying commentary places this research in

behavioral factors underlying stock returns form the basis of the firms unique multidimensional and dynamic approach to investingthis book brings together for the first time jacobs and levys groundbreaking articles from the industrys preeminent journals these introduce such key concepts as disentangling the sources of security returns engineering portfolios to performance benchmarks and longshort investing for exploiting both winning and losing stocks new introductory material provides a fascinating review of the concepts that form the foundation of modern active equity management and the contributions the authors have made to that foundationbruce jacobss and ken levys insights into stock price behavior and investment management have been featured at professional forums including the cfa institutes formerly association for investment management and research annual conference the institute of chartered financial analysts continuing education seminars the institute for quantitative research in finance the new york society of security analysts the society of quantitative analysts and the berkeley program in finance their views and strategies have been featured in the pages of the wall street journal investors business daily institutional investor and pensions  investments bruce jacobs and ken levy have long been recognized as pioneers in quantitative equity management in the s they began to publish a series of articles in the peerreviewed financial analysts journal journal of portfolio management and journal of investing these articles were based on the authors own research into and experience with detecting and exploiting the recurring profit opportunities available in a supposedly efficient marketplace together they outline an approach for selecting stocks and constructing portfolios that has the potential to deliver superior returns over timeequity management collects  of these articles from s disentangling equity return regularities through s alpha transport with derivatives these are grouped into three parts that cover the range of jacobs and levys investment philosophy and strategy from selecting securities to engineering portfolios to expanding opportunities with short selling and derivatives new introductory material provides a perspective on the articles placing each within the broader context of the investment body of knowledgethe authors approach to security selection begins with the concept of a complex market in their view us security prices are not efficient nor random and unpredictable neither however is the market a simple system simple rules such as buy low pe or buy value will not be able to yield consistent investment profits rather a complex market is permeated by a web of return regularities furthermore these regularities are interrelated and must be disentangled in order to arrive at real sources of return disentangling requires analyzing multiple promising returnpredictor relationships simultaneously the resulting pure estimated returns are additive and more robust than those from simpler onefactor analysesthe breadth of returnpredictors considered in the security selection process as well as the depth of analysis help to capture the complexity of market pricing but predictors can differ across different types of stocks this dimension of complexity is best captured by viewing the broadest possible range of stocks through a wideangle analytical lens this is the case when the model used for analyzing individual stocks incorporates all the information available from the broad universe of stocks this approach offers a coherent framework for analysis and is poised to take advantage of more information than a narrower view of the market one focusing on particular styles or segments for example might providemaximizing the opportunities detected in the security selection process requires a disciplined approach to portfolio construction quantitative techniques such as optimization are best suited to ensuring that opportunities are maximized while risks are controlled proprietary portfolio optimization in which the portfolio is optimized along the same dimensions that are considered in the security selection process can further enhance portfolio performanceallowing for short sales expands investment opportunities hence has the potential to improve performance when long and short positions are balanced the resulting portfolio is market neutral its performance should reflect the returns and risks of the individual constituent securities but not the performance of the market from which those securities were selected long and short positions are best determined in a single integrated optimization this frees the portfolio from benchmark weight constraints and allows it more flexibility in the pursuit of return and control of riska longshort portfolio reflects the ability of the manager to select securities the alpha or excess return from this security selection can be transported along with its associated risk to virtually any desired asset class via the purchase of derivatives on that asset class the investor can thus take advantage of manager skill wherever it lies while maintaining an asset allocation that would not ordinarily encompass the securities exploited by the skilled managertogether the articles in equity management

follow up with a look at some tax and legal concerns for taxexempt investors in market neutral strategies in taxexempt organizations and other special categories of investors their potential contribution to overall fund diversification has been one of the primary selling points for market neutral strategies these strategies have much to offer beyond diversification however they can be used for example to exploit opportunities in markets that might otherwise be considered too risky for suitable investment they can allow investors to finetune portfolio risk exposures they can also be used to enhance return the ability to sell short for example allows the investor to seek out opportunities in overvalued securities as well as undervalued ones and one of the major advantages of market neutral construction is that it allows the investor to extract the return available from selecting securities in one asset class and by using derivatives to transport that return to an entirely different asset class allowing the investor to reap the rewards of both individual security selection and asset class selection foreword mark anson phd chief investment officer calpers chapter

trading rules in particular it shows how variations in the ratio of momentumtype investors to valuetype investors can have dramatic effects on security prices when the ratio of momentum to value investors is large security prices tend to “explode” when the ratio is low prices fluctuate rather realistically but do not destabilize security prices can also become unstable when traders in a thin

reality began to reassert itself in the fall of  prices began to fall insured investors flooded the market with sell orders turning what might have been a modest correction into a crash even greater than the great crash of cimr grew out of papers i had written in the s describing how portfolio insurance could fail to deliver on its promises and even destabilize the broad market these had been submitted to several journals including financial analysts journal faj where they had been reviewed by mark rubinstein rubinstein a member of the journals’ editorial boards was also a cofounder of leland obrien rubinstein associates lor which managed over  billion in portfolio insurance assets at the time of the crash on the bases of his reviews the journals declined to publish my submissionsgiven this history i was very pleasantly surprised to see a quite favorable review of cimr in the julyaugust  issue of faj book review editor martin fridson stated “jacobs’s meticulously documented book presents compelling evidence    that portfolio insurance failed to deliver on its lofty promises” in the januaryfebruary  issue of faj however fridson published an unprecedented postscript to this review in an abrupt aboutface the “postscript” charged that i “marshaled selected quotations to suggest that promotions in the early s by leland obrien rubinstein associates lor led investors to believe that its portfolio insurance product placed an absolute floor under their potential returns” on the contrary he asserts on the basis of various unnamed sources “lors pre presentations were candid in describing the likely impact on the strategy of greaterthanexpected market volatility”i was allowed a brief response to the charges in fridsons “postscript” in the mayjune  issue of faj “postscript authors comment” my original reply “the marketing of portfolio insurance and the magnification of market risk the whole story” had to be cut substantially in order to meet the faj’s space constraints space in that same issue was nevertheless available to afford yet another comment from fridson “postscript reviewer’s response” fridson essentially concluded that “sophisticated investors who knew the right questions to ask would not have been misled” by lors marketingyet the latter statement is directly antithetical to securities law section  of the investment advisers act of  holds that “caveat emptor” is not an adequate standard of disclosure for investment professionals and the us supreme court decision in sec v capital gains research bureau inc  explains why full and forthright disclosure is required to protect investors from the type of abuses that led to the great crash of  i pointed this out in a letter to the editor “response to fridson’s ‘postscript reviewer’s response’” which faj editor gifford fong declined to publishin june of  pensions  investments pi published an article “praise for book turns to criticism” in which rubinstein admitted that it was he who had “suggested” to fridson that fridson write a “correction” of his original review of cimr contrary to fridsons assertion in “postscript reviewers response” that his anonymous sources “had no obvious reason either to attack jacobs or defend lor”  faj editor fong asserts in this article apparently unaware of rubinsteins admission “if there was pressure from someone on the editorial board i would see that person would not be on the board” fong nevertheless claimed in a followup article in pi “rubinstein to stay on editorial board of faj despite talking with fridson” that “the real question is was mark acting in his capacity as an editorial board member” rubinstein was not dismissedin the fall of  i posted an “open letter to aimr and the financial analysts journal” which documented apparent violations by certain members of the faj editorial board of all five professional conduct standards of the association of investment management and research since renamed the cfa institute this letter also documented violations of securities law and aimr standards by lor including its marketing of portfolio insurance as a “guaranteed equity investment” and its failures to adequately disclose the risks of the strategy the ethical issues involved including aimr’s tacit endorsement of a caveat emptor standard of disclosure and the conflicts of interest underlying faj’s editorial process were further discussed in a series of letters published in pi in the fall of a little less than a year later in july  aimr publicly proposed a set of research objectivity standards for buy and sellside analysts their firms issuing corporations and the media designed to curb conflictofinterest problems in the investment industry my response “bruce jacobs comments on aimrs proposed research objectivity standards recommending that aimr adopt such standards for its own publications” called on aimr to put their own house in order by instituting conflictofinterest and other standards for their own publications this recommendation was picked up by the wall street journal “bids  offers analyst heal thyself” and supported by letters from several aimr member societies this support was noted in an editorial in global investor which concluded that “the spirit of full transparency and objectivity has not been well served” by aimr in its handling of this mattersoon afterward aimr issued a press release “aimr announces new faj editor and new conflictofinterest policies” announcing that it had completed a review of faj’s standards policies and practices and found them in compliance with “best practice” and in keeping with aimrs code and standards the release went on to state that the ethical obligations and conflictofinterest policies governing faj would be published in an upcoming issue it also announced the appointment of a new editor for faj somewhat surprisingly aimr had not formally announced the departure of fong although pi had reported itin view of aimr’s newfound interest in setting conflictofinterest standards for itself and others i submitted to faj a letter to the editor “investment advisory disclosure standards and financial analysts journal conflictofinterest policies” setting forth violations of aimr conflictofinterest and other standards at faj in a cover letter to the aimr board i pointed out that publication of the letter would benefit readers by clarifying the standards of disclosure investment professionals are required to abide by and benefit aimr and faj by allowing faj to proceed with a clean slate under its new editor and newly announced policies aimr’s general counsel later informed me that the letter would not be published in “aimr and ‘best practices’ on ethics” pi december   however i question whether faj will opt for transparency and objectivity given its history and suggest that aimr take a page from the medical journals which provide for a full airing of questionable acts via letters and editorial commentary should faj accept anything less than this as “best practice”the whole debate revolving around faj going back to my original submission to the journal in the s raises extremely troubling questions about the conduct of the faj’s editor and members of its editorial board in addition it raises questions about the aimr’s supervision of faj and its willingness or ability to hold its officials and staff to the same high standards demanded of its members what level of disclosure on the part of investment advisers and managers would aimr desire to see promulgated in its own publications what standards of behavior would aimr expect its officials and staff to followin january  aimr finally published the conflictofinterest policies governing faj aimr is to be applauded for creating and disclosing these standards and it is to be hoped that they will go a long way toward mitigating the pernicious effects of conflicts of interest however aimr could have aimed for more transparency and more effective policies to govern its premier research publicationthe articles synopsized below roughly arranged in reverse chronological order give a more detailed view of

be published in financial analysts journal faj although his “comments and suggestions on conflicts and the appearance of conflicts are thoughtful and are being considered by aimr and the journal editor” the following issues thus remain outstanding faj has never disclosed the conflicted roles mark rubinstein played both in rejecting manuscripts about portfolio insurance in the s and in influencing the book review process in  despite aimr’s assertion that “sunlight is the best disinfectant” when it comes to conflicts of interest “aimr recommends  ‘new year’s resolutions’ for investment community december   does faj mean to condone conflicts of interest on the part of its board members that influence the content and substance of what it publishes faj has never corrected

that can taint investment research and harm investors bruce jacobs finds the same types of conflicts of interest at work within aimr itself in particular aimr’s own publications and conferences can be seen to fulfill a role analogous to that of wall street research analysts the aimr’s financial analysts journal faj for example publishes articles that can form the basis for investment research tools quantitative analysis and portfolio decisionmaking in the real world yet the review process that determines what gets published in faj and what doesnt is fraught with conflicts of interest that

martin fridson writes an unprecedented repudiation of his prior favorable review of a book criticizing those products apparently at rubinstein’s behest editor gifford fong refuses to investigate the matter and curtails the discussion in the pages of the faj leaving readers with the impression contrary to securities law and aimr standards that disclosure by investment advisers is adequate as long as “sophisticated investors who know the right questions to ask” would not be misled these actions violate aimr standards which among other things require members to be familiar with and abide by

portfolio insurance vendor was adequate because “sophisticated investors who knew the right questions to ask would not have been misled” jacobs asserts that this statement leaves readers with the idea that “caveat emptor” is an adequate standard for investment professionals but “caveat emptor” as a standard of disclosure jacobs notes is contrary to the aimr code of ethics and standards of

“postscript” financial analysts journal januaryfebruary  does a disservice to his book capital ideas and market realities cimr and to investors generally by dismissing the book’s presentation of the way portfolio insurance was marketed it is just such marketing creating the false impression that such strategies offer high returns at low risk that allows these strategies to attract investments sufficient in size to threaten market stability jacobs further notes that in contrast to the anonymous “sources” fridson uses to support his claims cimr provides extensive quotations from and references to hundreds of named sources in “postscript reviewers response” fridson states that because the professionals he consulted for his “postscript” “were neither purveyors of portfolio insurance nor investors who ultimately decided to buy the product” they had “no obvious reason either to attack jacobs or defend leland obrien rubinstein associates lor” “based on their detailed accounts” he concludes “sophisticated investors who knew the right questions to ask would not have been misled” by lors marketing in “response to fridsons ‘postscript reviewers response’” which faj declined to publish jacobs points out that given fridson’s standard of “sophisticated investors” it is perhaps not surprising that his “postscript” found that lor was “candid in describing the likely

exaggerated the benefits and downplayed the risks of portfolio insurance to a misleading degree instead he claims “lors pre presentations were candid in describing the likely impact on the strategy of greaterthanexpected market volatility”  fridson bases his conclusion on a single reference to a mark rubinstein article and on unnamed “observers “investment professionals” and “sources” capital ideas and market realities by contrast cites hundreds of named sources including almost all published articles advertisements and marketing materials on the subject that evidence as well as new evidence including lor’s adv filings with the securities and exchange commission suggest that lor’s disclosures were not adequate and apparently violated securities law section  of the investment advisers act which prohibits advertising that is false and misleading as a result many investors were not aware of the strategys pitfalls rather marketing that portrayed the strategy as a means of obtaining high

the fall of  the enormous magnitude of required insurance selling on october   turned what might have been a modest correction into a crash even greater than the great crash of  that crash did not “kill” portfolio insurance the concepts behind it and the methods by which it was “sold” live on in strategies at work in markets today the dynamic hedging underlying option positions is essentially the same as portfolio insurance and has contributed to “minicrashes” in    and  the sad story of longterm capital management shares much with the portfolio insurance story including the concentration of significant amounts of assets in a strategy that was supposed to offer high returns for very little risk the strategys dependence on arbitrage conditions and when such conditions disintegrate the
