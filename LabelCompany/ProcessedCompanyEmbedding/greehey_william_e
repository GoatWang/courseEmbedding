from humble origins to become the chairman and ceo of valero energy corporation one of the largest independent oilrefining companies in the united states greehey saw valero through a price plunge in unleaded gas in the s that threatened its existence he eventually turned the debtridden corporation into a flourishing fortune  company with approximately  employees and revenues of  billion industry analysts and colleagues described greehey as a tenacious man whose ambitious vision ultimately made valero into one of the most successful oil refiners in the nation from small town to big time greehey grew up in the small town of fort dodge iowa in a loving but relatively poor family by the time he was  years old greehey had found employment in order to help support his family equipped with a strong work ethic and a dream of attaining more in life he joined the air force in order to benefit from the gi bill and become the first person from his family—as well as his neighborhood—to go to college after completing his tour of service greehey attended st marys university in san antonio texas at the catholic college marianist brothers helped arrange for further financial aid and greehey also worked nights and weekends parking cars at a hospital he went on to complete his fouryear course of studies in business administration in two and a half years earning numerous academic honors in the process after graduating in  greehey first became a certified public accountant and worked for price waterhouse he then joined exxon as an auditor in  he was hired by coastal state gas corporation where he rose quickly through the ranks to become senior vice president in  at the age of  in the early s greeheys career reached a turning point a subsidiary of coastal lovaca gathering company found itself being sued by naturalgas utilities throughout texas when it could not fulfill its contracts due to a short supply of natural gas in  the courts appointed greehey as lovacas ceo and president and charged him with negotiating a settlement which many industry analysts believed would be an impossible task but greehey proved them wrong and turned the company around by striking a  billion deal in an article in philanthropy world magazine  the former texas governor dolph briscoe noted that taking over lovaca would have been too daunting a task for some people but it never occurred to greehey that he would not succeed in turning the company around and reaching a successful settlement augustseptember  faces new challenge greeheys turnaround of lovaca reached a conclusion in  but his relations with the company had not yet ended the agreement to meet lovacas debts had necessitated the creation of a new company called valero energy corporation when the spinoff occurred in  it was the largest in us history greehey was appointed as the head of valero and soon found a whole new set of challenges awaiting him one of greeheys early decisions was to diversify the naturalgas supplier into the refinement of unleaded gasoline he had a hunch that the company could prosper from increasing fuel shortages and the industrys general lack of specialized refining capacity greehey focused on the use of residual fuel oil a byproduct of the process of crudeoil refinement to produce the desired unleaded gas he made arrangements to obtain supplies from saudi arabian refiners bought an old refinery in corpus christi and spent  million to build a new refinery on the old site in an interview with claire poole of forbes  greehey recalled the headlines in san antonio said buying the refinery was the biggest mistake wed ever make april   for a while it looked as though the analysts would be right a yearlong strike by great britain coal miners beginning in  caused much of greeheys saudi supply of residual fuel oil to skyrocket in price because of the greater demand for fuel with which to fire british boilers greehey and valero were hit again when european refiners decided to boost production of unleaded gasoline from residual oil and then dump stores on the us market as  came to a close greeheys refinery in corpus christi was losing  a day according to some industry analysts the companys stock dropped from around  per share in  to just  per share in  greehey avoided panicking and was determined to see valero through the tough times he sold off the companys west texas pipeline and some of its preferred stock to raise around  million still by  valero had lost approximately  million and incurred around  million in debt the following year greehey decided to spin off a substantial portion of valeros gaspipeline operation into valero natural gas partners a move that reduced valeros debt load by  million and saved the company  million a year in interest expenses in  the bailout started to pay off as refining margins began to improve valero earned  million on sales of  million that year greeheys decision to build the new refinery in corpus christi also paid dividends in other ways because they had constructed one of the most modern and efficient refineries in the country greehey and valero did not need to spend any money to comply with the refinery standards of the  clean air act partly as a result of the act several of valeros competitors were ultimately forced to close down forges ahead valeros earnings reached  million on revenues of more than  billion in  greehey retired as the companys ceo in  but his retirement lasted only four months as his replacement who had become ceo on june   resigned following a board meeting greehey came back on board just as the company was making numerous transactions that focused on the selling off of naturalgas assets in order to reduce the companys operations to oil refining and marketing exclusively by the time valero energy corporation completed its divestitures of the naturalgas divisions greehey had already set in place the foundation for the companys future success according to many industry analysts one of his most significant moves was the acquisition of basis petroleums three refineries the previous april when refining margins between costs and prices had been narrow and owners had been willing to sell analysts pointed out that greehey had been right in predicting that refining margins would widen and that purchasing the refineries to add to valeros only existing refinery in corpus christi would be a boon to the company greehey told david hendricks of the knight riddertribune business news that the second and third quarters were good and the fourth quarter will be very good were going to have a record year august   greehey continued to successfully guide valero in  he was the highestpaid executive of a publicly traded us upstream or downstream oil company although already the largest us independent oil refiner by  valero continued to expand through the purchase of other refineries such as ultramar diamond shamrock in january  valero posted record profits and reduced its debt by  million the company reported net incomes of  million for the fourth quarter of  and  million for the year which were record highs bolstered by the companys success greehey once more looked for acquisitions he told paul merolli of the oil daily  we feel there is room to grow in the east coast gulf coast midcontinent and—excluding california—the west coast january   management style employees first industry analysts noted that greehey had grown up in the face of adversity and that his experience certainly played a role in his neversaydie management attitude they credited his shrewd business deals with bringing valero back from the brink of collapse in the mids colleagues and industry watchers said that his dedication and determination were the primary reasons for valeros overwhelming success over the years both analysts and colleagues noted that in spite of his business wheelings and dealings greehey always considered valeros most important asset to be its employees fiercely loyal to the companys management and workers he referred to them as the valero family this loyalty was best demonstrated by the facts that the company never laid anyone off and that employees received the best pay and benefits in the industry because of greeheys leadership fortune magazine recognized valero in  as one of the  best companies to work for in america greeheys personal philosophy was to share valeros success with the community through various initiatives the company received numerous honors including the points of light foundations national award for excellence in corporate community service and the united ways spirit of america award its highest corporate honor greehey also donated his personal time and money to worthy causes he raised funds to build an athletic arena for his alma mater st marys which named the complex bill greehey arena looking good although greehey had initially planned on retiring in  he continued to lead valero into the st century in  valero had an extensive refining system with a throughput capacity of over  million barrels per day its refining network stretched from canada to the us gulf coast and from the west coast to the caribbean greehey remained optimistic about the future telling merolli of the oil daily  as far as the fundamentals are concerned theyve never looked better to us january   in addition to his duties at valero greehey served in numerous capacities for other organizations serving on the board of trustees of st marys university and on the boy scouts of americas national advisory council he also served on the board of trustees of the united way of san antonio and bexar county and on the boards of the southwest foundation for biomedical research the cancer therapy
