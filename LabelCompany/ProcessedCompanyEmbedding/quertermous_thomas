surgeons help to keep people  from infants to the elderly  as healthy as possible these individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses whether you love or hate going to the doctor the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tiptop shapein  there were more than  million doctors of medicine in the us over  of which were active additionally in  there were about  active general surgeons in the country its important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need how to choose the best one and account for other considerations in order to stay healthydifferent types of physicianspatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetimegeneral practitioner your gp is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups vaccines and to identify health issues gps can treat many different illnesses and injuries from the common cold to a broken arm if your health requires a second opinion or expert care the gp will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issuecardiologist heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country making cardiologists important to your longterm health these physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseasesdentist other than a gp the dentist is likely the most common physician youll ever see these professionals work with the human mouth ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par patients typically go to the dentist twice a yeardermatologist dermatologists are focused on skinrelated issues and diseases from skin cancers to acute acne eczema psoriasis and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars most will also perform annual or semiannual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma the most serious form of skin cancerent if you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out youve likely seen an ent specialist ents handle ailments related to the ear nose and throat often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issuesobgyn for many women their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person these professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health fertility issues prenatal care options for new and expectant mothers neonatal care and childbirth obgyns can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancerchoosing a physicianthere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from but how do you know if theyre the best choice for you here are a few considerations to help you pick a physicianlook at your insurance before you get down to the details you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carriers network rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network out of network is typically more expensive doctors often add and drop plans so its important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses check for board certification your physician should be certified through the american board of medical specialties doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school complete three to seven years of residency training be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more abms exams to be certifiedexamine the reviews reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like people may grade on staff friendliness availability and effectiveness of treatment looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needschoosing a surgeonsurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands and its important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelycompatibility factor you need to feel comfortable with your surgeon its important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have they must take the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan yearif you plan to go to the doctor need medication or have been recommended for surgery call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it×

contribute to the risk for coronary heart disease one such gene tcf encodes a basichelixloophelix transcription factor believed to serve a critical role in the development of epicardial progenitor cells that give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle cells smc and cardiac fibroblasts using reporter gene and immunolocalization studies with mouse and human tissues we have found that vascular tcf expression in the adult is restricted primarily to adventitial cells associated with coronary arteries and also medial smc in the proximal aorta of mouse genome wide rnaseq studies in human coronary artery smc hcasmc with sirna knockdown found a number of putative tcf downstream pathways identified by enrichment of terms related to cad including vascular disease disorder of artery and occlusion of artery as well as diseaserelated cellular functions including cellular movement and cellular growth and proliferation in vitro studies in hcasmc demonstrated that tcf expression promotes proliferation and migration and inhibits smc lineage marker expression detailed in situ expression studies with reporter gene and lineage tracing revealed that vascular wall cells expressing tcf before disease initiation migrate into vascular lesions of apoe and ldlr mice while tcf lineage traced cells are distributed throughout the early lesions in mature lesions they contribute to the formation of a subcapsular layer of cells and others become associated with the fibrous cap the lineage traced fibrous cap cells activate expression of smc markers and growth factor receptor genes taken together these data suggest that tcf may have a role regulating the differentiation state of smc precursor cells that migrate into vascular lesions and contribute to the fibrous cap and more broadly in view of the association of this gene with human cad provide evidence that these processes may be a mechanism for cad risk attributable to the vascular wall view details for doi journalpgen

apj constitute a signaling pathway with numerous effects on the cardiovascular system including cardiovascular development in model organisms such as xenopus and zebrafishthis study aimed to characterize the embryonic lethal phenotype of the apj mice and to define the involved downstream signaling targetswe report the first characterization of the embryonic lethality of the apj mice more than half of the expected apj embryos died in utero because of cardiovascular developmental defects those succumbing to early embryonic death had markedly deformed vasculature of the yolk sac and the embryo as well as poorly looped hearts with aberrantly formed right ventricles and defective atrioventricular cushion formation apj embryos surviving to later stages demonstrated incomplete vascular maturation because of a deficiency of vascular smooth muscle cells and impaired myocardial trabeculation and ventricular wall development the molecular mechanism implicates a novel noncanonical signaling pathway downstream of apelinapj involving gα which induces histone deacetylase hdac  and hdac phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation resulting in activation of myocyte enhancer factor  apj mice have greater endocardial hdac and hdac nuclear localization and reduced expression of the myocyte enhancer factor  mef transcriptional target krüppellike factor  we identify a number of

disease activity we have investigated whether protein microarraybased abundance measurements of circulating proteins can predict the severity of atherosclerotic disease using a longitudinal

function to identify differences in longitudinal gene expression patterns of atherosclerosis we have developed and employed a statistical algorithm that relies on generalized regression and permutation analysis comprehensive annotation of the array with ontology and pathway terms has allowed rigorous identification of molecular and biological processes that underlie disease pathophysiology the repertoire of atherosclerosisrelated immunomodulatory genes has been extended and additional fundamental pathways have been identified this highly diseasespecific group of mouse genes was combined with an extensive human coronary artery data set to identify a shared group of genes differentially regulated among atherosclerotic tissues from different species and different vascular beds a small core subset of these differentially regulated genes was sufficient to accurately classify various stages of the disease in mouse the same gene subset was also found to accurately classify human coronary lesion severity in addition this classifier gene set was able to distinguish with high accuracy atherectomy specimens from native coronary artery disease vs those collected from instent restenosis lesions thus identifying molecular differences between these two processes these studies significantly focus efforts aimed at identifying central gene regulatory pathways that

hipscs have been described as embryonic stem celllike these cells have a distinct gene expression pattern compared to hescs making incomplete reprogramming a potential pitfall it is unclear to what degree the difference in tissue of origin may contribute to these gene expression differences to answer these important questions a careful transcriptional profiling analysis is necessary to investigate the exact reprogramming state of hipscs as well as analysis of the impression if any of the tissue of origin on the resulting hipscs in this study we compare the gene profiles of hipscs derived from fetal fibroblasts neonatal fibroblasts adipose stem cells and keratinocytes to their corresponding donor cells and hescs our analysis elucidates the overall degree of reprogramming within each hipsc line as well as the distance between each hipsc line and its donor cell we further identify genes that have a similar mode of regulation in hipscs and their corresponding donor cells compared to hescs allowing us to specify core sets of donor genes that continue to be expressed in each hipsc line we report that residual gene expression of the donor cell type contributes

the expression vector psvgpt with sequence coding for a portion of the gamma b constant region and the catalytic beta chain of tpa this construct was transfected into heavy chain loss variant cells derived from the d hybridoma recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed with electrophoretic transfer blots these revealed a kda heavy chaintpa fusion protein that is secreted in association with the d light chain in the form of a kda disulfidelinked dimer chromogenic substrate assays showed the fusion protein to have  of the peptidolytic activity of native tpa and to activate plasminogen as efficiently as tpa in a competitive binding assay reconstituted antibody was shown to have a binding profile similar to that of native d thus by recombinant techniques we have produced a hybrid protein capable of highaffinity fibrin binding and plasminogen activation view details for web of science id ak view details for pubmedid  measuring the human tcell receptor
