to individual and institutional investors and can be customized to meet the needs of each clients investment policy investment process the investment research process is focused on finding companies that create return on invested capital above their cost of capital which can further translate into an increased share price for stockholders this is achieved through both bottom up fundamental analysis and top down macro theme development key in the process is finding companies that are making strategic decisions and have catalysts driving their performance which have yet to hit the company�s financials thus equity investments are sought in companies that display fundamental growth characteristics and trade at a price discount to their modeled intrinsic value upon completion of due diligence companies are compared and selected for investment when they are trading at a discount to their modeled intrinsic fair value in an environment where that value can be realized by the market in the next  years generally investments are sold when one of the following conditions is met the company has reached its modeled fair value and therefore has no further investment upside company specific andor industry macroeconomic factors no longer support the intrinsic value framework another investment opportunity offering more value is identified client customization the investment process can be further customized to meet the needs of each individual clients investment policy  this is accomplished by narrowing the investment style to meet each clients investment
