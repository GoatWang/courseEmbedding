officially ours although i think we could do one more i always feel like one more one more but david feels strongly that we are pretty fullup and busy parenting these kids he believes we should stop and give what we can to these kids and do that well david is very smart about these things so i am slowly moving into this way of thinking but we aren’t done with being a positive force in the life of foster kids what i’m about to tell you is a tradeoff of sorts we can stop fostering but i want to do this one thing… and david has agreed i was inspired by a couple of articles this new york times piece from last year the power of a dinner table by david brooks and this piece children on the cusp the transition from fostercare to adulthood is leaving some behind by camalot todd in the las vegas sun they made me want to do something for kids aging out of the system the idea – hosting a kitchen supper every friday night australian chef bill granger originally created this concept he hosted a small supper at his house sitting in the kitchen not the dining room – too formal on a weeknight to connect with friends nothing too fancy and easy enough to do every week not a dinner party – a supper cozy food a few simple dishes no appetizers no crazy desserts just good homecooking and inviting a family or two that we love… and – the important bit – opening our supper to agingout or agedout foster kids who want to hang out use the wifi talk to some good people get welcomed like family make new family eat a good meal know they are connected to other people who aren’t being paid to be with them feel safe that’s it just feeling safe and relaxed cared about we are working with dcfs to make this happen and will be reaching out to friends to invite them to kitchen supper we also welcome our friends to reach out to us the photos you are looking at were shot by my good friend artist photographer emily wilson her work is amazing please check her out she came for lunch one day and as it is with photographers the day became a shoot and it was so much fun she came back that evening and shot our first official kitchen supper with drew cohen and scott seeley owners of the writer’s block the best bookstore in vegas and soontobe fosterdads drew came over early and we cooked the dinner together it was so much fun this got me thinking what if kitchen supper guests could come early and cook with us cooking at pm and dinner at pm yes i want to do that every week so that’s the plan supper every friday night at our house come at pm and cook come at pm and eat together be there for a teen who is moving out into the world alone without solid family connections tell a kid a funny joke give them a little advice learn to cook something teach someone to cook something so thank you people we love for being there for our foster kids and creating all kinds of community for them as they have moved in and out of our house as we close out our foster care license and adopt our kiddos and become one big ridiculous family we want you to join us again on our next adventure… being there for agingout foster kids at least some of them as many as we can email us if you’d like to come cook eat drink see what happens    if you are in las vegas and we know each other or are connected through friends and you want to attend a kitchen supper you can email me at kimatfosterentertainmentdotnet or text me at    to get on the calendar more importantly if you know a foster youth who is in the process of agingout of the system or has agedout and might need a free dinner and a safe place to hang with some cool folks please get ahold of me motherless may     april   our caseworker emails us she is cancelling weekly visitations with our foster kids and their bio parents chrissy and jay then a second email comes in the da sent the paperwork to the court the judge signs off the caseworker calls chrissy and tells her the hard news it’s official our foster children’s bio parents have no rights to the kids that will not change our babies are officially freed for adoption i sit on that for awhile i instagram it with a photo of the baby i write it’s official our kid’s bio mom and dad have lost their parental rights i am happy for our kids who have a family now and us because we love them so much but that happiness is tempered by knowing the cost of everything that has happened to them i also am thinking about bio mom and all that she has lost because her life is a true true mess even bad parents love their babies and kids still love their parents even when they’re shitty at parenting today i am aware of love and family and all it’s skyhigh joy and its complications and contradictions onward to adoption then i pick up the phone find chrissy’s number and not knowing what to say i write hi how are you this is a wideopen question i have no idea what she’ll say if she’ll even write back she just got a job working at  her first in eight years i doubt she will hang onto it for long predictability showing up consistency of any kind is not her strong suit she is pregnant again something she told me two weeks ago if we were to have a visit next week before it was cancelled i was going to bring her folic acid and prenatal vitamins but now i know i won’t see her to give them to her so she won’t have any not that prenatals can stop what might happen to this inutero baby chrissy says she has to get out of town soon before she starts showing so dcfs doesn’t take her baby and she is right of course now that her rights have been taken away every baby she has in nevada will be taken from her dcfs will by law not have to go through a protracted reunification process they will never let her keep this baby nor should they so she’ll move disappear hide and fuckup this kid as long as she can get away with it until they or some agency in another state find her again she texts me back from a number i don’t recognize hey kim this is my state phone i can only cry and call i can’t get videopicture mail on here…but i’m doing okay she goes on to blame her caseworker for her losing the kids she tells me she feels “stupid” about the whole thing like it was a terrible practical joke and she fell for it she goes dark for a few days and i check in again how are you okay she writes back she asks me to send photos of the kids to yet another number i don’t recognize the phone issue has thrown her life into chaos or really her life is in chaos and the phone thing is a symptom chrissy and jay routinely have their phones stolen and it takes days into weeks to wrangle new ones i shoot photos all weekend intending them for her when edie feelings hurt says “why aren’t you taking photos of me” i tell her “these are for chrissy” she gets it but stomps away but i never get to send them i never get to text chrissy at all in fact these are the last conversations i have with her   april  my children’s bio mother dies i get the call around pm the day after it’s jay jay is the baby’s bio dad but has been in our son’s life for as long as he can remember jay is hysterical he is so upset i can’t tell whether he is laughing or crying whether this is a happy call or a sad one but he never calls me like this so it can’t be good we were watching movies he tells me chrissy jay and her fiancee all watching movies together i’m listening i’m pacing in the street barefoot scared to be in the house in case the kids might see my face and demand to know what’s happening they want to be in the middle of everything we thought she fell asleep…i tried to wake her up…but blood came out of her mouth he can barely get the words out i gave her cpr but at the hospital she was brain dead they let her go… i’m stunned and freaked out i don’t know why but it hits me hard like i’m being impaled through the gut i feel the world go gray the sorrow i feel for her – yearsold – life over never achieving much except for these kids is a hard nugget in the middle of me how will i tell our boy i think tell me the truth i say in my most serious voice was she doing drugs drugs she wasn’t supposed to be doing i know the answer yes  what morphine…i told her not to take those anymore i told her  jesus how do you get to be yearsold and popping morphine while you are hanging out watching movies while you are pregnant how does that happen how does it fall apart like that so fast he says the end for her was losing the kids are you saying she did this on purpose i ask i’m defensive is this on me i’m thinking no no i don’t think so he says but he is bewildered not sure of anything i told her she can have a relationship wth the kids jason i say …even though her rights were terminated i told her didn’t she know that yes…i don’t know… he cries some more the next thing you know i’m talking to david in the bedroom telling him about her and i start to cry hard like i come undone david pulls me in and i cry into his shoulder the kids are all out on the trampoline just outside the bedroom door laughing jumping oblivious   april  i’m thinking a lot about how the funeral home won’t talk to me i mean i’m no one to them stacy at the funeral home is a complete bitch to me after she finally takes my call obviously the drug addicts have been calling the funeral home and she is done with them jay stops returning my calls i won’t call chrissy’s methheadbikerfiancee or whatever he is who has beaten her up in the past i feel the danger of him from across town he scares me i remember when chrissy sent me the photos what he had done to her face and body – bruises welts soft brown and blue indentations in her skin and then two days later she brings him to a weekly visit with the kids at mcdonalds he gets loud and in her face while she’s holding the baby and it so freaks me out i run into the play area snatch the baby and shut down the visit from then on we meet for supervised visits at the visitation center at dcfs now his facebook says they are married hers says she is engaged jay tells me in a text he was still with chrissy he says they all live together in the same roachinfested trailer park it’s all just quagmire and deception their whole lives but i don’t want to speak to the methbikerdude because she overdosed on his watch i want to blame him for the shitty choices she’s made that have impacted her kids but i know it’s all her she made these choices he is only a recent player i wonder in my journal if anyone will show up for chrissy if there will be a service a celebration to remember her all the light she put into the world before her light went out before drugs and abuse and the shitty life she led with her drugaddicted friends and her torn relationships i want to celebrate her some way i want the kids to see her celebrated but funeralhomestacy is not letting me near chrissy then the bikermethheadabuserfiancehusband calls me he calls me on her temp phone but because i had put her in my contacts her name is blinking out at me like she is talking to me from the dead   april  i have chrissy’s sister here can she speak with you i am a known bio parent facebook stalker it’s a gift and a curse  i do it with all my foster kids sometimes it gives me an idea where the kids come from and how the parents are faring after chrissy dies i’m on facebook checking out methhead biker dude’s feed i see that her sister jane has commented on a post where methheadabuserbiker has announced his fake marriage to chrissy jane identifies herself as chrissy’s sister and asks him to pm her i do what any selfrespecting stalker would do and i follow her page back to her profile jane is so pretty older than bio mom she has three nearlygrown beautiful kids she has a business she goes to school she is in a relationship she has drinks out with girlfriends you can tell she loves the hell out of her kids her life looks insanely normal – i wonder how many strings chrissy cut before jane pulled up stakes and refused to let chrissy bring her down jane is crying on the phone she is surrounded by crazy people in the trailer park she is looking for her mother’s ashes which chrissy stole years ago hording them in her piles of junk she is surrounded by the crazy i know so well methheadabuserbiker dude says jay killed chrissy jay says methheadabusivebiker dude pushed pills down her throat jane has to threaten to call the police to get the crazy people to turn over her mother’s ashes i can tell jane is drowning that she had no idea chrissy’s life fell so far down the hole it is all a horrible shock and she has no idea where chrissy’s kids are she tries calling dcfs but they shut her out they tell her chrissy’s rights are terminated as are the rights of the rest of the family emma’s law prevents biological families from appearing out of the woodwork and claiming kids who are already settled into families dcfs tells her nothing jay tells her he supports us adopting the kids but she wants to see them i think she needs to see them with her own eyes i think she imagines them in the trailer park with her mother’s ashes   april  jane and i connect on facebook and i see a post where she asks for prayers for my kids the post is from days ago before we talk on the phone before she knows the kids are okay i so get why she is scared for them but seeing the post rattles me people send prayers some woman named laurie writes i’d take them in a heart beat and i’m thinking yo laurie these are my kids these are my friggin’ kids you can’t have my kids laurie poor laurie she’s just trying to be sweet i mean i would probably say the same thing but i’m still mad and crazyscared so i take to my journal and i write down intensely and with so much fear and ferocity all the ways we have become family to each other and it occurs to me jane will try to take my kids how could she not i mean my kids are awesome and it fills me with such fear and dread and anger that i can barely breathe i walk around like i have a lightning rod through me i can’t sit because i feel like i should be doing something i pace and i’m short with the kids and i picture my life without them all and i feel like my lungs will explode i take to a foster parent facebook group and ask can they take my kids i get all sorts of paranoid guarded answers about protecting the kids and circling the wagons and emma’s law and hiring lawyers and shutting out the bio family and being at the will of family court judges and all of it feels weird and hostile and unnecessary and then a wise lady named wren writes my kid’s bio grandma was at our adoption but we are weird that way and david says most of the time things work out okay and these two things set me right most of the time things work out okay and i want to be weird that way so i decide my goal is to have my kid’s bio family at our adoption we invite jane to our house i send her my address and ask her to please not give it to the methheadabuserbikerfiance and the others and she writes back i am never speaking to them again in my life…i don’t want them near those kids i like her before i even meet her   april  it’s the middle of the night the night before jane and a few other family members come to our house i can’t sleep i’m scared to death they will try to take them from us it’s easier to be angry then sad because the saddness is so much   april  i mean to make the bio family breakfast but i can’t pull it together but the house is clean and i haven’t spilled tea down the front of me the kids are relatively clean david is mountain biking but he calls me  times during the morning so i know he is eager too i tell myself to be open like wide open to expect the best of people and i remember that these are the family of my children and i will love them because i love the kids and they and we are all connected when i change my mindset and think of them as all of us being on the same team i feel the love coming out of me this is the right way to go i want to hug these people i should’ve done this more in my life i think note to self for the future they say they will be here between  and am they are at the door at the crack of  so i know they are eager too there are a bunch of them jane chrissy’s sister jill chrissy’s godmother annie chrissy’s cousin and her partner billy and her yearold son the boys – newly minted cousins – run off together barely heard from again we hug we introduce we have small talk where we let each other know we are normal and nice and then jane suggests we sit out on the patio and i’m mortified because i haven’t dusted off the cushions but i see they do not care like they truly do not care about my housekeeping they are not judging me they make me at ease in my own home they are broads i see it especially chrissy’s godmother they are spirited strong women kind loving open i love them before they even sit on my dusty patio furniture and we just start talking and it’s not dumb conversations we talk about the kids what they’ve been through we talk about chrissy’s childhood tonapah where it all seemed to go wrong for her we talked about how they saw the photos of the kids on facebook the pics i took and sent chrissy and how they thought the kids were okay with their mother we talked about how the coroner said she wasn’t really pregnant so many lies uncovered excavated and seen for the truth we talked about how they had to create space for themselves away from chrissy because she was so unhealthy they talked about how hard that struggle was and the guilt they have now we are all asking could we have done more but every answer we turn to the answer is no she was so far gone then because they are so open we start talking about the kids and the future do you want to adopt them jane asks is that what you and david want yes we want to adopt them i say we love them they’re our babies…i say and then i add but we want your blessing we want you to be there at the adoption we want you in the their lives and our lives and here’s where this plays like a movie there is hugging and crying and this understanding that out of all the shit out of all the crazy ugliness something good – something really good and healthy – has come there is never a funeral we choose to honor chrissy this way   april  so lost these are the last words jay texts me his phone is stolen he says so we are texting on his “obama phone” no videos and photos i text i offer to meet him so he can see the kids i tell him our boy would like to visit that it would good for both of them to process the loss of chrissy together he never texts back i think how lucky he is to be able to see these kids after his rights have been terminated and how stupid he is for not taking me up on it his loss big time done texting for now he is not their only biological family anymore   april  for our boy and eventually the baby this grief thing is going to be a lifelong process he doesn’t have the immediate questions like who will put me to sleep or who will feed me  chrissy never did any of those things that he remembers but the long ongoing questions they linger he sleeps with the blanket chrissy and jay gave him he sleeps with “puppy” a soft floppyeared dog they gave him during one of their visits at dcfs i make him a memory box with photos and things i kept from her that he mostly likes to sit in he doesn’t talk about it much the first few weeks even though i check in often but now he is starting to ask the big questions like why i tell him mommy was very sick and she took medicine to help her pain but she took too much she was watching a movie and went to sleep and her body stopped working someday we will tell him everything but not now he wants to know about her heart and her brain and how they slowed down and stopped working he wants to know about the movie he says with a lot of confidence people can die while watching movies and so now we have to unravel the connections between watching movies and dying i wonder if i was too specific we are trying to decipher what he is thinking as he says things i’m trying to find the right words he says to david i’ll have to get a new family if you and mommy and lucy and edie die… david answers him we won’t die for a long long time you will always be with us we will always love you now we have to stay alive and keep that promise pressure   april  i see him walking his scooter on the street going to a friend’s house he is making the asl sign for “i love you” he chrissy and jay used to say goodbye at visits with that sign their hands touching chrissy is never too far away   april  this is so weird to write – i realize how much i miss chrissy half the time our relationship was me railing at her in my head for her erratic drug addict behavior for hurting our boy at visits by her various absurd and toxic actions but chrissy and i had this one thing that bonded us – me sending her photos and videos of the kids i started doing it for her i kept doing it partly for me i want to share these moments with someone i want someone else to see the baby saying new words like “headband” and our boy tearing it up on the bmx track i want to send someone  videos  of the baby saying abocowdoe avocado and love it as much as i do david might kill me if i send him  videos of the kids while he’s working but chrissy had hours to fill and wanted to see them as much as i wanted to send them one mom to another i missed that when she died the way we bonded together over the kids but then jane steps in she wants to see tons of pics of the kids she wants to make up for lost years she wants to be in their lives she wants them to mean something to her and her to them so i send them to jane now maybe not  videos a day but enough and if it annoys her she hasn’t complained and a hole in me has been patched   april  we are getting ready to go to the park with annie and our boy’s newlyfound cousin who he adores we are all making good on the promise to stay in touch send photos be present in each other’s lives more family  more love the whole thing he is asking me about babies and i tell him they grow in mommy’s tummies i didn’t grow in a tummy yes you did i say you grew in mommy chrissy’s tummy no i didn’t he says i’m from child haven he is talking about the emergency shelter in vegas where kids live until they are reunited with birth parents or move to foster homes he had done two long hard stints there no baby you don’t remember but when you were very little you came from chrissy’s tummy no mommy i grew in child haven and then he skips away and i let him go he has the last word on his own life        all names except for david and i have been changed to protect privacy love love love april     on a foster parent fb group a firsttime foster parent said she was nervous about meeting her kiddo’s bio mom for the first time she asked for advice a lot of the conversation was about whether you should give out your email and cell to bio parents and what was safe and not  this is what i wrote it’s as much advice as it is a reminder to myself  i think it’s important to remember that you might be the only healthy person in bio mom’s life that means you are there for the kids first of course but also for her i expect that every mom wants to be heard and understood so i try to listen and give her love even when she is misguided and hard to handle i don’t believe in “never give her your cell” or “never never give them too much they’ll take advantage” you have to go into it heart first and decide what to do based on that specific mom or dad every bio parent is different we’ve had a bio mom that we’ve let come to the house and see the kids whenever she wanted we’ve helped bio moms get jobs and picked them up from prison at am and arranged a place for them to stay today i spent the morning calling a nonbiological father figure in my foster son’s life trying to arrange a visit because i think it would help my son process some things he has questions about we do this even though every single right dad has as the baby’s dad has been terminated because relationships aren’t legalities some parents we’ve pushed out giving them tough love because they were so unhealthy and messed up because they didn’t know boundaries and needed us to teach them but i’ve always sent pics stayed connected and listened i always remember i have their babies and how downright terrifying that must be for them i always give my cell if they want it i text photos and videos our current foster son’s bio mom died and i realized after how much i missed sending her pics and videos we spent a lot of time loving the kids in our own way i mean who wants to see  videos of a baby playing peekaboo only the other mama that was ours we shared that funny i thought i was doing that for her sending all those pics to help her stay connected wrong it may have started that way but really i got so much out of it and now i miss the hell out of it and remarkably her  if you love the kids you have to love the bios even if you don’t love the things they do or the ways they hurt themselves and the kids you can protect the kids and yourself – and you should ferociously – but you can do that and be loving at the same time mostly trust your heart stay open love love love      the piece i originally wrote has been edited for better readability here but not much roachland january     we are at a jackinthebox it’s me david our foster kid’s bio mom and the baby’s dad we are stuffed into a tiny booth a group of school kids are all around us gossiping and drinking cokes every booth is filled with people a bunch of kids hang out by the soda machine it is loud and raucous not the kind of environment you imagine for talking about such a serious thing mom is late she is always late and not by a little not like  minutes or something she is  minutes late to everything  but i get why she is late dragging her feet this is not going to be fun we are a half hour into the wait and david and i are sipping on coffee talking to bio dad about what it’s like to work as one of the costumed characters on the strip he shows us photos of him dressed as the hulk or captain american or whomever and tells us he can make  for a few hours work “that’s pretty good money” i think better than i thought they did he is living in a weekly hotel dubbed “roachland” on tripadvisor because it’s overrun with roaches bed bugs and the occasional scorpion  like i’m not sure the reviews could be any worse reviewers are writing “run before the roaches get you” he lives with a few other people in a one bedroom there when someone leaves he will bring bio mom in so she can live in roachland too i get this vision of my foster kids living there it makes me scared for them and maybe scared for all the other kids i know are living in roachland bio mom shows up but she doesn’t come in she stalks the sidewalk in front of the door she smokes and stalks she is palpably nervous bio dad goes out to her they stay outside talking and stalking until she drops her butt on the ground and comes in we are negotiating the open adoption of the boy and the baby she starts to cry before she sits down bio dad grabs her leg in support i grab her hand i don’t have any words to describe this moment except that she is giving her children to us but it is not a gift she would take them back to live in roachland in a minute she knows the courts will take away her parental rights in marchan open adoption would be her only hope of seeing them of having contact she is stuck between two hard unwavering places we talk for a bit about the kids and i show her a video of the baby trying to say the word “pumpkin” which comes out “pompom” it is so ridiculously adorable we all have to laugh and it pops the boil of the moment and gives us space to breathe then we do the business we meter out the terms of the open adoption they get pics and videos of the kids and updates on how they are and visits when the children want to visit we say it is up to the kids not either set of parents they want every holiday with the kids they want us to give them overnights with the kids they want to join us for christmas dinner and birthday parties they know these things cannot be promised but mom cries when she finds out we won’t be coparenting making decisions together sharing the children she cries the hard relentless can’t catch your breath crying head in her hands tears on the table bio dad squeezes her knee some more he is wiping his eyes i hold her hands with both of my hands now as if that will hold her from falling off the cliff of her despair we are locked in this moment all connected but also at odds with each other we are the perfect definition of “frenemies” and then bio dad says he just wants the kids to be happy it is part selflessness and love and part experience he has already lost all of his other children but these are the first for bio mom she can’t breathe or continue on my heart hurts for her but it also hurts for the kids their story isn’t just about poverty it’s about willful neglect constant chaos homelessness and transience their story is about drug addiction mental illness and family dysfunction so thick and stubbornly intergenerational that won’t shake out over  years i had practiced for this moment there is a part of me an adopted child myself that feels her pain sometimes when i least expect it i feel on some visceral invisible wavelength that she might be my bio mom and feel all the ghost feelings i imagine my bio mom felt it is classic transference  these feelings make me want to forgive all her sins against the kids and hold her and tell her it will be okay and invite her to christmas dinner but i know that’s me that’s my shittyass baggage that i carry around like a tramp on a train what i really need to do here and i know it is offer her compassion and my empathy while protecting her children from her we need to save the children first – david reminds me of this often and she needs to save herself if she even can so i had to practice for this moment i opened up this giant well inside me to hold her feelings to see them and take them in and deliver back to her kindness love and listening but i make it my mission to keep her feelings in the well i am all boundaries i muster all of my directness and tell her what we were prepared to give and not give we can have visits as long as the kids want them and when they want them as long as it is good for them as long as they are not hurt we cannot promise any of these visits in a contract but we will make it happen if they want them we will send videos and pictures i always do several times a week i feel happy to share these with her this is easy to give with no pain to the kids this part of it is one mom to another mom i won’t take that away from her they listen and absorb they stop crying there is banter now some lightness in the middle of the storm a mention of the baby and how she is the spitting image of her bio dad we smile all together just thinking of her no matter what we have this one ginormous thing together – we all love the hell out of those kids this unites us always somehow we all see this we decide to sit on things think about them but we also silently agree to proceed we hug i tell bio mom to text me later if she needs to talk she will she has noone in her life besides bio dad and they are no longer together she needs to talk sometimes and she calls me when she does david and i leave jackinthebox they stand outside and smoke it takes me days to shake off their sadness this weird little fucker of a day november     this day this weird little fucker of a day trump wins the presidency and i wake up and my girlfriend comes over crying i’m not crying because i can’t even feel it and all its ramifications i haven’t even had caffeine i feel nothing but the movement of the day plugging away david always the aussie is shocked and pummeled too but cracking jokes about americans we deserve it still i say maybe you should become a citizen because well you never know… i mean now we don’t really know what could happen lucy wants me to do her hair and make her a salad for lunch she will eat out of the vending machine if i don’t school vending machines might be worse than trump i think i get on the salad i talk to her about the election as i chop she tells me her best friend is a republican and a trump supporter and she had no idea she is processing this and what it means does it mean anything i don’t know i thought only white people like trump she says her best friend is black after school she tells me they talked about the election in every class in her school which is heavily mexican and that kids talked losing their parents to deportation losing their homes and businesses if one parent is sent back losing their insurance when obamacare is repealed they cried at their desks the baby wakes up this morning smiling happy as larry and when i look at her i realize she has no idea half the country is sad and shocked and gobsmacked and because i can’t explain my deflated feelings to her toddler mind i snuggle her soft warm chubby body i giggle when she giggles i make myself we lay together waking up for a few minutes happy to be together she brings a relief but really i have to keep smiling for her or she will think it’s her because babies always think it’s them they take the blame so i smile and cuddle and laugh this weird little fucker of a day goes on it has to our boy has a visit with his bio mom today – if she shows up – and he is lit up a fire rod electrified in flames a mess and his caseworker comes i am expecting her and the house is kinda clean but she sees him flipping out sees how these visits light him up she sees him play with the baby too hard destroy things jump off tables and slam himself into the sofa how he won’t listen to me i don’t want him to grow up to be the boy who can’t listen to other people i don’t want him to be rough in all hs relationships like trump i want him to have good connections to people but he can’t control all the bad stuff inside not all the time not yet and our neighbor next store locks himself out of the house so we were all there trying to pick his lock with a credit card and a butter knife then a neighbor a trump supporter comes by on his bike and does it bang bang opens that door it’s like the trump people can make anything happen today i think such a nice guy is he racist xenophobic homophobic sexist and he’s just hiding it from me while he rides in to help a neighbor in need how can he be so nice and filled with hate at the same time is that even possible i look at everyone now staring at them as if i can see who they voted for as if that tells me who they are i mean doesn’t it say who they are or am i the bigot relying on stereotypes to categorize people ugh and then i take the little ones to school and the boy won’t let me leave he falls into me kissing my face begging me to stay clinging to me in my arms for the longest hugs a half hour before he was so angry he wanted to punch me now he is submerged into me the visits are hard business so much emotional gravel that gets turned over his life his brain and his heart are a tumult a struggle i feel it so hard that i can’t even care about who sits in the big white house i have to fix this here i think this little tiny stuff is ours to overhaul and mold and work with things aren’t right i still haven’t had caffeine and edie is awake and hungry and needs food so i provide it i have to teach her what has happened the night before i have proof positive now to show her that we live in a place that needs work needs to be overhauled needs to be molded things aren’t right and when she wants answers i say start here start on this street start in this family start in your girl scout troop start with strangers you meet start here be kind listen more than talk be open to change tell your own stories loudly listen to other people’s i get some tea finally i let that seep in and i call my mom and it starts as i hear her voice before i even say hello the only thing she can eat on the menu at the home where she lives is pot roast and she’s sick of pot roast would you want to eat pot roast every day and trump is a jerk but at least hillary didn’t win then she tells me she hates the lady at the bank and the guy who runs her home and hillary who should be in jail and the country and the world and everything in it it’s the computers fault she says if we didn’t have computers…then she reminds me she is alone and that because i have so many kids she is on the bottom of my list and i choose to put her at the bottom because i have so many kids and she might as well die that’s right die it would be better for her and for everyone she explains this reminds me of my grandmother who in the throws of alzheimers used to say she would die if i left the house mom is  she has so many muddled anxious obsessive thoughts this catches my heart i worry for her i visit but she won’t live here and i can’t live there “you moved away…you had too many kids” she tells me over and over also and she’d want me to tell you this – it pisses her off that hillary kept everyone waiting for her concession speech because she didn’t think she would lose arrogant women are the worst i’m not crying i’m not even angry on the surface anyway i can hardly look at social media because it’s everyone’s anger bleeding all over everything people yelling and lecturing and i don’t want everyone else’s anger to be my anger because anger is a burden to carry i spend a lot of time processing it on a regular day so i do not have to hump it around on my back like broken old hunch back and truth be told i don’t have even one tiny fucker of a moment to dwell on this election or our bigoted presidentelect it is what it is i have work to do things are not right there are things here in my perimeter that need to be overhauled little people that must be molded loneliness that must be mended love that must be spread peace that must be given pain that must be healed mistakes that must be fixed and i’m just gonna keep at it   imstillwithher letlovewin familieslikemine      traumas   feelings ago october     the other night david and i had a hard talk it was about four kids and how exhausting and hard and crazy it all was how we were up before light and exhausted and half asleep trying to binge watch something in the evening…remember when we got to binge watch tv babe and how we are fighting for moments alone together – when the walkin bedroom closet is the only place – and struggling to connect and struggling to finish a conversation and struggling to meet the huge needs of all our kids how our kids get so much needier when the foster kids come in how they all need individual love how we break apart and soothe them each individually to make sure everyone has enough we held hands across the pillow a sick kid in between us a metaphor and wondered if we had enough to keep us going to keep or marriage from slowly inching toward an abyss and dropping off without anyone really knowing why it slipped over the edge they seemed so happy… the people would say we didn’t stop holding hands two is easier than four maybe we should’ve just left well enough alone…what the hell did we do then unable to think about it anymore we fell asleep nothing was parsed out it was left hanging there between us the next day started with the usual business no time to revisit feelings there were lunches to pack faces to wash foreheads to kiss problems to untangle work writing shopping stacks of paperwork i’ve been putting off for weeks two ballet classes an art class the little ones’ visit with bio mom lots of driving from here to there every section of the schedule fitting like a tightass puzzle of interlocking parts and then a call on the road his bio mom wasn’t coming he ran to me in the schoolyard calling my name hugging my legs the next thing he said was “are we having a visit today” i told him no hugged him and said i was sorry he pretended it didn’t matter and changed the subject we left it all to be unpacked for later in the wee hours of the night in the slanted quiet moments of the day when he could hear it and speak it and move on from it sigh sometimes being a foster parent makes you feel like a placeholder like the bio parents are taunting you “hey thanks for taking care of my kiddos and dealing with a whole lotta shit and creating a quagmire in your life and fucking with your marriage so i can do my thing in peace over here…” but sometimes it’s like this mission where you see what it all really means – how you are the only people who are calm and predictable in a kid’s life how you are the only ones who show up when you are expected to show up how you are the people who do exactly as you say you will do and a kid starts to understand this is as normal his normal and you know at seven months into this relationship with these kiddos he is starting to expect that kind of normal and he is already a less damaged person in the world because of it and you remember why there are so many reasons four is good these tiny little wins matter david and i are okay way better than okay we make sure of it this moment the one in the bed with all the hand holding happened two weeks ago and we’ve talked it through created a plan to make it easier on us and burned through it to the other side i found my description of it sitting on the computer this morning i barely even remember the serious tones that i wrote here it was  traumas and  feelings ago we move fast we make choices like adding more kids to the family maybe we will even add more after this…there has been talk sometimes these decisions feel like weights and sometimes they set us free choosing to have these two join our older two feels sometimes like we threw ourselves into the eye of a tornado but mostly it feels like we are all so good for each other the inbetween september     we are at a pool party  our lovely friends are there there is laughing and chatting and a clinging to the end of summer just a little longer one more dive off the board a girl about  is swimming with our foster son “where is your mom” i hear her ask he points to me sitting on the edge my feet dangling the baby is between my knees sitting on a shallow step slapping the water “no i mean where is your mom…your real mom” our boy points again at me as if she didn’t catch it the first time i know what’s going to happen next first because i’m adopted and i’ve answered this line of questioning many times in my life also because i have no idea what he will say and i’m freefalling a bit knowing i will simply back up whatever he says but not knowing what to expect we’ll see how this goes… this is the first time we have done this answered these pointed specific questions from a kid grownups are more coy they want to hear the hardship tale and the happy ending but they can handle a no or an “i’m sorry i can’t” kids are different if they want to know the nittygritty of your shit they’ll keep on asking you until they drive you to your knees they give zero fucks if they offend your sensibilities so i’m freakin’ but the boy has no idea what the girl is talking about “that’s my mom” he says and kind of blows her off blowing bubbles into the water he gets she is getting at something but he isn’t quite sure what “that’s not your mom” the girls says with so much clarity and confidence in her voice “you are a foster kid” boom she said the words i take a breath and hold it but i let it go when i see his blank stare and i realize he has no idea he is a foster kid or even what a foster kid is and since our last name is foster this also confuses the issue altogether like maybe he is a foster kid like all of my kids this makes me smile i step in then i say to the little girl “i’m his mommy” i say it loud and strong so he hears and he looks at me like “duh” “the rest is hard to explain” i say to her gently when she looks like she might challenge me “he has a lot of people who love him” this seems to satisfy her and she swims away the boy after her there that’s settled for now our family exists in the undefinable inbetween – until some court makes it permanent or doesn’t until then these two are ours and not ours someone else’s but not theirs either we plan as if every plan will come to fruition we push them support them challenge them heal them soothe them cuddle the hell out of them as if we will see the results of this work we might we might not we love like it’s always in the most brazen inyourface idon’tgiveaflyingfuckaboutthefutureandhowitwillcrushusway we do because foster parents do it’s the job they tell you this going in of course but you don’t get it until you realize it’s a oneway street and there are no brakes on your gocart and you are barreling ahead  mph you are just in it clutching the wheel and screaming your lungs out for dear fucking life while the wind rips at your face that’s the emotional side of foster parenting all in  mph so this is how i explain us – maybe not to kids in pools but to myself  – i’m the mom so is she it’s complicated love is big enough to include all of us the future is uncertain and scary and unknowable and full of amazing possibilities this is family crazy messed up weird family but still family and it’s all worth it these kids all of my kids are worth it love – even love that comes from loss – is magic normal august     david just came back from edinburgh the kids and i had five days alone together oy let me just say that when you have a great partner you do feel their absence there is a space that goes unfilled not just emotionally like “i miss you” but in all the areas at first it seems fine they are gone we eat easy dinners of frozen food there are no dishes to be done yay we stay up a little later we read one more book at bedtime it’s fine we all say to ourselves but then the new normal seeps in and it isn’t as good it doesn’t run as smoothly there are cracks and fissures we hate the frozen food and we long for a roast chicken dinner we are tired and need our old sleep rituals we feel cranky and we don’t now why then by day four its friggin’ clear that something is amiss and the rhythms are off and there is babywailing for no reason and boyactingout for no reason and the voices are louder and the confusion is greater we are losing things and the older girls are having tantrums about it the children need a lot more attention but i’m just struggling to cook the damned chicken and i can’t hold them all in my arms and love them all while i cut vegetables and do dishes and pack lunches and i need some time to myself that would be nice to have a complete uninterrupted thought but we are in triage mode so i’m not even thinking about that that’s laying on a beach in the sun on a far off tropical island fantasy shit okay so maybe i’m not as patient as i usually am because everyone is mad mad mad mad just fucking mad i control the mood in the house i know that so i change it up i stop everything that is practical and efficient i corral them there all there on the couch and we lay around feet over feet legs over legs watching sharknado for the rd time because it’s stupid and awesome and it makes everyone happy we laugh we scream we hide our eyes when the sharks eat the bad guys in lots of tacky bloody glorious bits i let the dishes curdle in the sink i let the leftover food sit out on the kitchen counter this helps me giving them all my attention but i grumble in my head about having to do the dishes at  o’clock tonight then i let it go i smile at them i kiss their little heads i rub their little feet i make fun of ian ziering in my head and david is on a plane oh yes he is somewhere over greenland he tells me on international wifi but he cannot get here soon enough for all of us finally he comes and just stepping through the door they all run to him and grab him around the waist the legs and the baby toddles over and falls on his feet it isn’t that second but maybe an hour or two later – after the hugs and cuddles on the couch that happen before he has even taken off his jacket that twilight time where they fill him in on everything their voices and stories overlapping and gifts bought at the airport get handed out and unwrapped – that the normal comes back there is dinner and he and i debrief quickly in the kitchen between quick thechildrenarewatching kisses and there are baths and the readying for school and the uniform that needs to have an emergency washing or else the universe will crack into millions of pieces and the girlchild will explode from embarrassment and all the other completely essential routines of the night he takes a shower to wash off the plane i make us a cocktail we hold hands and bingewatch some show we are addicted to he is jetlagged part of his body still lingering in britain but most of him is here most of him is here and the normal seeps back in everything calms down i will be able to sleep tonight first time i’ll get a sound sleep for four nights normal we go back to the way we were all together i see our children breathe again their anxiety quiets like shallow unmoving puddles of water we are okay put back together back to normal only august     i’m trying to write this while lucy is blaring hamilton making me listen to particularly genius lyrics and riffs ones that speak to her so personally she must listen to them over and over as i did when i was her age with captain fantastic and the brown dirt cowboy and goodbye yellow brick road and honky chateau singing those lyrics over and over like they were some kind of otherworldly manual for the life i wanted to have i with my ear to the big speaker her with her ear to the phone edie is clinging to my waist she is bored so bored so bored and now they are fighting screaming at each other but then again they aren’t now they are talking in soft tones talking about how they are going to punch each other and puke on each other’s hair and they laugh so i know they are not serious and they tell me they enjoy trash talking each other the crueler the better…”you’re so ugly even hello kitty said ‘goodbye’ to you” edie says and lucy responds  “i love your hair  it’s just like rapunzel’s…except she has fewer dreads” they love twisting the words into something nefarious and still coming out of the loop fine and whole and together  i wonder who i trashed talked as a kid…no one only children don’t trash talk the shadows on the walls or did i and did they respond back maybe so much going on in my head back then in my room being the only one they are watching something on tv  now and they turn to tell me various things happening in the storyline i don’t care about the details but i love being in the room with them hearing their chatter their constant love – almost addiction for – each other’s attention so much reaching out to each other so much slapping and soothing slapping and soothing slapping and soothing sisters at the same time i want to flee this room with them in it and be alone in silence and quiet and my own thoughts and words my own shadows dark and looming as they may be burr is getting on my last wired nerve playin’ over and friggin’  over edie she plops down on top of me – a loving longing hug that stops my freedom to move and smothers me in her deep limitless heart and pins my right arm down underneath her and i cannot bang out another word the words simply stop they stop because i am surrounded by my people i am not an only anymore nothing is just mine thank god my tolerance for aloneness has been loosened and uncinched by their insistence i think they do not care that i write as long as i write about them as if my quiet time any time i have is still also theirs and edie is reading this over my shoulder spectacle august     last night we went to a birthday party it was one of those wonderful parties thrown by a wonderful family with swimming and tea parties and a bedlam of kids big and small clamoring through the house with their still wet feet and just out of floaties exactly how you want to celebrate a twoyearolds birthday david was there for the first hour and there weren’t many kids so our foster son was pretty good in the pool but then david went to a meeting and throngs of kids came and the atmosphere turned happily chaotic and crazy all in a good way but for a kid who can’t navigate chaos who thrives on structure who loses his mind in a playroom full of guns and arrows and toys that that can be crafted into guns and arrows which is like every toy on earth it was brain scrambling he ran away from me he stomped his feet he refused any and all requests if i touched him he shook me off we were a parenting spectacle normally we have one parent on him and one on the baby and both of us manage any issues with lucy and edie even though there are rarely issues so i was basically running through groups of kids happily crawling playing running holding the baby like a football and chasing a child who wanted none of my balls and chains i decided no yelling at him i did not need to be the parent at the party who screamed at their kid also a parenting spectacle i must’ve looked desperate because people jumped in to help thank you village but help sometimes doesn’t help several people tried to get him to settle down and eat like the other kids they got him food they were sweet but i knew he could never sit and eat at this party we had plied him with grilled salmon aka pink chicken and vegetables before the party so we didn’t have this argument eating at the party was never going to happen an older woman was listening to us when i told him he didn’t have to eat his pulled pork sandwich i know this sounded like submission bad parenting not staying strong whatever you want to call it but we cannot have standoffs while children stampede around us knocking back cupcakes and capri suns it doesn’t work it is again a parenting spectacle i didn’t want to have but with everyone of these fails we learn our limits like maybe we can’t take him to parties when the child to adult ratio is  maybe we can come early and leave early maybe he can go a little wild and be a little disobedient sometimes as long as he doesn’t hurt himself or someone else maybe we celebrate on another day with the family something more low key and manageable for him maybe next time he will get it and he’ll relax and be okay maybe maybe someday not every new thing will make him anxious and act out because he can’t control it maybe someday he will have friends who he doesn’t push away maybe he will be able to shake off all the foster homes and the early neglect and the changes and the flimsy foundations built for him maybe someday he will stop fighting everyone and everything maybe he won’t blow everything up that’s good because he distrusts it maybe he can relax and know he’ll be just fine maybe someday    …  older about me im kim foster i’m a novelist essayist
