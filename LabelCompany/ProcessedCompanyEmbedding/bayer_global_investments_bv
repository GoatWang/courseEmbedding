donate facebook twitter keycode bayer  press release  january  bayer appearing poor to tax authorities appropriate taxes for multinationals the chemical and pharmaceutical company bayer has systematically moved profits to lowtax countries the corporation thereby reduces its tax burden at the expense of taxpayers in germany the united states or france bayer has  subsidiaries in the netherlands alone this however has little to do with patriotic feelings of the ceo marijn dekkers the reason is that holland aggressively advertises its offers for saving business taxes the use of intellectual property and trademark rights in socalled “patent boxes” for example is taxed at only five per cent thus the bayer subsidiaries in germany or the uk can claim the fees for something such as an aspirin licence as a reason for tax reduction while the fees hardly matter in terms of earnings in the netherlands the country is also suitable for an intercompany bank that lends money for investments to the divisions the interest on the credits reduces taxes in germany but it hardly lowers the profits in mijdrecht at bayer world investments bv in  bayer therefore transferred shares worth  billion euros from the united states to bayer world investments in holland the subsidiary bayer global investments received  million euros from french divisions additionally the bayer capital corporation granted loans of  billion euros in the netherlands bayer uses belgium for tax evasion purposes too because the country allows interest on equity in  the company doubled the funds of its subsidiary in antwerp raising them to eight billion euros and could transfer its profit of  million euros almost completely to germany it only had to leave  million euros which is equivalent to a tax quota of  per cent in luxemburg bayer profits from concessions for insurances both its indurisk rueckversicherung ag and its pandias re ag are located there the trick is to make profits where they won’t lead to any costs and to make losses where there is the threat of tax authorities bayer´s chief strategy and portfolio officer werner baumann calls this tactic “a changed regional distribution of results” baumann is the head of the global tax projects department the employees in this department work amongst other things on “tax planning” and “transfer pricing” that is calculating the price for intercompany deals of trade mark rights licences and actual products tax dumping is very harmful for society this can be seen in the german city of leverkusen where bayer’s headquarters are situated even though bayer is the most valuable german company leverkusen has been financially suffering for two decades during several years the municipality was forced to introduce emergency budgets because bayer paid hardly any taxes – in some years such as    and  none at all the latest catastrophic news for leverkusen came in may  and was connected to bayers takeover of merck´s division for overthecounter products announcing the deal the company declared “bayer expects significant tax savings from the first year after completion onwards” in leverkusen alone there will be eightfigure losses in tax revenue this year the municipality will receive only  million euros of trade tax from all companies it should be mentioned for purposes of comparison that bayer alone paid twice that amount in  the german corporate tax reform of  already played a significant role in reducing the taxes paid by german corporations from that time onwards bayer paid no trade tax or corporate income tax at all for years between  and  the company was paying about  billion a year in corporation tax however in  tax payments dropped to  million and to  million in  the “golden law” that made this possible was drafted by heribert zitzelsberger former head of bayer´s tax department whom the company dispatched to the german finance ministry the coalition against bayer dangers demands an end to the destructive tax race jan pehrke from the coalition’s board says “the fact that bayer hardly contributes to community financing is unacceptable the company is steadily abdicating its responsibility towards the general public at the expense of taxpayers who have to pay the bill through rising taxes and levies it is high time to ensure that large companies take an appropriate share of the tax burden“ the coalition has been monitoring bayer since  overview  bayer investor relations menu contact share search de homeinvestorsoverview overview bayer group about bayerkey figuresprofile and
