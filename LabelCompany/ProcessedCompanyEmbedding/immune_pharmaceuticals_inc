new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall

complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic

personalized therapy that targets and lowers eotaxin levels in many inflammatory conditions  it is being studied to see if it will improve outcomes in patients with diseases that do not have therapies or the therapies have severe limitations bertilimumab is a firstinclass monoclonal antibody designed to block the protein eotaxin which is responsible for causing inflammation in a significant number of diseases it is currently in clinical development for bullous pemphigoid an orphan autoimmune skin blistering disease ibd crohn’s and colitis and atopic dermatitis eotaxin causes eosinophils to migrate toward sites of inflammation where they release substances that damage tissue and enhance inflammation by neutralizing eotaxin bertilimumab may prevent the migration of eosinophils thus helping to relieve inflammatory conditions associated with the protein it is important to note that eotaxin is not only the target but also the biomarker for treatment personalized therapies are designed to optimize safetytoefficacy ratio by selecting patients with higher response rates based on specific biomarkers our precision medicine bertilimumab may enable the identification and treatment of patients with elevated eotaxin as is found in some autoimmune diseases bertilimumab was developed by cambridge antibody technology now part of medimmune the biologics division of astrazeneca immune took responsibility for product supply and all nonophthalmic indications in june  while ico therapeutics retains the rights to develop any ophthalmic indications phase  clinical

trials and orphan drug designation for bp following investigational new drug ind clearance from the food and drug administration fda   nanocyclo nanocyclo is the next generation topical treatment for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis cyclosporin a is a wellknown smallmolecule widely used to prevent organ transplant rejection it has also been approved to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis and for local use in the treatment for dry eye and some forms of keratitis it is an immunosuppressant drug interfering with the activity and growth of tcells which are key in the inflammatory cascade the nanoformulation enables the molecule to better penetrate into the skin layers and provide a local action on skin lesions the benefit for the patient is to avoid potential effects of systemic cyclosporine a including severe infections and adverse effects on the kidney function immune pharmaceuticals inc is partnering with yissum hebrew university of jerusalem for the

phrma’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall

complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic
