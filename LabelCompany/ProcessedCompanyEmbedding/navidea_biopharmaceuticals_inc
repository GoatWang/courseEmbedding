active clinical diagnostic programs in cardiovascular disease rheumatoid arthritis kaposi’s sarcoma and colorectal cancer diseases representing both major macrophage activation states   cardiovascular disease – the results of a study to evaluate diagnostic imaging of emerging atherosclerosis plaque with tc m tilmanocept were published in early release in the journal of infectious diseases on

immunoconstructs consisting of a therapeutic molecule conjugated to moieties targeting cd macrophages    mt designed to specifically target and kill activated cd macrophages by delivering doxorubicin and  mt designed to inhibit the inflammatory activity of activated cd macrophages by delivering a potent antiinflammatory agent   in the first quarter of  mt completed its third vivo study dosing either mt or mt in a wellestablished mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseasenonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis in which both compounds significantly reduced key disease parameters   also in the first quarter of  we completed a series of predictive in vitro screening tests of the mt and mt therapeutic conjugates against the zika and dengue viruses and against leishmaniosis these

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the
