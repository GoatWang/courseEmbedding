new rebranding campaign ads next to the expressway in dorchester by deirdre fernandes globe staff  may   eastern bank has spun off its innovation lab’s first product and most of its core development team into an independent company an acknowledgment that in the fastchanging financial technology market a bank may not be the best place to grow numerated growth technologies inc is expected to launch wednesday offering software that allows banks to make quick loans to small businesses the platform was developed at eastern labs which was created three years ago advertisement numerated has raised  million in financing led by venrock the venture capital arm of the rockefeller family and st louisbased cultivation capital eastern bank remains an investor and floridabased fis which provides much of the technology used by banks is also participating in the first round of financing said dan o’malley chief executive of numerated until last month o’malley ran eastern bank’s labs about  lab employees have moved to numerated with him get talking points in your inbox an afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news delivered weekdays sign up thank you for signing up sign up for more newsletters here being at eastern with access to its data and consumers was essential in developing the lending platform which allows smallbusiness owners to get a loan under  online in about five minutes o’malley said eastern introduced the express loan technology in  and so far four banks including eastern and some community banks are using it o’malley hopes the technology will be in hundreds of banks within a decade but that would require a greater infusion of capital and partnerships with other companies such as fis o’malley saideastern spent about  million on labs last year advertisement when it launched in  eastern bank officials saw the labs as a way for the  billion institution to make inroads into the financial technology space where startups are threatening traditional bankinglabs developed the new rapid loan product and recruited more tech workers to eastern said bob rivers chief executive of eastern bank “it was great for our brand” he said “do we think we can replicate it sure would we replicate it in the same way i don’t know”eastern officials are still working on the next version of labs which the bank plans to continue under new leadership and with a new focus spinning off numerated may have been the best way for eastern to recoup its technology investment and allow the platform to grow said dave kucera a venture partner at fintech forge which brings banks together with technology partners banks which are riskaverse and compliancefocused have struggled to keep pace with innovation and their internal investments in technology haven’t necessarily yielded gamechanging results such as the online payments system paypal which made online shopping simpler he said financial institutions thought it would be easier to innovate
