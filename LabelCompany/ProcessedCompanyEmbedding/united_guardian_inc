most important products lubrajel and renacidin are registered as trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office in  sales from these two product lines accounted for approximately  of guardians sales and  of the sales of the company as a wholeprincipal products  lubrajel lubrajel is a line of nondrying waterbased moisturizing and lubricating gels that have applications in the cosmetic industry primarily as a moisturizer and as a base for other cosmetic products and in the medical field primarily as a lubricant in the cosmetic industry it is used primarily as a stable gel for application around the eyes and on the face and as an ingredient in skin creams and moisturizers makeup body lotions hair preparations salves and ointments as a medical lubricant it has been used on catheters prelubricated enema tips and thermometers the most important product in the lubrajel line in  was once again lubrajel cg the original form of lubrajel the second largest revenue producer in the lubrajel line was lubrajel ms lubrajel rr and rc are special grades of lubrajel that can withstand sterilization by gamma radiation which is one of the methods of terminally sterilizing medical and hospital products on april   the company was granted a us patent for this unique form of lubrajel in september  the company entered into a marketing agreement with avail medical formerly horizon medical a california company engaged in the development and manufacturing of products and services to the medical device and pharmaceutical industries avail has been actively marketing lubrajel rc since january  lubrajel rr the original radiation resistant form of lubrajel is sold to medical device manufacturers primarily for use in lubricating urethral catheters the company believes that its ability to increase sales of its lubrajel products will depend on a the ability of its marketing partners especially isp technologies inc isp its largest marketing partner to continue to bring the product to the attention of new customers and b the companys success in bringing to market new forms of lubrajel that will enable the product to be used in new applications the company is currently developing new varieties of lubrajel for this purpose in  the company introduced a new lubrajel under the name lubrajel ii xd and intends to expand this new line further at the end of  it also introduced a new lubrajel line using a different preservative system which the company believes will attract new customers and retain existing customers that might require a different preservative system it also intends to develop some new skin care products that will have enhanced feel and additional luricating andor moisturizing properties the company believes that there is still significant potential to expand the sales of its lubrajel line of products through both product modifications and by geographic expansion especially in developing markets such as mainland china india and eastern europe the company believes that any sales increases in the lubrajel line of products may be offset somewhat by sales of competitive products despite this competition the company believes that it will still be able to expand the market for its lubrajel product line the company believes that lubrajels reputation for quality and customer service as well as future additions to the lubrajel line will enable it to continue to compete effectively in the marketplace renacidin renacidin is a urological prescription drug approved in the us only which is used primarily to prevent the formation of and to dissolve calcifications in catheters implanted in the urinary bladder it is marketed as a ready to use sterile solution under the name renacidin irrigation renacidin irrigation is also approved for

guardians research and development department has developed a large number of products that can be used in many different industries including the pharmaceutical medical cosmetic health care and specialty chemical industries these products are in various stages of development some being currently marketable and some being in the very early stages of development requiring a substantial amount of development work to bring them to market research is also being done on new uses for currently marketed products once a product is created the initial development work on it may consist of one or more of the following a laboratory refinements and adjustments to suit the intended uses of the product b stability studies to determine the effective shelflife of the product and suitable storage and transportation conditions for the product and c laboratory efficacy tests to determine the effectiveness of the product under different conditions after the research and development department has completed its initial work on a product and is satisfied with the results of that work further development work to bring the product to market will continue including some or all of the following a animal and human clinical studies needed to determine safety and effectiveness of drug or medical device products which would be needed for submissions to the appropriate regulatory agencies such as the united states food and drug administration fda or the united states environmental protection agency epa b preparatory work for the filing of investigational new drug applications or new drug applications c market research to determine the marketability of the product including the potentialmarket size and most effective method of marketing the product d scaling up from laboratory production batches to pilot batches and then to full scale production batches including the determination of the type of equipment necessary to produce the products e upgrading or purchasing new equipment to manufacture the products and f the negotiation of joint venture or distribution agreements to develop andor market the product some of the foregoing work may be done by outside contractors while there can be no assurance that any particular project will result in a new marketable product or a commercially successful product the company believes that a number of its development projects including those discussed below may have commercial potential if the companys development efforts are successful the companys major research focus is the development of new and unique personal care ingredients the following are some of the projects the company is either working on at the present time or which the company intends to work on in the near future new form of lubrasil this will be a new addition to the companys lubrasil product line that will contain a much higher level of silicone which the company believes will create an expanded market for these types of skin care products selfpreserving polymeric thickener this product will be a selfpreserving raw material for cosmetic use that will enable cosmetic formulators to formulate preservative free cosmetic products skin sensorial agents a line of products that will enhance the feel of skin care products the new lubrasil mentioned above might be one such product microemulsified antimicrobial this would be a new form of antimicrobial product for use in skin disinfection products the product could be sold either as a raw material or as a finished product in a hand cleanser lubrajel ii this product line was being developed to recapture some of the market share that the company has lost over the years to some of its competitors the first product in this line lubrajel ii xd was developed to be a dropin replacement for one of those products and is currently being actively marketed the company hopes to expand this product line over the next few years introducing new formulations that have enhanced properties over competitive products this new line is intended to be a supplement to not replacement for the current line of lubrajel products its composition also will enable it to be used in certain countries such as japan more easily than the current lubrajel formulations because other projects have higher priority it is not expected that there will be new products launched in this line in  cloronine cloronine is a powerful disinfectant germicide and sanitizer for disinfecting medical and surgical instruments and equipment particularly where autoclaves are not available and for the purification of water supplies the product had been approved for certain uses in france and canada and is still being sold on a very limited basis in canada the company is currently working with a new potential customer for this product that is exploring possible use by the government as a decontamination agent however before this product can be marketed in the united states for any purpose additional testswill have to be done to determine if the product can be registered with the epa as a sterilant or germicide these tests would comprise laboratory microbiological studies compatibility studies and specific studies on its intended uses the product may also have to be registered with the fda as an accessory to a medical device neither registration process has yet begun due to the expense and time required the company hopes to work jointly with other companies to obtain these registrations the company was granted two patents for this product cloronine gel this would be another form of cloronine in gel form which may increase its effectiveness and functionality the company expects its research and development costs for fy to be comparable to those of the last two fiscal years any additional increase in development andor production costs will depend on whether capital investments are required in order to continue development work on or to manufacture any of the new products under development trademarks and patents the company strongly believes in protecting its intellectual property and intends whenever possible to make efforts to obtain patents in connection with its product development program the company currently owns many united states patents and trademarks relating to its products the company has patent and trademark applications pending with respect to a number of its research and development products patents formerly held by the company on certain products have expired there can be no assurance that any patents held by the company will be valid or otherwise of value to the company or that any patent applied for will be granted however the company believes that its proprietary manufacturing techniques and procedures with respect to certain products offer it some protection from duplication by competitors regardless of the patent status of the products the various trademarks and trade names owned or used by the company in guardians business are of varying importance to the company the most significant products for which the company has a registered trademark are lubrajel renacidin and clorpactin set forth below is a

information confidential eastern chemical corporation eastern is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company it distributes an extensive line of fine organic chemicals research chemicals test solutions indicators dyes and stains and reagents in  and  easterns sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the total product sales of the company the companys business activities and marketing efforts over the past several years have focused increasingly on the guardian division which the company believes has greater growth potential than eastern as a result the company has been reducing the amount of inventory kept on hand by eastern which in turn has resulted in some decline in its sales there also has been a general decrease in easterns business due to competition from new companies in this field the company has considered and will continue to consider the possibility of selling eastern at such time as it determines that keeping the operation is no longer in the companys best interests the company believes that if it were to sell eastern the loss of revenue from that subsidiary would not have a material impact on the companys net income marketing guardian markets its products through a distributors b advertising in medical and trade journals by mailings to physicians and to the trade and c exhibitions at appropriate medical meetings the pharmaceutical products are sold in the united states primarily to drug wholesalers that distribute to drug stores for resale and to hospitals physicians longterm care facilities the veterans administration and

manufacture or compounding of their cosmetic personal care or industrial products easterns products are marketed through advertising in trade publications and direct mailings they are sold to distributors and directly to users in a wide variety of applications eastern does not sell any unique products and is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers on a continuous basis domestic sales in the united states the companys cosmetic products are marketed exclusively by isp in accordance with a marketing agreement entered into in  and subsequently amended and expanded in   and  see marketing agreements below isp also has certain rights to sell some of the companys other industrial and medical products in  isps purchases for distribution in the united states were estimated to be approximately  compared to  in  a decrease of  and accounted for approximately  of the companys sales note isps domestic sales figure is an estimate based on sales information provided to the company by isp the company has no way of independently determining which of isps purchases from the company are intended for domestic sale and which are intended for foreign sale the company believes that the decrease in isps domestic sales of the companys products was the result of the discontinuation by some of the companys customers of some products that contained the companys raw materials however this decrease in isps domestic sales was offset by an increase in isps foreign sales of the companys product the companys domestic sales of pharmaceutical products are handled primarily through the major fullline drug wholesalers and account for approximately  of the companys sales the companys other products such as its industrial products are sold directly to endusers and account for less than  of sales foreign sales in  and  the company derived approximately  and  respectively of its sales from customers in foreign countries primarily from sales of its cosmetic products in europe and asia the company currently has six distributors for its personal care products outside the united states with isp being the largest isp has global distribution rights with the exception of the following s black ltd in the united kingdom sederma in france luigi  felice castelli srl in italy s black gmbh in switzerland and cm international in korea the companys foreign sales attributable to each of its foreign distributors as a percentage of the companys total sales were as follows isp  an estimate of isps purchases intended for sale outside the us based on sales figures provided to the company by isp sederma  s black  cm international  and castelli  the company also has two foreign customers for its medical products that each account for approximately  of the companys total sales marketing agreements in  the company entered into a marketing agreement with isp whereby isp would distribute the companys personal care products as well as some medical and industrial products in certain parts of europe asia australia and africa isp manufactures and markets an extensive line of personal care pharmaceutical and industrial products on a global basis in  the parties entered into another agreement extending those distribution rights to theunited states canada mexico central and south america in july  the parties entered into an exclusive marketing agreement the  agreement which modified extended and consolidated the  and  agreements the  agreement also gave the company greater flexibility in appointing other marketing partners in areas where isp was not active or had not been successful gave isp certain additional territories and granted isp exclusivity in the territories assigned to it as long as annual minimum purchase requirements were met in december  the parties entered into a letter agreement  agreement that extended and modified the  agreement and provided for automatic extensions of the  agreement through december  provided isp met certain purchase requirements during each calendar year of the agreement isp was not able to meet the minumum purchase requirement for calendar year  but the company agreed to continue isps marketing rights based on its satisfaction with isps marketing efforts in december  the parties entered into another letter agreement  agreement modifying and extending the  agreement and superceding and replacing the  agreement the  agreement extended isps marketing rights until december  and provided for the possibility of additional automatic extensions until december  if specified miniumum annual purchase levels were attained it also specifed guideliness and provisions for future price increases by the company the company believes that in the event isp were to cease marketing the companys products alternative arrangements could be made to continue to supply product to the customers currently using the companys products without any significant interruption of supply the company has other marketing arrangements with marketing partners in the uk france switzerland korea and italy but all of these other arrangements are operating under either verbal agreements or expired written agreements and are subject to termination at any time by either party raw materials the principal raw materials used by the company consist of common industrial organic chemicals laboratory reagents and common inorganic chemicals most of these materials are available in ample supply from numerous sources the companys principal raw material suppliers are procter and gamble callahan chemical company univar usa inc noveon inc ishihara usa nissei trading co varessa ltd ei dupont sa fine chemicals and loba chemie inventories returns and allowances the companys business requires that it maintain moderate inventories of certain of its finished goods historically returns and allowances have not been a significant factor in the companys business backlog the company currently does not have any significant backlog competition guardian has many products or processes that are either unique in their field or have some unique characteristics and therefore are not in direct competition with the products or processes of other pharmaceutical personal care chemical or health care companies however the pharmaceutical health care and cosmetic industries are all highly competitive and the company expects competition to intensify as advances in the field are made and become widely known there may be many domestic and foreign companies that are engaged in the same or similar areas of research as those in which the company is engaged many of which have substantially greater financial research manpower marketing and distribution resources than the company in addition there are many large integrated and established pharmaceutical chemical and cosmetic companies that have greater capacity than the company to develop and to commercialize types of products upon which the companys research and development programs are based however the company believes that the expense of testing and evaluating possible substitutes for companys products that are already in customers formulations as well as the expense to the customer in relabeling its products is a significant barrier to displacing the companys products in current customer formulations these cost factors make it less likely that a customer would choose a competitive product unless there was a significant cost savings in doing so the company believes that manufacturing regulatory distribution and marketing expertise will be increasingly important competitive factors in favor of the company in this regard the company believes that its marketing arrangements with its global marketing partners will be important in the commercialization of many of the products which it is currently developing eastern faces competition from many other chemical manufacturers and distributors many of which have much greater financial resources than those of the company easterns competition is based primarily upon price service and quality eastern attempts to maintain its competitive position in the industry through its ability to i locate and make wholesale arrangements to purchase the chemicals with suppliers located all over the world ii maintain a sufficient inventory of its most popular items at all times and iii customize each order as to quantity of the item requested and to tailor the price of the order to such quantity easterns primary competitors are sa fine chemicals acros organics pfaltz  bauer inc and spectrum chemical mfg corp iso registration in december  the company earned iso  registration from underwriters laboratories inc indicating that the companys documented procedures and overall operations had attained the high level of quality needed to comply with this new iso certification level and has been in continual compliance with that new standard since that initial approval prior to that in november  the company had earned iso registration the company will continue to be evaluated every six months for continued compliance with the new iso standard government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacturing and marketing of many of the companys products the company and many of the companys products aresubject to certain government regulations products that may be developed and sold by the company in the united states may require approval from federal regulatory agencies such as the fda as well as state regulatory agencies products that may be developed and sold by the company outside of the united states may require approval from foreign regulatory agencies any medical device products developed by the company will be subject to regulation by the center for devices and radiological health of the fda and will usually require a k premarket notification most pharmaceutical products will require clinical evaluation under an investigational new drug ind application prior to submission of a new drug application nda for approval of a new drug product a drug product normally must go through several phases in order to obtain fda approval the research phase involves work up to and including discovery research and initial production next is the preclinical phase which involves studies in animal models necessary to support an ind application to the fda and foreign health registration authorities to commence clinical testing in humans clinical trials for pharmaceutical products are conducted in three phases in phase i studies are conducted to determine safety and dosages in phase ii studies are conducted to gain preliminary evidence as to the efficacy of the product in phase iii studies are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy including dose regimen phase iii is the final stage of such clinical
