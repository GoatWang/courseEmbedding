warrior ms ’ cheme has had a thirtyyear career in the tech sector rising to her current position as chief technology and strategy officer at cisco systems this was not her original plan  her plan was to earn a master’s degree in chemical engineering at cornell in the lab of her adviser ferdinand rodriguez and then to continue on to a doctorate also with rodriguez “he was always very flexible and encouraged me to push boundaries” says warrior her doctoral plan was derailed and her future altered simply by agreeing to do a favor for a friend “it was by sheer accident that i ended up working” says warrior “i went to a job fair with a friend of mine who was finishing up her phd in chemical engineering i just walked with her to keep her company” at the job fair one thing led to another and before long warrior had a job offer from motorola when she told professor rodriguez about it she fully expected it would be a oneyear position out in industry and that she would return with more focus for her research project “he said ‘go for it i’ll keep your project waiting for you’ but i never went back every christmas i would get a card from him saying ‘hey when are you coming back’” warrior’s first job was at the motorola facility in arizona she was one of only a few women working there at the time but this was nothing new to her while working toward her undergraduate chemical engineering degree at the prestigious indian institute of technology in delhi warrior was one of five women in an engineering cohort of  students during her master’s study at cornell most of her chemical engineering classmates were male at cisco a company with over  billion in revenues in  and more than  billion in profits the executive leadership team is  percent women which is more than double the average at the largest publicly traded silicon valley companies warrior’s long and successful career in the tech world has earned her widespread recognition including commendations from the women in technology international hall of fame the international museum of women and forbes magazine which placed her on the list of  most powerful women in technology for  as chief technology and strategy officer at cisco warrior helps shape the direction of technological research innovation and applications at the forefront of the digital world including cisco’s leading role in driving the internet of everything but she also uses her position to speak out about the need for more women in leadership roles in the tech sector “i have been pleased to see more women in the stem fields in schools and i think it’s trending in the right direction but in the workforce progress is much slower” says warrior when asked why it would be valuable to have more women in decisionmaking roles at technology companies warrior says “technology going forward will become more blended it is becoming a combination even in the products we build—it’s combining user experience  and user interface design with engineering” she continues “so you have to have a multidisciplinary approach and i think women tend to be better at that in the stem fields women offer a very different perspective we don’t think just of the technology but also of the implications of the technology the value of technology the impact it will have on people’s lives and the concerns about privacy on all of these things women offer a very wellrounded perspective…” when asked about the specific challenges women in leadership roles face in the tech world warrior says “women have to overcome more barriers we don’t get as many passes as guys do a woman in engineering and stem fields almost has to outperform her male peers to get recognized it’s unfortunate but that seems to be the norm” warrior sounds hopeful about the future for women in the tech sector “as you see more women leaders in the field that will change” nationally women make up  of the students enrolled in undergraduate engineering degree programs cornell engineering’s  freshman class is  women with leaders like padmasree warrior excelling in positions at the highest levels of the technology industry the path for these female cornell engineers to positions of real power may be a little easier warrior has come a long way from her start in the united states when she arrived at cornell with an undergraduate engineering degree  and a oneway ticket she returns to cornell at least twice a year now though these days she comes to campus for meetings of the board of trustees where she was recently elected to a fouryear term facebook twitter youtube

until recently was known as nextev is developing autonomous electric vehicles padmasree warrior the ceo of the us operations of nio is seen she regularly graces lists of the most powerful women in silicon valley her resume includes long stints in the top ranks of motorola and cisco but now padmasree warrior is taking her talents on the road a year ago warrior  plunged into the world of automobiles becoming the ceo of nio usa a company formerly known as nextev which is seeking to make smart autonomous electric cars she’s also the chief development officer and a board member of nio’s parent company in shanghai dubbed “queen of the electric car biz” by fortune warrior oversees more than  engineers at nio’s sprawling san jose offices replete with creative touches like a living plant wall and graffiti art as well as a capacious garage area right now nio which has a permit to test autonomous cars on california roads is using “donor cars” tricked out with its sensors and software until its own cars are ready for testing in  and warrior because she can’t yet have an autonomous nio drive her around town has to get behind the wheel of a tesla model s an engineer at heart warrior

paul chinn the chronicle padmasree warrior leads upstart in push for autonomous cars    back to gallery nio was founded in  by entrepreneur william li the cofounder of bitauto holdings which provides pricing data and other services to car dealers in china press reports say the privately held person company has raised nearly  billion besides san jose where employees focus on user interfaces it has major offices in munich for auto design and london the hub for its highperformance electric race car this interview has been edited for length and clarity q you could have had any job in silicon valley why this one a i wanted to go somewhere where a whole industry is at the point of changing i thought of transportation and education — both had tech at their periphery not the center then i met william he wanted someone to start a us company that would be part of his parent company it sounded exciting so i jumped in q what is your vision of nio’s product a i think of the car of the future as a robot that looks like a beautiful highperformance car fundamentally cars haven’t changed in the past  or  years other than improvements in fuel efficiency or adding a little more technology most people are ok with their cars but they hate the time they spend in traffic and commuting we want to give people their freedom and time back photo courtesy nio nio built its  million ep allelectric race car to show that electric cars could be superhighperformance vehicles the ep which has a top speed of  mph broke world records on tracks in germany and france in  nio built its  million ep allelectric race car to show that q how will you do that a we are making car  we want to make the car your living space and your companion it should talk to you and understand your needs q most companies making autonomous cars expect to deploy them through a ridehailing service but you plan to sell directly to consumers why a a car is a very aspirational product for many people it’s an extension of their personal space i leave my water bag gym clothes in certain places in my car when we have autonomous vehicles they can be even more an extension of space like another room or your office q what is your timeline and what level of autonomy will you offer a in  we will have vehicles for sale in china they probably will be level  see box in the us market we will have a level  car in  q when do you anticipate full autonomy with no driver controls a the technology will probably advance fast enough to get rid of the steering wheel and pedals sooner but regulations and people’s views will delay the adoption cars with no steering wheels or pedals around  to  q how will autonomous cars change our world a i think the impact will be bigger than the shift to the mobile internet and smartphones the autonomous vehicle becomes a platform for commerce and content you’ll be watching videos and movies in the car there’s a chance for new ad revenue you’ll be more productive actually working in the car we won’t need parking lots people can move away from crowded urban centers live in the countryside and work in the city when the commute becomes a pleasure instead of a pain the insurance industry will change as will vehicle repair q where will you manufacture a consumer vehicles for the china market will be made in china for the us and global markets we are still pursuing different options looking at the us as a potential place to manufacture q you’re often cited as a rival to tesla who do you see as your competitors a my competition is really the internal combustion engine it’s not tesla or anyone else we need people to get comfortable with electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles q will you have a luxury price tag a we aren’t targeting just exclusive superluxury buyers we’re making something reasonably affordable as soon as the technology costs come down the vehicle costs come down we want to make lives better for millions of people around the world q why did you create the ep race car a most people think of electric vehicles as not serious cars very low speed something to run errands we wanted to break that myth and show you can have amazing performance building an electric vehicle that broke world records established our credibility more by carolyn said hightech uber vehicles back in sf — this time for mapping quanergy’s lidar sensors help autonomous cars ‘see’ around entrepreneurs thrash out future of flexible work q will you sell the ep a it’s a limited edition but we’ve gotten increasingly more interest so we’re looking at making a broader platform it’s a  million highperformance race car q you originally launched as nextev and recently rebranded as nio why change your name so early in your company’s life a nextev was about being the nextgeneration electric vehicle company we didn’t intend it to be the brand name we wanted a global brand name nio can be pronounced in every language and sounds like new day and new beginning our logo captures the vision of the company the arrow at the bottom denotes earth the semicircle at the top denotes sky we always talk about the company as blue sky coming q how does the auto industry differ from the technology world a we’re building a complicated machine that moves at high speeds people’s lives depend on it it’s a very different product experience for consumer products design and usability are as important as the technology when you build a router it’s not like a user touches it every single day or sits in it carolyn said is a san francisco chronicle staff writer email csaidsfchroniclecom twitter csaid selfdriving car levels explained the federal government and the auto industry have developed ranking systems to describe the levels of autonomouscar technology nio and other autonomousvehicle startups are targeting various kinds of autonomy in their products level zero driver performs all control functions level  driver performs most functions but a few — such as driverassist braking — are augmented by automation level  at least two of the car’s control functions can work together in automated mode — such as adaptive cruise control combined with lane centering — but the driver still must pay attention level  driver can turn over total control of the car under certain conditions with the car largely responsible for monitoring for any sudden changes to the environment driver must still be available to take control if needed level  car is capable of driving itself but has controls for humans to drive when they choose level  car

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
