state of louisiana under five governors having served from  to  though originally part of the long faction martin quarreled with governor earl kemp long during longs third term in office and long relieved martin of nearly all of his powers as secretary of state after having considered a gubernatorial bid on several occasions martin finally ran for governor in  when at sixtysix he was overshadowed by the popular incumbent democrat edwin washington edwards who easily secured a second term in retirement the conservative martin thereafter firmly antilong switched his party affiliation in  to republican to support david c treen for governor and ronald w reagan for president contents  early years and education  the louisiana election of   earl long moves against martin  martin for governor  martins obituary and legacy  references early years and educationedit martin was born in arnaudville in st landry parish to wade o martin sr and the former alice mills his grandfathers were dr gw martin and patrick mills his grandmothers were ida guilbeau martin and justine fanguy mills martin received his bachelors degree from what is now the university of louisiana at lafayette then southwestern louisiana institute in  in  he received his law degree from the louisiana state university law center in baton rouge martin sr was also an lsu alumnus on october   martin married the former juliette bonnette july  —august   martin sr was an intimate of governor and senator huey pierce long jr in  martin sr was elected to the then district  seat on the louisiana public service commission he served for twentyfour years until his death in august  after the assassination of huey long martin sr had tried to run for governor in  but was unable to mount a serious campaign martin jr was an assistant attorney general of louisiana from  he set up a law practice in baton rouge from  he ran for secretary of state against incumbent james gremillion an appointee of antilong governor sam houston jones the louisiana election of edit martin sr and jr coaxed gremillion to withdraw from the race in which gremillion had run second to wade jr gremillions exit hence made wade jr the official democratic nominee equivalent at the time to election in overwhelmingly democratic louisiana william j bill dodd a state legislator at the time of the  election wrote in his memoirs peapatch politics the earl long era in louisiana politics that a deal was made seemed evident  when gremillion wound up with a big job in wade jrs office the possibility had existed that there would have been no runoffs at all in  if the long candidate for governor lewis lovering morgan of covington in st tammany parish had decided not to pursue a second primary against jimmie davis louisiana law then allowed runoffs for the lesser constitutional office only if there was also a runoff for governor somehow the martins convinced gremillion that he would lose a runoff and that he should bow out and continue to work in the secretary of states office but under wade jr earl long later learned that his presumed allies the martins along with register of state lands lucille may grace dent and others had coaxed morgan whom dodd called an aged and somewhat senile attorney to remain in the running for governor at first morgan said that he would not challenge davis in a runoff the martins and miss grace did not expect morgan to defeat davis what they were attempting according to dodd was the defeat of earl long who was a candidate for lieutenant governor in a looming runoff against j emile verret of iberia parish earl long had led in the primary and would have become the democratic nominee for the second spot had morgan chosen not to continue the challenge to davis and while davis defeated morgan in the runoff the results were closer than many had expected earl long moves against martinedit after his  inauguration long convinced the legislature the majority of the members being long allies at the time to move against martin who was himself considered a longite by unofficial affiliation martins office was stripped of four essential duties  a separate commissioner of insurance martin was insurance commissioner and secretary of state from  would be established with rufus d hayes taking the new position until   a separate position of custodian of voting machines later called elections commissioner would be established and the secretary of state would no longer sit on the board that handled the purchase of voting machines  the secretary of state would no longer handle voter registration and  the secretary could no longer contract for and purchase printing services what duties did martin retain there were few and all of an administrative nature according to bill dodd wade jr howled and screamed and accused earl of being vindictive but seasoned politicians and those who knew the facts of the  campaign felt that little wade got what politicians usually get when they do what wade had done martin was the author of the legislation providing for the numbering of candidates on election ballots to speed voting and to provide secrecy of the ballot for illiterates he was a past president of the national association of secretaries of state and the national association of insurance commissioners over time the secretary of states office gradually regained its previous level of duties the office was modernized and improved considerably during the long tenure of a martin successor w fox mckeithen a republican who served from  when he was a democrat to his death in  however there still remains a separate insurance commissioners office martin had appointed only one assistant secretary of state his entire tenure of office from – that being joseph riley nelson of baton rouge in  martin joined a group of more conservative louisiana democrats who endorsed republican barry m goldwater for president in the contest against lyndon b johnson others who supported goldwater were caddo parish sheriff j howell flournoy of shreveport former governors sam jones and robert f kennon lieutenant governor c c taddy aycock and monroe mayor w l jack howard toward the end of his tenure martin hired sandra thompson who was later the director of the atchafalaya basin project she ran unsuccessfully for secretary of state in  martin for governoredit martin considered a gubernatorial run in  but he then pulled back to seek reelection when he realized that earl long was a strong contender that year in  martin was appointed chairman of the state radio free europe fund earlier he had been the first louisiana resident to have been president of the national association of insurance commissioners when that office had been within the umbrella of the secretary of state in  republican leader david treen tried to persuade martin who was considered a conservative within the democratic party to switch parties and run as the gop candidate for governor in  martin again declined to run for governor and instead won an eighth consecutive term as secretary of state treen in fact made the first of his three gubernatorial races that year the names wade o martin jr and louisiana secretary of state had become synonyms in the bayou state or at the least there was a strong year connection martin finally ran for governor in  after which time he had decided to retire as secretary of state edwin edwards faced two democrats that year martin and state senator robert g bob jones of lake charles son of former governor sam jones edwards prevailed with ease  votes  percent bob jones ran second with  votes  percent martin ran a weak third with  ballots  percent both jones and martin got some unofficial republican backing in the gubernatorial election and jones was considered a possible candidate for  thereafter both jones and martin became republicans but neither sought office again two democrats pj mills a banker and a former state representative from shreveport and state senator paul j hardy of st martinville contested martins seat in the  general election hardy prevailed by some twenty thousand votes over another democrat p j mills martin was thirty and married when the united states entered world war ii but he did not enlist dodd a world war ii veteran said he believed that martins failure to serve may have been a reason that he did not attempt to run earlier for governor of course nonmilitary service did not necessarily hurt earl long whom dodd flatly claimed in his memoir was a draft dodger in world war i martins obituary and
