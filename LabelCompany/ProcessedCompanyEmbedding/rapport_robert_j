jr graham menu close homepublishingwhat is rapport robert jr graham author of the award winning science fiction series seventh journey check out roberts books by clicking here  roberts books what is rapport by zeetu in publishing tweet pin it rapport is the key for success in sales sales are down and money is tight sales professionals are finding themselves tripping over each other as they pursue an evershrinking client pool too often they are focused on using cheap tactics to make the sale sales success is not about well delivered presentations price wars or slick closing techniques nor does superior product knowledge alone win the day sales is about relationships people purchase from individuals they know like and trust this is the essence of rapport what is rapport rapport is the deepest level of relationship between two individuals in business which involves sharing common ground and is established when harmony and accord have been reached between both parties this does not mean the individuals involved agree on every issue it means they have attained a mutual respect for each other’s opinions how can i apply rapport in sales rapport mastery is the possession of skills and the genuine desire to develop relationships of mutual trust and emotional affinity the operative words here are genuine desire there is no place in rapport mastery for surface level tricks such as mimicking behaviors for the sake of manipulating unsuspecting people rapport mastery works best when adopted as a life style it is to be used as a way of dealing with people and doing business at all times not merely to manipulate others with surface techniques or to be saved until there is a glaring problem rapport mastery involves personal transparency as well as enthusiasm for the success of others helping a client find a solution to a problem or fulfill a need may be involved in seeing another’s success become a reality how quickly can i expect to attain rapport with someone if you browse the internet you will find headlines such as “create rapport in seconds” isn’t it like the ‘microwave generation’ to expect instant results that require little or no effort and time look again at the definition of rapport mastery can you actually trust or have deep affinity for someone in a few seconds although each of us naturally ‘gels’ with a certain type of individual there is no way to create this level of trust and regard for another person outside of the test of time creating rapport is a step by step process how do i know that i have reached this level of relationship with another individual unless you have been living alone on the moon your whole life you have probably established rapport with several individuals for instance has anyone every asked your opinion about a movie video game job opportunity or restaurant has anyone ever inquired of you to refer a doctor dentist attorney private school or church individuals who have sought your advice are those with whom you have established rapport list their names here         these are the individuals with whom you have created rapport they ask for your opinion because they know like and trust you once you have established rapport with a client they will purchase from you repeatedly and will provide you with quality referrals take a look at the names above have you sold to them have they been added them to you prospect list if not i highly recommend it these are the individuals who are primed to purchase from you as you go through your week you will probably think of others you may add do so and make those sales calls soon rapport is the key but it does not happen overnight rapport is a process that requires time patience and a genuine interest in helping your client rather than just selling to them focus on developing rapport and watch your sales increase dawn pici is a sales trainer and business strategist who is a certified master trainer in the disc model of human behavior coauthor of
