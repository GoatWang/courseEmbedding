new tools to help them introduce children — ages eight to  and up — to opportunities available through a knowledge of science technology engineering and math stem one trend catching on is through innovative toys that are fun to use as well as educational as kids engage in creative stemrelated play activities “when instructors try to explain circuitry principles or conduct experiments in class students are initially interested but often become disengaged” said nate macdonald he and cofounder john schuster formed tenka labs to fill a need for a compelling and challenging approach to teaching circuitry and stem topics to children the company closed a  million seed round of funding in february “we have observed what happens when basic electronic materials are put in front of kid to see what they do with them when teaching aids are intuitive enough for them to figure out they start by tinkering remain focused and invent unique things as they handassemble functioning systems with moving parts on their own” the goal is to make stem education more accessible based on this premise these two marin county educators displayed an early design model at the maker faire bay area in 0 the same year they launched their startup initially called ignited the company name was changed to tenka labs in 0 “tenka” is a japanese word that means “ignited” ceo macdonald a mechanical engineer previously taught math science and robotics at the whitehall middle school in fairfax chief design officer schuster was part of the it department in the ross valley school district where he hosted “lunch and learn” events to teach kids circuitry both left their jobs to pursue their dream of finding the best edtech toys for understanding circuitry and how they work the founders are also stem educators and first lego coaches “we studied existing electronic kits but felt that no product could engage young learners and teach basic electronics literacy in a way that would be embraced by students hold their interest and bring their creations to life so we decided to make our own” macdonald said inspired in part by simple circuit blocks at the san francisco exploratorium they designed a prototype that was five times larger using a laser cutter and d printing technology after making 0 revisions macdonald and schuster refined their crude model into what they call circuit cubes macdonald said that today’s “transformer age” kids are fascinated when one thing can be turned into another circuit cube electronic building blocks have a small form factor and can be integrated with legostyle blocks or any materials that kids can imagine from vintage toys to recycled milk cartons the transparent circuit cube design enables kids to see the connections they make when they light an led power a motor or activate a switch cubes can be used vertically horizontally or diagonally to accommodate any design with only six employees supported by  consultants tenka lab’s founders are now in the process of launching three new circuit cubebased products scheduled to ship in august they include a whacky wheels kit bright lights kit and a smart art kit each available for 99 in future a la carte extra parts

battery and a circuit cube to make a butterfly with flapping wings we’re changing the way kids learn and create”
