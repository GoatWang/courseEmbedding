new selflacing shoe innovation which it calls adaptive lacing is more than a gimmick it has potential to represent a major new platform in athletic footwear even more it highlights the companys culture of relentlessly innovating and leading heres what investors need to know about the new innovation  and why it matters nike hyperadapt  image source nike introducing hyperadapt  innovation at nike is not about dreaming of tomorrow its about accelerating toward it said nike shoe designer tinker hatfield in a post about the new innovation on the companys website were able to anticipate the needs of athletes because we know them better than anybody sometimes we deliver a reality before others have even begun to imagine it nikes new hyperadapt  platform for adaptive lacing certainly fits into the definition of an innovation ahead of its time the technology works simply when a foot is placed in the shoe the heel will hit a sensor triggering laces to automatically tighten buttons on each side enable athletes to loosen or tighten the automatic fit you can adjust it until its perfect explained nike senior innovator tiffany beers who is the projects technical lead the micro adjustments enabled by the shoe will make possible a precise fit that couldnt be achieved by lacing them the traditional way nike detailed the importance of these microadjustments for hatfield the innovation solves another enduring athleteequipment quandary the ability to make swift microadjustments undue pressure caused by tight tying and slippage resulting from loose laces are now relics of the past precise consistent personalized lockdown can now be manually adjusted on the fly thats an important step because feet undergo an incredible amount of stress during competition he says further into the future the company envisions this automatic lacing platform evolving into one providing tailoredtothemoment custom fit in which the shoe senses what the body needs and makes adjustments in realtime a culture of innovation nikes move to launch hyperadapt is worth investor attention not only could innovations like these serve to drive sales and help the company maintain its pricing power but  perhaps more importantly  it highlights nikes view of further runway in footwear overall with automatic lacing the company is completely breaking the rules of one of historys most important elements of footwear and its making shoes more important in achieving an athletic edge image source nike to drive home just how important this innovation is and how representative it is of the way the company thinks about footwear beers emphasized that its not just a product  its a platform further defining what beers meant by platform she said it is something that helps envision a world in which product changes as the athlete changes or as hatfield said in the companys post about the new platform in the future product will come alive hyperadapt is likely just a baby step in what will become a long and important evolution of the continual marriage of footwear and technology any key innovation for the company in footwear is important news for nike investors footwear is the companys largest segment accounting for about  of revenue  its the companys drive to set standards in footwear that has got the company to where it is today and its this edge that will keep it leading the industry for
