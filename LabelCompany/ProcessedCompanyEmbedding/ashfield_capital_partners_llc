that potential and therefore the greatest driver of stock prices the future is growth economies and markets expand over time driven by powerful demographic social and technological forces that foster changes in consumer habits increase productivity and generate new opportunities for companies and industries as they evolve from groundswells to mainstream movements and finally create a new status quo these trends affect economic sectors industries and companies of all sizes the best companies leverage growth trends companies that are involved in the genesis of trends small and midcaps or
