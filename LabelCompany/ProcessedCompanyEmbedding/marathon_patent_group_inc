nominally aimed at stopping abusive litigation but the architects of sweeping legislative changes to patent law haven’t considered all the risks any efforts to address problems with patent litigation should be narrowly crafted to target only abusers and not inventors there are far fewer abusers of the system than legitimate inventors whose innovation promotes job creation and economic growth     send a letter     tweet at congress act now patents matter why does this matter for more than  years our patent system has fueled america as a leader in innovation we need to protect inventors universities innovators startups research institutions incubators and small businesses whose incentive to keep innovating would disappear if they can’t prevent large companies or foreign competitors from stealing their ideas inventions are often the results of years of hard work and expensive research and development inventors rely on strong patents to protect their ideas and their livelihood weakening our patent system will…undermine job creation in the us weaken our competitive edge in the global marketplace reduce investor confidence – thus weakening our economy who does this affect we

save the inventor act now patents matter what’s the problem the movement to overhaul the patent system is nominally aimed at stopping abusive litigation but the architects of sweeping legislative changes to patent law haven’t considered all the risks any efforts to address problems with patent litigation should be narrowly crafted to target only abusers and not inventors there are far fewer abusers of the system than legitimate inventors whose innovation promotes job creation and economic growth     send a letter     tweet at congress act now patents matter why does this matter for more than  years our patent system has fueled america as a leader in innovation we need to protect inventors universities innovators startups research institutions incubators and small businesses whose incentive to keep innovating would disappear if they can’t prevent large companies or foreign competitors from stealing their ideas inventions are often the results of years of hard work and expensive research and development inventors rely on strong patents to protect their ideas and their livelihood weakening our patent system will…undermine job creation in the us weaken our competitive edge in the global marketplace reduce investor confidence – thus weakening our economy who does this affect we need to protect inventors universities innovators startups research institutions incubators and
