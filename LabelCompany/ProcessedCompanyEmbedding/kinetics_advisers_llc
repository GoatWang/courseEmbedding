york llc are wholly owned subsidiaries of kinetic advisors llc   k capital is required by us securities regulations to develop a business continuity plan bcp in order to be able to continue conducting business in the event of a significant disruption or disaster we are also required to provide this summary disclosure statement to potential clients of k capital so that they know our risk mitigation strategy in the event of an interruption to our daily conduct of business as the timing and frequency of disasters and disruptions are both unpredictable we may exercise flexibility in responding to actual events as they occur   k capitals bcp is aimed at responding to a significant business disruption sbd by protecting its employees and assets assessing its financial and operational capability and rapidly instituting recovery measures to resume operations—and therefore allow our customers to conduct business as soon as possible—while protecting the firms books and records the bcp is intended to comply with the mandates found in finra rule    our bcp anticipates two kinds of sbds internal and external internal sbds affect only our firms ability to communicate and do business such as a disastrous event that would occur within our business premises external sbds prevent the operation of the securities markets or a number of firms such as a terrorist attack or a widescale regional disruption our response to an external sbd relies more heavily on other organizations and systems and other entities with which we have agreements our firm does not maintain custody of clients funds or securities   in the event of an sbd either external or internal k capital has established an ordered dependency list and will begin immediately communicating relevant information with our clients employees critical business constituents critical banks critical counterparties and securities regulators the communication options we will employ may include email telephony mobile and fixed line us postal mail service and our website   missioncritical systems are defined by k capital accordingly in the bcp and all missioncritical systems are backed up with at least one copy stored offsite in the event of an sbd these backups will be obtained and restored as needed to continue conducting business   despite our efforts to create an ideal bcp and therefore be able to address an sbd with a greater degree of preparation we acknowledge the unpredictable nature of disasters and the impossibility of anticipating every possible catastrophic scenario we are confident that our measures will allow us to continue conducting business with minimum impact to our clients and business partners however the possibility of an adverse effect to our operations by a third partys beyond our knowledge and control inability to cope with the sbd cannot be totally disregarded homeour professionalscontact usbusiness continuity planprivacy policyterms and conditionssitemap   kinetic
