id like to turn the call over to raj murugesan shanmugaraj good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our first earnings call as a public company for those of you new to acacia i’d like to start out with a brief overview of the company the markets we serve and our growth strategy following the overview i will discuss our recent achievements and then turn it over to john gavin our cfo who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance and outlook acacia’s mission is to deliver highspeed optical interconnects that transform cloud content and communication networks we have developed a family of highspeed interconnects that leverage our own digital signal processor or dsp asic and silicon based photonic integrated circuit or pic our dsp asic has over a billion transistors and our pic collapses over  photonic functions significantly reducing the cost and size of optical interconnects our products enable industryleading speed density and power efficiency this level of innovation and integration is only possible because we have developed both our dsp asic and pic in silicon this siliconization causes disruption at multiple levels but primarily helps web  content providers and traditional service providers build fiberoptic networks at lower cost while increasing network capacity substantially to meet the bandwidth demand for video mobile cloud computing and other high bandwidth drivers like iot our family of standard interconnect modules can be easily integrated into traditional network equipment like dwdm boxes as well as routers data center switches or custom equipment being built by the web  content providers our modules reduce the overall cost and complexity of building and managing high speed networks we offer  gigabit per second and  gigabit per second products today and are working on products that enable speeds up  terabit per second and more the market opportunity we are targeting is large and growing the growth in bandwidth demand has caused an increase in investments across longhaul metro and interdata center networks with most of that investment focused on speeds up g and higher with the growth of large data centers and content moving closer to the consumer we are seeing strong demand for our products across metro and interdata center networks geographically we are seeing demand across all regions while demand from china is particularly strong our customer base has grown from eight customers in  to more than  customers in the first half of  we have seen substantial increases in customer revenue in the past four years from our original eight customers they have increased both the volume and the number of products they purchased from us and we believe we will see similar increases from our newer customers going forward our growth is being driven by strong global demand from metro and interdata center network buildouts we believe that the industry is in the early stages of a multiyear buildout cycle of g g and g technology these buildouts are happening in longhaul including submarine and in metro and interdata center networks in the second quarter we saw a step function increase in demand driven by deployments in all of our growth markets we started to see this demand increase beginning late in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter which enabled us to achieve a revenue growth rate of  yearoveryear in the first half of  we expect similar growth to continue into the second half of  during the second quarter total revenues grew to  million an increase of  yearoveryear driven primarily by an increase in sales of our g cfp digital coherent optics or cfpdco products as well as the ramp of our new g product family at the same time we recorded nongaap net income in the second quarter of  million compared to  million in the second quarter of  these results demonstrate the strength of both our business and operating leverage in our model we continue to lead the industry in delivering next generation products is our cfpdco shipments which in the second quarter exceeded  units also as we previously reported we began sampling our cfp analog coherent optics or cfpaco in the first quarter of  in  we began to see the majority of our revenues shift from longhaul to metro and interdata center applications we also continue to make progress on diversifying our revenue base for example the second quarter two of our newer tier customers who are not in our original group of eight customer substantially increased their spending with us and moved up on to the top five customer group as they ramp their interdata center and metro buildouts our second quarter highlights also include the completion of our ipo in which we raised  million in net proceeds and we added vincent roche ceo of analog devices to our board vincent brings a wealth of industry knowledge and experience which further enhances the public company leadership capability of our board in summary we are very pleased with our strong financial performance and our ability to quickly scale to meet growing customer demand our success is a testament to the strength of our disruptive technology and execution from our talented employees we have built a unique multi disciplinary team which provides us a significant competitive advantage in solving the optical interconnect problem we are also very excited about the many opportunities ahead of us and the magnitude of the tectonic shift we believe we are driving in the industry our disruptive technology has already started to transform cloud content and communication networks and we feel this is just the beginning we planned to continue to invest in our rd organization to introduce additional market leading products with that ill turn the call over to john for a more detailed review of our financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter john gavin thanks raj and good afternoon everyone as raj mentioned i am john gavin cfo of acacia and today i will walk you through our financial and operating performance for the second quarter of  and will provide our outlook for the third quarter before opening up the call to questions we are excited to report our first quarter as a public company and i am very pleased that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board total revenue of  million for the second quarter of  rose  from revenue of  million in the second quarter of  this growth was driven by continued strong global demand for metro and interdata center network buildouts with particularly strong demand from the china market thanks to the efforts of our operations in rd teams we are able to ramp additional production capacity to meet the strong customer demand we saw increased demand for products that contain a vertically integrated silicon pic technology and we have scaled our production capacity to better meet that demand in particular we saw increased demand for our metro focused g cfp dco and our g interdata center focused products we continue to execute on our objective to diversify our revenue base revenue from customers outside our original eight customers grew  yearoveryear and  sequentially compared to  yearoveryear and  sequential growth for our original eight customers nongaap gross margins rose to  in the second quarter of  from  in the second quarter of  this increase is primarily due to the continued shift in our revenue mix to products that contain our vertically integrated silicon pic technology combined with our progress on transitioning our manufacturing to lower cost regions during the second quarter we also began to ramp our g products which utilize our silicon pic technology our gross margin can fluctuate based on quarterly product mix the introduction of new products and the impact of pricing changes over the longterm we expect nongaap gross margins to improve driven by further vertical integration into our silicon building blocks and our ongoing focus on reducing manufacturing costs over the longterm we expect nongaap gross margins to be in line with our longterm target range of  to  total nongaap operating expenses for the quarter were  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenues during the second quarter of  rd expenses totaled  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the second quarter of  the increase in rd expenses was primarily related to a increases in personnel costs and cost that support our next generation silicon development for both dsp asic and pic technology we expect fluctuations in our quarterly rd expenses due to the timing of silicon development costs and the associated development expenses to prototype and qualified new technology developments we continue to invest in our technology roadmap and we are making progress with the roadmap products that will come to market during the  and  sga expenses were  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the second quarter of  we continued to add to our sales and marketing efforts to support new and existing customer growth and in the second quarter we expand that our direct sales force with sales engineering support and customer facing resources we also have increased our ga resources to address the additional scale of our business and to meet the requirements of being a publicly traded company we plan to continue to expand our rd and sga organizations as we scale the business to support the many growth opportunities ahead of us over the longterm we expect nongaap rd and nongaap sga to increase as a percentage of revenue to be in line with our longterm target range of  to  and  to  respectively nongaap operating income for the second quarter was  million or  of revenue up from  million or  of revenue in the second quarter of  our nongaap results exclude  million of stockbased compensation expense due to the step function increase in our revenue during the second quarter revenue growth far exceeded our ability to scale our planned investments in rd and sales and marketing over the longterm we expect our nongaap operating margins to be in line with our longterm target range of  to  adjusted ebitda was  million in the second quarter up from  million in the second quarter of  driven by our expanded gross profit on the yearoveryear incremental revenue and the operating leverage inherent in our business model our nongaap effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately  down from  in the second quarter of  a principal international operating entity continue to make progress in the second quarter in addition we have achieved our initial objectives of establishing our operations in ireland and having our team there be a critical aspect of our global customer and operations support model over the longterm we expect that our nongaap effective tax rate will be in line with a longterm target range of  to  overall we recorded nongaap net income in the second quarter of  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the second quarter of  based on a fullydiluted weighted average share count of  million shares this translates to nongaap diluted earnings of  per share we expect that nongaap net income as a percent of revenue will be in line with our longterm target range of  to  now turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million which included net proceeds from the ipo of  million and we have no debt we generated  million of cash from operating activities in the second quarter we are very encouraged by the continued strong demand for our products across our customer base coming out of the second quarter which provides us with good visibility to our business in the third quarter this ongoing demand is led by the same market drivers we saw in the second quarter namely growth driven by continued strong global demand from metro and interdata center network buildouts with customers of our legacy products now migrating to our next generation silicon pic products with that i would like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of  as raj previously stated we achieved yearoveryear growth of  in the first half of  we expect to see similar growth continue into the second half of  with some history of seasonality in the fourth quarter with that being said as noted in our earnings release in the third quarter of  we expect total revenue to be between  million and  million nongaap net income to be in the range of  million to  million and nongaap diluted earnings in the range of  to  per share based on anticipated  million diluted shares outstanding in wrapping up my comments the second quarter was an exciting and busy quarter for acacia all across the company we exceeded our financial and operating expectations and strengthened our balance sheet to the completion of our ipo we see continued strength in the major demand drivers of our business and believe they are well positioned to take advantage of those growth opportunities i will now turn the call back to rob to open up the call for questions after which raj will wrap up with some summary remarks questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question is coming from the line of vijay bharadwaj with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions vijay bharadwaj yes thanks hi raj john solid results here congratulations to your team my question is help us – give us an anchor on how we should look at end market growth and demand which would help us to better model the business into next year so you mentioned strength in metro and also in data center interconnects give us any numbers any quantitative feel you can on those end markets and then that would help us to better model the business heading into next year thanks murugesan shanmugaraj so vijay im going to take a crack at it and have benny also add to it so if you look at the market segments that we participate in which is the longhaul and the metro and the interdata center markets and we talked about this a little bit in our s it’s a little complicated to model it exactly but collectively these three according to acg are over  billion in  moving to over  billion in  and so these are growing but these are customer network equipment revenue numbers and not specifically our addressable state but if you look at our addressable states within theirs we share a significant portion of the interdata center markets where our products play pretty well and we also have a good participation in the metro markets and so if you look at just our own addressable market is in the  billion to  billion and growing is what we can say so it is a little dynamic it is a little difficult to model exactly because it’s multiple markets product segments and we sell into the service providers – equipment providers space which participate in that and our addressable market is a little lower than those numbers vijay bharadwaj perfect a quick followup for john john on sales opex in opex overall how should we think about it through the rest of the year would you be allocating opex for these cloud customers like dedicated sales force because youre seeing strength there obviously thanks john gavin sure vijay in terms of overall operating expense were only – were not guiding out for the followon quarters but in terms of just overall direction we wouldnt necessarily per se dedicated sales resources what were doing is we’re supplementing our teams with both customer technical support resources and incremental customer facing resources so there isnt really a notion of having dedication in our sales structure but we are making investments there as you see our business is scaling quite rapidly so were making those associated adjustments over time to scale up those organizations but not really in a mode of dedicating a specialty sales team if you will it’s just augmenting the resources that we have vijay bharadwaj excellent yes thank you again and solid results john gavin thanks vijay murugesan shanmugaraj thank you vijay operator our next question is coming from the line of alex henderson with needham please proceed with your questions alex henderson some quarter guys couple of simple stuff can you just give us the ending headcount john gavin yes alex this is john thank you for your comment ending headcount was  at the end of q alex henderson and on the tax rate just quickly i know youre planning on having it come down to  but how rapidly does that trend down john gavin so the tax rate alex were in the early aspects of the establishment of the restructuring that we did back in starting in q so well see that rate fluctuate a little bit over time but as you saw the nongaap rate was  for the quarter so were going to move up and down a little bit variably in the tax rate as that structure settles in and becomes more steady state over the period of time but you can think about it in that  to  range for sure is what weve given for guidance alex henderson okay one question on the technology side can you give us some sense of where you are testing the aco product with other peoples dsp other than your own and how long do you think that that will take to reach fruition so that we can get some sense of the timing of that murugesan shanmugaraj so alex ill take a crack at it and then i’ll let benny extrapolate on it so as you know we sampled the aco back early in the first quarter and weve gone after a few select opportunities in terms of testing it out and so thats the phase we are in if you look at our own projections we plant ramping this product late in the year in q and if you look at the total revenue projections the aco is not a material portion of the revenue at this stage and maybe benny you want to add to it benny mikkelsen yes first before answering the question i’d like to introduce myself my name is benny mikkelsen i’m cto and founder of acacia so as raj pointed out we started sampling our aco in late first quarter this year but with the plant ramping – and i think in north hemis acacia is uniquely positioned to participate in both aco and dco market and as raj pointed out we shipped more than  dco modules through this year and consequently shipping a lot more dco than acos and we also believe that  the dco market is expected to be significantly higher than the aco market is also an agreement we like counting however we cant speak  make specific customer big announcement but we see good traction on aco and we believe this is also going to be an important part for our next year alex henderson if i could just ask one last question you obviously had a lot of conversations with people out of china can you give us some sense of where you think people are in china with respect to new rfps that could be left in the remainder of the year and update us on where zte is relative to the issues around that government issue thank you murugesan shanmugaraj yes so alex again as you heard in some of the other calls china is in a cycle of a multiyear expansion of g g and g started out late last year with the backbone network from one carrier namely china mobile that went through all through the q and into q we are seeing more activity in the provincial networks of china mobile as well its not going to be as we the backbone but it’s going to be significant and we see activity happening in those networks through the second half of this year and to the first half next year were also hearing about the tenders from the other two carriers china unicom telecom as well and so in the nearterm we see the g g expansion happening in those three carriers now as some alluded as well theres the  fiveyear plan from the chinese government that was released that talks about the expansion of broadband all the way from the access to the backbone from  to  thats should cover through the midterm of the expansion and again as they are adding more access capacity adding more mobile capacity we see this is a multiyear expansion and so were in the early innings of that so thats part one of the question you asked in terms of zte as you know zte is consistently one of the top five equipment providers in the world and were happy to have them as a big customer of ours as theyve demonstrated theyre working through the us commerce issues and we believe that theyre going to put the issues behind them and looking forward to working with them as we move forward alex henderson so nice super size opportunity there thank you murugesan shanmugaraj thank you alex operator our next question is from the line of tal liani with bank of america please proceed with your question tal liani hi guys i have more zte specific questions and also gross margin what was the contribution of china ill just shoot a few questions and then we can discuss what was the contribution of china this quarter percentage wise and then did you provide your number one customer what was the contribution also percentage i know you provided growth with original eight customers versus others because of the issues with zte im trying to isolate zte and then another question on zte was entering the quarter you had backlog of  million you disclosed it before attributed specifically to zte did you draw on this backlog or did it go up this quarter and final question is about the gross margin the gross margin this quarter we see similar behavior of q where there was a growth in proportion of dsps that drove up the gross margin its about a year early on the plan and im wondering how should we think about the gross margin what drove the increase in the gross margin and is it sustainable are you seeing the benefits of what you were supposed to see next year are you seeing the benefit this year or is it mostly because of higher proportion of dsp that is temporary and should reverse back and then grow next year for the reasons you highlighted before sorry i know many questions in different directions but i just wanted to bring this up murugesan shanmugaraj so we will try to address one by one tal although you may have to repeat the last couple but on the  lets start with the zte and the contribution so if you look at what we had in the q zte as you know in q was pretty large  revenue and that was because of the backbone buildouts and then in q they dropped down to  so its lower so we had the other customers move up in terms of backlog we see continued strong backlog as well from zte going into the rest of the year so we dont see a whole lot of slowdown if thats what youre getting at in terms of backlog coming from zte or growth prospects for them in terms of expansion so just jumping into the gross margin im going to take a little crack at it and turn it over to john gross margin as you pointed out depends on multiple factors it depends on our own vertical integration which includes the mix shift of our replacing our legacy products with more or vertically integrated pic products it also involves shipping dsps but and of course we are moving to a low cost region in terms of cm and i would say that we are not near the top of any of those transitions yet weve had a mix of those where weve done a little bit of all of those things and im going to let john expand on that but it is something that has moved in because of the mix shift but i think theres still additional opportunities we see john gavin sure thanks raj so i think to add a little bit more color to what raj was saying in gross margin i think for sure in the second quarter versus the first quarter the incremental revenue that we saw that was really coming pretty much  from the pic base products so as you know were getting a much better gross margin there because of the integration into our pic technology that was one factor also q was really the first quarter where we really did a big pivot and shift of our contract manufacturing moving that out from north america and into the far east lower cost regional contract manufacturing plants that also gave us another bump in gross margin so i think you know as i said in my remarks well have some fluctuation quartertoquarter in our gross margin i dont see it being in wide fluctuation points like maybe you would see between q and q but certainly factors like second half pricing now start to kick in from a pricing perspective and those types of things will impact our margin so i think where a little ahead of where we would be in terms of our plans for gross margin expansion which is good but i wouldnt expect that its going to be substantially higher than that going forward tal liani so just a followup on your last comment that means i mean all the reasons you noted are basically next year reasons that are being materialized now so that means we should not expect – just hypothetically speaking we shouldnt expect gross margin to go back to where it was last quarter in the following quarters is this sustainable what youre seeing now was gross margin john gavin correct i’d say that – as i said the variability is not going to be as wide as the q to q swing but we will see variability in the gross margin rate and as i said in my remarks the target we still have for the longterm we still believe that’s accurate  to  in terms of where were going to be longterm tal liani got it thank you john gavin sure no problem operator our next question is from the line of tim savageaux with northland capital please proceed with your question timothy savageaux hi good afternoon and my congratulations as well on a great quarter i wanted to ask – it looks like at least from a sequential standpoint while china remains strong for you and grew a bit on a yearoveryear basis real standout was growth in the us and i want to focus in on that for a moment im going to assume that the sort of focus of a lot of the cloud data center interconnect activity i wonder if you might be able to sort of frame your direct and indirect kind of engagement with the cloud players sort of is that getting to be material piece of your revenue it looks like it is and sort of along with that i think you mentioned some new perhaps us based oems moving into the top five i wonder if you can talk about whether – and this is going touching the gross margin issue as well whether there is some sales of just coherent asics there the whole modules are how that overall kind of cloud business looks both with the service providers and their traditional equipment suppliers thanks murugesan shanmugaraj yes tim thats a good question again i’ll take a crack at this and let john elaborate on this but youre right in terms of just the growth itself i would not classify this as just one customer or two but it’s – original eight customers they grew sequentially  as we said as opposed to the eight customers grew only  sequentially from q to q but we do see a lot of activity and there is a lot of growth that we saw coming from the data center interdata center networks and our products are deployed in several of these interdata center networks but again as we said before as a policy we’re not going to talk about individual customers other than the ones we list as the  customers in our q so we are happy to see a couple of the tier customers move into and the growth is coming both from interdata center as well as the metro networks timothy savageaux okay go ahead i’m sorry murugesan shanmugaraj john do you have anything to add john gavin yes im just going to add to that from what raj said a little bit in terms of the ship location keep in mind that ship location for us is going to be where our product is shipped to so sometimes that cannot be where the end product ends up from our final customer perspective so just wanted to keep that in mind but raj is correct i think the north america shift is definitely from the growth that weve discussed on our prepared remarks around not only the interdata center market but for the metro market as well so metro as most people have seen is in a buildout cycle that’s globally and has picked up certainly from the north america perspective in terms of where some of those customers were seeing increases in demand in q also a little bit of a longhaul exposure in north america specifically in the subsea aspect of the marketplace timothy savageaux okay great and any comments on the kind of asic versus module kind of business model or margin driver is that sort of a material thing to discuss right now or is it principally dco modules going into all your major customers murugesan shanmugaraj yes i think its a latter term i think its really the dco driver is really whats predominant in our revenue structure versus components and that is driving it in terms of the revenue growth both in metro and interdata center timothy savageaux i can just throw one quick followup in their i wondered if you can address from a competitive standpoint that does look like youre picking up some share here but to what extent the strength and you mentioned  gigabits plus a lot of thats enabled by the advanced modulation technologies qam and up among them but if you could talk about kind of advanced modulation has a competitive factor in the marketplace and whether you see that as an advantage for acacia murugesan shanmugaraj yes tim so ill take a crack at this and benny will elaborate little bit but if you look at the growth segments that we see which is the metro and dci market we have a unique combination of our low power high performance dsps which are ideally suited for those market segments and integrated with our low cost silicon optics and this combination in a module provides significant advantages to customers in those two market segments so that’s primarily the driver for us growing share ourselves there is competition that you would see in some individual segments but as benny pointed out as well we are unique in being able to do the dco as well as the aco that gives us ability to move into taking share benny do you have any other comments benny mikkelsen i think you’ve mentioned clear answer murugesan shanmugaraj okay nothing more tim on that timothy savageaux okay thanks very much i will pass it on murugesan shanmugaraj thanks tim operator our next question is from the line of paul silverstein with cowen and company please proceed with your questions paul silverstein thanks guys i just want to clarify something the guidance who gave is that similar to when you kicked off the ipo ie does not include any revenue from zte are you now factoring in second half revenue from zte murugesan shanmugaraj so paul the guidance we gave is q only and within the q number we are assuming that zte is in that number for the third quarter paul silverstein okay so you put the back in murugesan shanmugaraj okay paul silverstein secondly given the numbers you put up recognizes maybe – somewhat a silly question but i’ll ask anyway where you are at all supply constraint murugesan shanmugaraj yes so its a good question paul as you know indiscernible last year and we put in place additional capacity to scale and so one of the reasons for our q achievement was our ability to scale our cm as well to be able to meet the demand now were not caught up on that demand at this point yet we see some residual demand even in q that is not going to be satisfied because part of it is we are bringing in another cm but we are also adding additional products like as you know the ac is ramping to high volumes and then of course we have the aco products so we are in a continual move where we are bringing in new cm but also new products that makes it a little bit more challenging to meet all the demand we have but we made significant headway in meeting the demand in q and we expect in q as well paul silverstein raj correct me if i’m wrong but you guys relying on third parties for lasers correct murugesan shanmugaraj yes we do paul silverstein is that a source of meaningful constrain is that an issue now were as you look forward i know there are multiple suppliers but is that an issue murugesan shanmugaraj well so we have some great partners that we work with on supplying us with the itlas and however because as you rightly point out there is a global demand and so weve got to continually be asking them to supply more which is always a little challenge but we havent seen any serious concerns because of that because you have some very good partners that we work with on this paul silverstein all right two last quick questions related to customers one can you – john i think i heard you correctly you said your top aid you gave us the growth numbers but can you give us the absolute dollars for the contribution between the eight and the other  or the other i guess that would be   original and the nonoriginal murugesan shanmugaraj oh in q yes were not providing those kinds of breakdown metrics paul paul silverstein so you just given the growth not the dollars murugesan shanmugaraj correct paul silverstein all right and then on your  customers collectively they were  down from  and there were three of them is that correct murugesan shanmugaraj yes that sounds right yes paul silverstein and i apologize but did you tell us what they were in terms of you know how much from i know youre not naming them but can you tell us with respect to contributions were to get to the  murugesan shanmugaraj so in q it was   in  for one two and three paul silverstein and finally john can you just i forget to ask the question but going back to the you mentioned that you dont see gross margins going up meaningfully in the second half if i heard you correctly and you like to identify one or two issues can you just repeat what those issues were the offsets given that i think i heard you and raj say that with respect to each of the three drivers there was still a fair ways to go what are offsets that will keep a lid on gross margin expansion in the nearterm john gavin yes paul sure so in terms of gross margin i think one of the big drivers obviously that affects that is product mix and in that you know were seeing the legacy products that dont use our silicon photonics devices come down at a bit of an accelerated pace those customers are moving their products into the silicon based products so now we’re switching the mix of revenue a little bit harder  little bit faster to the pic based solutions and thats one of the principle drivers the other aspect is we will be getting some continued cost improvement as we ramp up in the second half to our cms in the lower cost regions but the benefit  lot of the benefit of the mix portions has been accelerated a little bit so we will have price changes coming through that that are normal for the business in the second half so you have those factors that kind of you know way in and out of gross margin calculation so we’re a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of where we thought we would be at this point in time and then until we get more vertical integration into some of the new products we expect to be around this range paul silverstein all right i will pass it on thanks guys operator the next question is from the line of the doug clark with goldman sachs please proceed with your question douglas clark great thanks a lot first question on gross margins as well youve talked a number of times now about the mix of silicon based or vertically integrated silicon products exiting  and in the first quarter of  i thought that mix was already quite high so im just wondering if you can give us an estimate as to kind of how high or how much of a percentage of the mix that is at this point and then secondarily related to gross margins on the analog cfp product thats coming out considering it doesnt have the asic dsp as well can you give us an early glimpse as to the impact to gross margins from that product murugesan shanmugaraj yes doug i will take look – take a crack at that so exiting the  part of the business so legacy products were still shipping as a higher percentage of our overall revenue in q as an example it was under  so that that mix shift is changing and a piece of that is the step function we took in revenue those were obviously mostly all of the new pic based products so you know getting more gross margin dollar contribution from those products and then seeing the percentage of the legacy products you know come under the sub range where it was in the –   range coming out end of the year john gavin and on the aco product per se doug i mean it doesnt have the dsp however it still uses our own silicon photonics pic so which has most of the value in the aco as well so were not giving exact margin numbers on each of those but thats still built on the same silicon technology douglas clark okay john gavin a lot of leverage out of that technology because its on our existing silicon photonics platforms douglas clark okay that makes sense and a followup on the aco product as well i know that youve been in sampling with customers for at least a quarter and a half competitively what type of feedback are you getting on or reception are you getting on your product versus some of the other solutions that are starting to make their way into the market as well murugesan shanmugaraj so as benny had indicated we are sampling with the few customers there is strong interest from customers and again the interest on the aco as we see is a little bit more regional where the western hemisphere we see more interest and the eastern its a lot more on dco but for the customers we are sampling we are seeing very good interest and good feedback on performance as well on plan to ramp end of the year douglas clark all right great and then final question for me youve mentioned a few times  gig and  gig recognizing that  is more targeted right now to the dci market can you give us a sense of kind of what the mix is between those two capacity speeds are at this point murugesan shanmugaraj yes we do have in our product we have the multiple modulation format qpsk qam qam and it is per application and it depends on some of the – even in the data center they use the qam modulation which is more like a longhaul link but were not breaking it down at this point dug into capacity of g versus g but the g is also in a high ramp mode and is in an over subscribe mode douglas clark all right great thanks a lot operator thank you operator instructions our next question is a followup from the line of alex henderson with needham please proceed with your question alex henderson hey so i got a couple of questions for you one have you seen any changes in the dsp development programs out of any of your competitors i’ve heard any – for instances made some progress on their dsp relative to the temperature issues have you seen any change in the landscape there and particularly within a couple of the oems that have their inhouse so if you’ve seen anything there thats allowing you to start to penetrate some of the inhouse oem opportunities murugesan shanmugaraj so alex we don’t – we are not going to go into exact details of customer and competition but again as you know weve even on a pretty good clip in terms of dsp development and weve been in several cases first to market with our dsps both for purpose built for metro versus purpose built for the longhaul and high performance and what we can say is that we continue to – as john gavin talked about we are continuing to invest in rd and maintain this clip of coming out with an asic almost every year and focused on particular segments and so we plan to keep that kind of a leadership position first to market position in dsps as well and the other point to note is that as you know starting with nanometer now nanometer going into nanometer going into nanometer these gets quite a bit more expensive each iteration of technology and somebody who has a larger and larger market share it becomes easier to amortize these developments and so we believe that this is on the right path for us to gain share with our dsps alex henderson so have you had any success in conversations with the inhouse players that have their own dsp inhouse and particularly is there any residence starting to develop around the idea that we need to go to the commercial offtheshelf chip mod approach to things as it has happened in every other industry as well as moving to an open line system architecture which has happened in every other industry are you hearing any response back from the service providers or some of the inhouse players that thats something theyre cognizant of and they are starting to anticipate i mean are they starting to think of you as maybe the broadcom of the optical component market murugesan shanmugaraj yes that’s good point right i think from – we’ve heard many times there is a lot of requirement for interoperating between multiple platforms and we among the few others provide a platform for them to be able to interoperate with each other but as i said before we are engaged in discussions alex with a few of those and we’ve had success with some but again they are not in a position to talk about them at this stage and when they come to scale we’ll certainly be able to talk in these kind of forms alex henderson could i ask another question on the aco side what percentage of the aco players that youre talking to are players that own their own dsp as opposed to players that are buying the aco from you and buying your dsp in order to minimize the faceplate utilization on their system going to a smaller form factor so that they can mount your dsp and use your aco can you talk about that mix a little bit murugesan shanmugaraj yes i’ll start and benny can add to it but as in a very new complex product integration we focused on a few customers where it’s easier to integrate and get the product into a maturity level that that we can ramp so our focus has been initially more with the costumers who had our own dsp and i dont know benny you have any other comments to add there benny mikkelsen yes i think we see both type of customers but we clearly see the majority of customers using our dsp but we clearly have an advantage of integration between our aco and dsp but we are seeing both type of customers alex henderson one last question i’ll indiscernible the floor the year end price adjustments that happened in the first quarter given how tight and constrained the environment is is that your sense that theyre likely to come in at the very low end of the historical band murugesan shanmugaraj yes i think thats a very good point alex i think historically as you seen in this industry  to  yearoveryear but of course for our constrained products we have a little bit more leverage to minimize the price drops but there is going to be some level of yearoveryear reduction which has been taken into account in our projections alex henderson and how do the social net engineers workout for you murugesan shanmugaraj as we said were not going to – were always looking for very strong people to come and work for us and so – but we dont comment on specific projects that theyre going to be working on alex henderson thanks guys end of qa operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to mr shanmugaraj for closing comments murugesan shanmugaraj thank you rob so before we end this call i would like to personally thank our customers suppliers our board of directors stockholders and most importantly the acacia team for all their support and hard work to get acacia to where we are
