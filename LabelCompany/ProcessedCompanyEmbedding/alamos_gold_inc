reliance on forwardlooking information note to us investors alamos prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in canada which differ from the requirements of us securities laws terms relating to mineral resources in this website are defined in accordance with national instrument  – standards of disclosure for mineral projects under the guidelines set out in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” permits mining companies in their filings with the sec to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce alamos may use certain terms such as “measured mineral resources” “indicated mineral resources” “inferred mineral resources” and “probable mineral reserves” that the sec does not recognize these terms may be used in this website and are included in the public filings of alamos which have been filed with the sec and the securities commissions or similar authorities in canada cautionary nongaap measures and additional gaap measures note that for purposes of this section gaap refers to ifrs the company believes that investors use certain nongaap and additional gaap measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies they are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with gaap additional gaap measures that are presented on the face of the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income include “mine operating costs” “earnings from mine operations” and “earnings from operations” these measures are intended to provide an indication of the company’s mine and operating performance “cash flow from operating activities before changes in noncash working capital” is a nongaap performance measure that could provide an indication of the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and is calculated by adding back the change in noncash working capital to “cash provided by used in operating activities” as presented on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows “free cash flow” is a nongaap performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash flows invested in mineral property plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets as presented on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows and that would provide an indication of the company’s ability to generate cash flows from its mineral projects return on equity is defined as earnings from continuing operations divided by the average total equity for the current and previous year “mining cost per tonne of ore” and “cost per tonne of ore” are nongaap performance measures that could provide an indication of the mining and processing efficiency and effectiveness of the mine these measures are calculated by dividing the relevant mining and processing costs and total costs by the tonnes of ore processed in the period “cost per tonne of ore” is usually affected by operating efficiencies and wastetoore ratios in the period “cash operating costs per ounce” “total cash costs per ounce” and “allin sustaining costs per ounce” as used in this analysis are nongaap terms typically used by gold mining companies to assess the level of gross margin available to the company by subtracting these costs from the unit price realized during the period these nongaap terms are also used to assess the ability of a mining company to generate cash flow from operations there may be some variation in the method of computation of these metrics as determined by the company compared with other mining companies in this context “cash operating costs per ounce” reflects the cash operating costs allocated from inprocess and dore inventory associated with ounces of gold sold in the period “cash operating costs per ounce” may vary from one period to another due to operating efficiencies wastetoore ratios grade of ore processed and gold recovery rates in the period “total cash costs per ounce” includes “cash operating costs per ounce” plus applicable royalties cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce are exclusive of exploration costs “allin sustaining costs per ounce” include total cash costs exploration corporate and administrative share based compensation and sustaining capital costs nongaap and additional gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies for a reconciliation of nongaap and gaap measures please refer to

accordance with national instrument  – standards of disclosure for mineral projects under the guidelines set out in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” permits mining companies in their filings with the sec to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce alamos may use certain terms such as “measured mineral resources” “indicated mineral resources” “inferred mineral resources” and “probable mineral reserves” that the sec does not recognize these terms may be used in this website and are included in the public filings of alamos which have been filed with the sec and the securities commissions or similar authorities in canada cautionary nongaap measures and additional gaap measures note that for purposes of this section gaap refers to ifrs the company believes that investors use certain nongaap and additional gaap measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies they are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with gaap additional gaap measures that are presented on the face of the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income include “mine operating costs” “earnings from mine operations” and “earnings from operations” these measures are intended to provide an indication of the company’s mine and operating performance “cash flow from operating activities before changes in noncash working capital” is a nongaap performance measure that could provide an indication of the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and is calculated by adding back the change in noncash working capital to “cash provided by used in operating activities” as presented on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows “free cash flow” is a nongaap performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash flows invested in mineral property plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets as presented on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows and that would provide an indication of the company’s ability to generate cash flows from its mineral projects return on equity is defined as earnings from continuing operations divided by the average total equity for the current and previous year “mining cost per tonne of ore” and “cost per tonne of ore” are nongaap performance measures that could provide an indication of the mining and processing efficiency and effectiveness of the mine these measures are calculated by dividing the relevant mining and processing costs and total costs by the tonnes of ore processed in the period “cost per tonne of ore” is usually affected by operating efficiencies and wastetoore ratios in the period “cash operating costs per ounce” “total cash costs per ounce” and “allin sustaining costs per ounce” as used in this analysis are nongaap terms typically used by gold mining companies to assess the level of gross margin available to the company by subtracting these costs from the unit price realized during the period these nongaap terms are also used to assess the ability of a mining company to generate cash flow from operations there may be some variation in the method of computation of these metrics as determined by the company compared with other mining companies in this context “cash operating costs per ounce” reflects the cash operating costs allocated from inprocess and dore inventory associated with ounces of gold sold in the period “cash operating costs per ounce” may vary from one period to another due to operating efficiencies wastetoore ratios grade of ore processed and gold recovery rates in the period “total cash costs per ounce” includes “cash operating costs per ounce” plus applicable royalties cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce are exclusive of exploration costs “allin sustaining costs per ounce” include total cash costs exploration corporate and administrative share based compensation and sustaining capital costs nongaap and additional gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies for a reconciliation of nongaap and gaap measures please refer to alamos’ managements’ discussion and analysis as presented on sedar and the company’s website

the company also provided  production and operating guidance we closed  on a strong note achieving full year guidance with record production of  ounces of gold in the fourth quarter the strong fourth quarter performance was driven by improved production from the high grade mill at mulatos and record production from youngdavidson where we achieved our yearend underground mining rate target of  tonnes per day said john a mccluskey president and chief executive officer through merger and acquisition capital investment and cost reduction we have built a stronger company that is better positioned to navigate the challenges of the current gold price environment as we execute on our core plan of completing the underground ramp up at youngdavidson and developing the cerro pelon and la yaqui deposits at mulatos we expect the benefits of these efforts will continue to unfold mr mccluskey added fourth quarter and full year  operating highlights achieved guidance with production of  ounces of gold in  allin sustaining costs have not been finalized but are expected to be consistent with guidance at the mine site level reported record quarterly production of  ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of  including  ounces from youngdavidson  ounces from mulatos and  ounces from el chanate increased underground mining rates to average a new record of  tonnes per day tpd in the fourth quarter at youngdavidson and over  tpd in december consistent with the yearend target achieved a new record low in terms of unit mining costs at youngdavidson of  cad per tonne benefiting from a nine

underground mining rates underground grades averaged  grams per tonne of gold gt au in the fourth quarter and  gt au for the full year consistent with the mineral reserve grade of  gt au underground mining rates averaged a new record of  tpd in the fourth quarter and over  tpd in december consistent with guidance the mill operated at an average of  tpd in the fourth quarter with lower grade open pit stockpiled ore supplementing the higher grade underground ore feed the increase in underground mining rates drove the processed grade higher to average  gt au in the fourth quarter and  gt au for the full year recoveries averaged  in the fourth quarter and  for the full year for the full year youngdavidson produced  ounces of gold consistent with guidance and up from  ounces in  the increase reflected higher underground mining rates and recoveries mulatos mulatos produced  ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of  up  from  ounces in the third quarter reflecting the recovery of deferred production from the seasonally weak third quarter and a strong improvement from the high grade mill the open pit heap leach operation at mulatos continued to perform well in the quarter with grades stacked on the leach pad of  gt au well above the full year guidance of  gt au for the full year stacked grades averaged  gt au again above the full year budget combined total throughput rates averaged  tpd in the quarter consistent with the budget and up sharply from the third quarter reflecting the end of the rainy season and higher mill throughput the mill operated at improved throughput rates of  tpd in the quarter driving the strong increase in high grade production for the full year mulatos produced  ounces of gold below full year guidance reflecting the slower commissioning of the mill el chanate el chanate produced  ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of  down from  ounces in the third quarter though up from  ounces in the fourth quarter of  this closed off a record year at el chanate with production of  ounces of gold exceeding guidance of  to  ounces the operation generated positive free cash flow in  in a challenging gold price environment reflecting disciplined cost control  guidance alamos core focus in  is on lowering costs and capital spending while continuing the ramp up at youngdavidson and expansion at mulatos the company expects to produce between  and  ounces of gold in  at substantially lower costs and capital spending levels allin sustaining costs are expected to decrease to  per ounce of gold sold driven by an  or  per ounce decrease at youngdavidson based on the midpoint of  guidance total capital spending for the companys operating assets is also expected to decrease to between  and  million down  from the midpoint of  guidance

announcement of the merger youngdavidson gold production at youngdavidson is expected to increase approximately  in  to between  and  ounces driven primarily by the ongoing ramp up of underground mining rates underground mining rates are expected to increase from approximately  tpd early in  to a rate of  tpd by the end of the year with a focus on margin expansion and given alamos strong cash position the company has accelerated the transition to  owner underground development this will have an immediate impact reducing per metre development costs as approximately  of the underground development at youngdavidson was being completed by contractor in the fourth quarter of  this will result in higher capital spending in the first half of  as required equipment is purchased but will result in substantially lower capital spending over the next several years positively impacting cash flow underground mined grades are expected to average  gt au in  consistent with  and the mineral reserve grade lower underground grades are expected in the first half of  though these will increase in the second half to average  gt au for the full year mill throughput is expected to average  tpd mill feed from the underground mine will continue to be supplemented by stockpiled open pit ore until underground mining rates ramp up to the mill capacity mill recoveries are expected to average approximately  consistent with  higher mining rates ongoing productivity improvements and a weaker canadian dollar are expected to drive total cash costs lower to  per ounce of gold sold allin sustaining costs are expected to decrease to  per ounce an  or  per ounce decline from the midpoint of  guidance of  per ounce capital spending at youngdavidson is expected to total between  and  million including  to  million of sustaining capital this represents a substantial decrease from  levels despite the fact the company is spending additional capital to accelerate the transition to underground owner development capital spending will be focused on development of the upper and lower mine completion and commissioning of the mcm shaft and raise boring of the lower leg of the northgate shaft in  the company expects youngdavidson to generate sufficient cash flow to fund all sustaining and growth capital expenditures at a gold price of  per ounce with the above noted equipment purchases expected to occur in the first half of  approximately  of the full year budget will be spent over the first six months the company expects a similar rate of capital spending until the ramp up of the underground mining rates to  tpd has been achieved this is expected by mid after which the combination of higher production lower costs and lower capital spending is expected to drive significant free cash flow growth mulatos mulatos is expected to produce  to  ounces of gold in  an increase from  production of  ounces allin sustaining costs are expected to decrease to  per

mined and stacked on the heap leach pad are expected to increase to an average of  gt au up from the  gt au stacked in  the waste to ore ratio is expected to decline to  from a budget of  in  milled grades are expected to average approximately  gt au above the current mineral reserve grade as the company continues to encounter higher grades but fewer tonnes at san carlos total crusher throughput is expected to average  tpd including approximately  tpd from the mill this represents a  increase over total crusher throughput of  tpd in  reflecting both higher throughput rates from the mill and crushing circuit the combined recovery ratio is expected to average  reflecting higher grades stacked late in  and a higher proportion of mixed and sulphide ore stacked open pit heap leach recoveries are expected to increase to approximately  in  and beyond the open pit heap leach operation continues to be the driver and is expected to supply approximately  of production in  the company continues to exploit opportunities for further cost reductions including shortening waste haul routes however the main focus is on expanding and developing the higher grade la yaqui and cerro pelon satellite projects cerro pelon and la yaqui will be substantially lower cost operations and are expected to start contributing production and drive costs lower in  both projects continue to advance with the environmental impact assessment eia for la yaqui expected to be submitted in the first quarter of  the eia submission for cerro pelon is expected to follow in the third quarter these deposits are also among the highest priority exploration targets for alamos with results from the  drill program indicating strong potential to expand their mineral reserve and resource base given their low cost profile any expansion of these projects is expected to have a positive impact on profitability of mulatos capital spending at mulatos is expected to total  million which includes  million of sustaining capital this is down from  reflecting cost control initiatives and lower spending on underground development at san carlos as with youngdavidson the company expects mulatos to generate sufficient cash flow to fund all exploration sustaining and growth capital spending for the full year following the development of cerro pelon and la yaqui in  the company expects a further reduction in costs and a substantial increase in free cash flow from mulatos el chanate el chanate is expected to produce  to  ounces of gold in  down from  ounces in  primarily reflecting lower throughput rates total crushed and run of mine ore is expected to average  tpd down from  tpd in  as part of an optimized mine plan in  that will lower stripping requirements the processed grade run of mine and crushed ore is expected to average  gt au allin sustaining costs are expected to average  per ounce of gold sold total cash costs are expected to be in a similar range and are not comparable to  as the company expects to expense all waste stripping costs in  el chanate is a mature operation with a relatively short remaining mine life the operation was successful in generating positive free cash flow in  and the focus in  and beyond will be on keeping the operation free cash flow positive given the long leach cycle at el chanate more than  recoverable ounces have built up in the leach pad these ounces are expected to be recovered at low costs once mining ceases at the operation providing significant free cash flow at the end of its mine life  global operating and development budget

spending on the companys development projects has been scaled back significantly and will be focused on the highest priority targets this includes completing the permitting process at kirazli and continuing to advance lynn lake towards a feasibility study at current gold prices the company does not anticipate spending significant capital on these projects until the ramp up at youngdavidson and development of the satellite deposits at mulatos has been completed and both operations are generating substantial free cash flow additionally development spending and activities at esperanza and quartz mountain have been significantly reduced agi dagi kirazli and camyurt turkey development budget the  budget for turkey is  million which includes spending associated with completing the

is however in the process of evaluating the impact of updated capital costs forestry fee changes tax incentive availability changes and the devaluation of the turkish lira on the operating costs and overall economics of its projects in the current gold price environment the company expects to defer any major capital spending on kirazli until the above noted ramp up at youngdavidson and development of the mulatos satellite deposits are complete and both operations are generating significant free cash flow to help fund further growth lynn lake development budget the capital budget for lynn lake in  is  million largely comprised of baseline work required for permitting and completing a feasibility level study with the completion of the acquisition of carlisle goldfields earlier this month the company has consolidated  interest in the project the focus over the next  months will be on completing a project description and feasibility study in preparation for permitting costs associated with the lynn lake project are expected to be capitalized in   exploration budget the  exploration budget is  million of which approximately  will be capitalized the majority of the  exploration budget will be focused on the cerro pelon and la yaqui satellite deposits with details as follows cerro pelon a total of  metres m of drilling was completed at cerro pelon during the fourth quarter and  m for the full year the aim of the  program was to test continuation of mineralization to the north of the current pit the program was successful in delineating a new zone of mineralization approximately  m to the north of the reserve mineralization and outside previously designed pit limits excellent drill results were obtained with several intercepts averaging well above the current mineral reserve grade previously released highlight intercepts include  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m and  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m and  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m pel  gt au over  m pel in addition to drilling significant mapping and sampling has been conducted over a large area around the reserve mineralization combined results from all programs indicate that gold mineralization at cerro pelon is associated with quartzalunite alteration brecciation and structures recent mapping and drilling is helping to further refine the companys understanding of the controls on mineralization at cerro pelon results to date have indicated that favorable geology for hosting mineralization exists to the north beneath a massive silica cap preliminary metallurgical test work indicates mineralization is amenable to heap leaching the focus of the  exploration program is to drill test an additional  m to the north with an expected budget of  million la yaqui a total of  m was drilled at la yaqui during the fourth quarter of  bringing the full year total to  m the  exploration program yielded excellent results with step out drilling identifying a new zone of mineralization  m to the northeast of inpit reserve mineralization and further mineralized intercepts encountered over an additional  m of strike length previously released highlight intercepts include  gt au over  m yaq  gt au over  m yaq  gt au over  m yaq approximately  m along strike from yaq  gt au over  m yaq approximately  m along strike from yaq drilling throughout  has indicated the existence of a large hydrothermal system in the yaqui area with continuous alteration over a large area of approximately  kilometres km by  km and oregrade intercepts at distances of up to a  km from known inpit mineralization preliminary metallurgical test work indicates mineralization is amenable to heap leaching the results of the  program at la yaqui will not be incorporated into the  year end mineral reserve and resource statement planned for the end of march  but will be incorporated into subsequent updates a system of this size will require systematic testing and infill drilling therefore the  program will be conducted in two phases the first will be focused on ongoing exploration along the northwesttrending massive silica ridge this will be followed by systematic delineation and definition drilling over portions of this approximately  m strike length with the aim of increasing mineral

cautionary note to us investors alamos prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in canada which differ from the requirements of us securities laws terms relating to mineral resources in this presentation are defined in accordance with national instrument   standards of disclosure for mineral projects under the guidelines set out in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves the united states securities and exchange commission the sec permits mining companies in their filings with the sec to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce alamos may use certain terms such as measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources inferred mineral resources and probable mineral reserves that the sec does not recognize these terms may be used in this presentation and are included in the public filings of alamos which have been filed with the sec and the securities commissions or similar authorities in canada cautionary nongaap measures and additional gaap measures note that for purposes of this section gaap refers to ifrs the company believes that investors use certain nongaap and additional gaap measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies they are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with gaap nongaap and additional gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce as used in this analysis are nongaap terms typically used by gold mining companies to assess the level of gross margin available to the company by subtracting these costs from the unit price realized during the period these nongaap terms are also used to assess the ability of a mining company to generate cash flow from operations there may be some variation in the method of computation of cash operating costs per ounce as determined by the company compared with other mining companies in this context cash operating costs per ounce reflects the cash operating costs allocated from inprocess and dore inventory associated with ounces of gold sold in the period cash operating costs per ounce may vary from one period to another due to operating efficiencies wastetoore ratios grade of ore processed and gold recovery rates in the period total cash costs per ounce includes cash operating costs per ounce plus applicable royalties cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce are exclusive of exploration costs the company has adopted an allin sustaining cost per ounce nongaap performance measure the company believes the measure more fully defines the total costs associated with producing gold however this performance measure has no standardized meaning accordingly there may be some variation in the method of computation of allin sustaining cost per ounce as determined by the company compared with other mining companies in this context allin sustaining cost per ounce reflects total mining and processing costs corporate and administrative costs exploration costs sustaining capital and other operating costs sustaining capital expenditures are expenditures that do not increase annual gold ounce production at a mine site and excludes all expenditures at the companys development projects as well as certain expenditures at the companys operating sites that are deemed expansionary in nature growth capital expenditures represent the amount of expenditures at development projects and certain expenditures at

securities laws in effect in canada which differ from the requirements of us securities laws terms relating to mineral resources in this website are defined in accordance with national instrument  – standards of disclosure for mineral projects under the guidelines set out in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” permits mining companies in their filings with the sec to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce alamos may use certain terms such as “measured mineral resources” “indicated mineral resources” “inferred mineral resources” and “probable mineral reserves” that the sec does not recognize these terms may be used in this website and are included in the public filings of alamos which have been filed with the sec and the securities commissions or similar authorities in canada cautionary nongaap measures and additional gaap measures note that for purposes of this section gaap refers to ifrs the company believes that investors use certain nongaap and additional gaap measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies they are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with gaap additional gaap measures that are presented on the face of the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income include “mine operating costs” “earnings from mine operations” and “earnings from operations” these measures are intended to provide an indication of the company’s mine and operating performance “cash flow from operating activities before changes in noncash working capital” is a nongaap performance measure that could provide an indication of the company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and is calculated by adding back the change in noncash working capital to “cash provided by used in operating activities” as presented on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows “free cash flow” is a nongaap performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash flows invested in mineral property plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets as presented on the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows and that would provide an indication of the company’s ability to generate cash flows from its mineral projects return on equity is defined as earnings from continuing operations divided by the average total equity for the current and previous year “mining cost per tonne of ore” and “cost per tonne of ore” are nongaap performance measures that could provide an indication of the mining and processing efficiency and effectiveness of the mine these measures are calculated by dividing the relevant mining and processing costs and total costs by the tonnes of ore processed in the period “cost per tonne of ore” is usually affected by operating efficiencies and wastetoore ratios in the period “cash operating costs per ounce” “total cash costs per ounce” and “allin sustaining costs per ounce” as used in this analysis are nongaap terms typically used by gold mining companies to assess the level of gross margin available to the company by subtracting these costs from the unit price realized during the period these nongaap terms are also used to assess the ability of a mining company to generate cash flow from operations there may be some variation in the method of computation of these metrics as determined by the company compared with other mining companies in this context “cash operating costs per ounce” reflects the cash operating costs allocated from inprocess and dore inventory associated with ounces of gold sold in the period “cash operating costs per ounce” may vary from one period to another due to operating efficiencies wastetoore ratios grade of ore processed and gold recovery rates in the period “total cash costs per ounce” includes “cash operating costs per ounce” plus applicable royalties cash operating costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce are exclusive of exploration costs “allin sustaining costs per ounce” include total cash costs exploration corporate and administrative share based compensation and sustaining capital costs nongaap and additional gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies for a reconciliation of nongaap and gaap measures please refer to alamos’ managements’ discussion and analysis as presented on sedar and the company’s website technical information except as otherwise noted herein chris bostwick
