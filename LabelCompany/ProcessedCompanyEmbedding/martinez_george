martinez please enable javascript to view this website george martinez about me graphicweb designer graphicweb designer from southern california los angeles i am currently a student at otis college of art and design studying under a strong collective faculty directed by kali nikitas i am a junior transfer student from santa monica community college where i received my technical knowledge on design programs and website development i hold a great passion for identity and logo design this can be a difficult field for a graphic designer to venture into as it requires a great understanding of an emerging dynamic audience however since i enjoy being able to connect my client’s goals with that of their target audience i see past the obstacle to me accomplishment is gained when i have successfully generated a larger audience a longer engagement or a lasting interaction with any of my works my purpose as a graphic designer is to facilitate communication between businesses and customers producers and viewers i believe there should always be a purpose for any piece of design this is why i continually push myself to produce work that is worthy of being viewed and not merely a decorative piece i mainly focus on commercial work that in some way shape or form is linked back to marketing and advertising though i may not consider myself an advertising student i believe any graphic work is in a way an advertising piece promoting an idea expression or product i would never consider my work to be a candidate for museum exhibits i don’t want to be rich i don’t want to be famous i want to be successful in what i do i want to be able to motivate individuals in finding their better natures i want to create to benefit those around me my ultimate goal as a designer is to design a professional sports team logo and a full identity for a major airline as soon as i do this i can die a happy man sergeant before starting my career as a graphic designer i spent  years in the army i am proud to be a two time iraq war veteran while in the army i acquired many awards and honors my proudest moment was when i attained the rank of sergeant e at the age of  once at this position i had the honor of leading a team of troops into my second iraq deployment a successful mission where we aided in the reconstruction of iraq i received an honorable discharge with a driver and mech
