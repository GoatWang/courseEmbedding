review the financial results and jeff will discuss business highlights and fiscal second quarter guidance before we open up the call to questions now id like to turn the call over to jikun jikun kim thank you erica and good afternoon everyone today i will provide details of our q fy financial performance please note that consistent with prior quarters these results include the effects of classifying what remains of emcores telecom and photovoltaic businesses as discontinued operations consolidated revenue for the quarter totaled  million which is  higher than the prior quarter and above the highend of the revenue guidance of  million to  million cable tv market continues to drive revenue both for our docsis  and rf over glass products we also recognized phenomenal ph growth on our satcom video and fiber optic gyro product lines our emerging chip products held steady in the quarter gaap gross profits in q were  million which is  higher than the prior quarter gross margin in the quarter was  down from  in the prior quarter the primary driver of the reduced gross margin during the quarter was a  accelerated spending related to the beijing manufacturing transition efforts on a nongaap basis which takes into consideration adding back fas r expenses as well as afterretirement obligation accruals our nongaap gross margin came in at  normalizing for the effects of the accelerated beijing facility transition expenses our nongaap gross profit margins would have been closer to  as jeff will discuss further in a few moments it is worth noting that our gross margin may fluctuate from quartertoquarter due to changes in product mix and other nonrecurring factors through our discussion last quarter we remain focused on optimizing profitability at the operating income level versus gross profits total gaap operating expenses for rd and sga were  million approximately  higher than the prior quarter primarily due to higher stockbased compensation expenses annual performance bonus accruals and yearend audit fees all offset by lower rd investments during the quarter on a nongaap basis adjusting for fas r and other nonrecurring items operating expenses would have been flat for further details please see the gaap to nongaap reconciliation table in the press release on a gaap basis operating income for the first quarter was  million an increase of  over the prior quarter on a nongaap basis operating income was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the prior quarter normalizing for the effects of the accelerated beijing facility transition expenses our nongaap operating profit margins would have been closer to  exceeding the operating margin target of  we discussed at the end of last quarter our gaap pretax income from continuing operation was  million in q or  higher than the prior quarter primarily due to higher gross profits offset by higher operating expenses and fx losses our nongaap pretax income after taking into consideration certain adjustments all of which are set forth in the nongaap tables included in todays press release was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in the prior quarter please note that we have included additional information regarding unique transactions litigationrelated expenditures severance stock compensation amortization and other items in todays press release to provide further clarity on our results moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement at the end of q fy the companys cash cash equivalents were approximately  million moving on to the balance sheet  im sorry regarding our working capital metrics dsos were at  days a slight increase from the  days in the prior quarter driven by the timing of the shipments in the quarter net inventory turns including noncurrent inventory was at  times slightly lower than the prior quarter the increase in the inventory was driven by the build up of finished goods and the working process inventory ahead of the chinese new year and factory transition efforts in q fy we invested  million in capital expenditures and recognized approximately  in depreciation and amortization capital expenditures remain elevated due to the beijing facility transition and the investments that we are making in our laser file ph in summary we continue to make solid financial progress during the quarter with strong top line growth as market continues to adopt the docsis  solutions we are also beginning to realize the benefits of operational improvement initiatives we began a year ago taken in combination our operations continues to grow profitability and meet our commitments with that i will turn the call over to jeff jeff rittichier thanks jikun good afternoon everyone as jikun highlighted we continued our momentum into the first fiscal quarter delivering sequential revenue growth of  which was at the highend of our guidance more importantly during the quarter we demonstrated our improved manufacturing efficiency and operating leverage by growing nongaap pretax net income sequentially by approximately  with that said id like to provide you with some additional color on the trends we are seeing in each of our served markets as well as in the operations of the business within the cable tv market in the first quarter we continued to see strong sequential growth with the business up roughly  from the fourth quarter and up  from the prior year the overall strength in infrastructure side of cable television not only demonstrates the msos commitment to deploying docsis  fiber deep networks but also highlights emcores leadership position within the space as we discussed last quarter we believe we are still in the early innings of this network buildout and are poised to benefit from our new products such as our lemlbased solutions which are being integrated across our product lines we remain optimistic about growth opportunities in this business and expect to see strong upgrade spending for major and regional msos as we look to expand our addressable market within the cable tv space with new products such as rf over glass its worth reiterating that our focus is on opportunities which are accretive to overall corporate operating margin in our rfog products sales marketing and engineering expense scaled down in lockstep with product margins we expect to see a bit heavier mix of the low end of our rfog product in q driving revenue and nongaap net income up in dollars but at the expense of the gross margin line moving on to the chip market revenues remain flat in the first quarter which we expected weve begun production shipments of g parts at low volumes and were continuing our product development work to address the wireless and datacenter markets which we plan to enter toward the end of  as weve stated previously emcore is working to become broad supplier of chiplevel products to the entire telecom industry thereby optimizing our production mix between captive and merchant use driving a higher blended margin for both our chip business and for the company overall within the satcom and video markets emcore continues to enjoy strong market share and close relationships with customers in our legacy markets while continuing to make progress on introducing new products for adjacent markets such as lband link used by services such as dish and directv as i highlighted last quarter were currently in the process of outsourcing our satcom products to taa which is essentially made in america an itar compliant manufacturing facility operated by our ems partners this transition was largely complete by the end of the first quarter we expect to see modest growth in the satcom product line in fiscal  within the fiber optic gyro market we continue to make progress in building our presence in the market and winning designs against larger competitors in the defense industry in addition to the orders we publicly announced we continue to see increasing momentum for potential new orders in the current fiscal year in addition to delivering production product for the mtsb program and other key program our primary emphasis this year is to deliver preproduction volume for very important new program that we expect move to revenue needle in fy  we recently created an airspace and defense business unit and have brought a new vp general manager with significant experience in the industry to manage this business we will be retrofitting one of our alhambra campus buildings to house key pieces of capital equipment by about the end of the calendar year these upgrades are necessary to support the growing fog in new business and we  and remain expectations remain that we will exit the year with navigation product running at about  of revenue and higher thereafter shifting gears to the operation side of the business our transition to a hybrid ems manufacturing model is nearly complete at the end of q we have largely completed the shift of that car manufacturing to ems suppliers by the end of q we will have finished the relocation of our assembly operation in langfang china to emcore asia which is our new automated facility inside the beijing the new facility has been audited by all of our major customers at this point and we received nearly all of the customer approval for pcm this means that the transition schedule is quite firm with very few moving parts we expect to see some acceleration of expenses related to timing in certain activities over the next quarter or two that may push margins around a little bit but we have included within the window of guidance our nongaap net income i am sorry nongaap operating margin which are targeted at  as we exit q when completed these actions coupled with the numerous initiative we continue to implement as a result of our six sigma training program we will have significantly transformed the operations of emcore from where things were nearly two years ago from a personnel standpoint our automation activities will have made us  more efficient on a cost to goods per employee basis while our outsourcing initiative continue to transform fixed expense to variable costs as we focus on processes where we can demonstrably add value over competing merchant emf perhaps the most significantly evolve these actions will result in the reduction of our breakeven point by  to  million per quarter again i would like to point out the unique aspect of our manufacturing strategy for mixed signal optics the automation processes and cable tv module assembly that are responsible for the dramatic improvement in our commercial business were designed to duel use in our military program allowing us to drive cost reduction and quality improvement in our us manufacturing operation even though the equipment was originally developed by our team in china you should expect to see more of this automation development from us going forward as we strive to make our us manufacturing operation capable of competing with offshore low costs labor as i mentioned before six sigma is driving a new culture here at emcore in a recent investor meeting where we were discussing the savings we have achieved one of our investors asked me whether all the low hanging fruit is now off the tree i replied that indeed a lot of it has been harvested but the juiciest fruit of all was now within our reach because six sigma has thought the organization how to climb the tree my point was that the problem solving skills in this organization have improved markedly and organization wide making emcore able to tackle even more lucrative albeit challenging problem we have actually moved all of our management training and evaluation processes out of hr into the quality organization and are treating management system and organizational development the same way we treat every other process leading for being audited and improve the same way that we solved manufacturing process problem preparing the organization to manage its growth in a controlled and positive structure turning to our outlook for the business for the second fiscal quarter given the continued strength we are seeing in the cable tv business we expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million with nongaap operating margin approximately  to  its worth noting that q has traditionally been a seasonally soft quarter due to weather limitations our roughly flat guidance is significantly better than planned finally we expect to hit the quarter with production almost  end the quarter with production almost completely shifted over to our new ea facility a key milestone in the evolution of emcore now ill turn over the call to the operator to open up for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from the line of joe maxa of dougherty and company your line is open joe maxa thank you and congrats on a nice quarter and outlook jeff rittichier thank you joe joe maxa i wanted to ask a little more on your outlook on  on the cable tv side of things cable tv is very strong currently expected for q i mean from a lot of necessity ph with comcast and others but what are you seeing as far as perhaps new customers  not customers but msos building this year versus perhaps next year and do you expect to see continued growth sequentially through the year jeff rittichier well getting into the limitations of my crystal ball here its hard to say what sequential really means i mean cable could be a little cyclical at times so with that said we see a strong backdrop of spending strength if you look into the documentation that our friends at charter had to file when they bought bright house and time warner indicate that in  they have to begin to build out additional what is essentially high speed capability in the time warner and bright house networks charter has been real good about upgrading as well so the net of it is if you look at what charter is saying it looks like theres additional strength beyond comcast as you mentioned liberty global is certainly doing its thing as it rolls up smaller regional msos over in europe and they have a very strong technology roadmap so  and not to  last but not least the japanese are beginning in  to do a buildout to bring k transmission in for the  olympics so overall we see strength throughout the industry im sure there will be turbulence from time to time things switch back and forth between infrastructure and cpe but all indications are that the major msos are spending joe maxa thats helpful and i just want to probe a little more into your operating margins i mean you hit your existing fiscal year  number pick out ph one times on a nongaap basis of over  guided down in q i know you have some moving parts can you walk through again the drivers of that difference of maybe that  to  op margin for q jikun kim sure so just the pure nongaap reconciliation in the back i would refer to in  q performance and then obviously the beijing transition cost would add about  in costs which would get you up to the  op margin the transition at beijing is not over its just begun so this is  we anticipate that cost in q to be the highest so thats one factor and then we are going to see a higher mix of the archived products which will definitely impact the operating profit performance a little bit so i think were being probably about right at  to  that seems to be a good range and good number but keep in mind we should come out of that in q relatively stronger joe maxa understood all right thats very helpful thank you jeff rittichier yes joe the other little piece is that essentially all the processes will be running in ea within another three weeks so theres redundancy to get stripped out and everything but this is not something that is way out at the end of our headlights joe maxa just that piece of the business that transition over in china once thats complete how do you  i mean you said  million to  million reduction in breakeven is that primarily driven by that operations jeff rittichier yes theres also  also there will be some changes in the operations here in alhambra that will contribute keep in mind though that what were talking about is a reduction in breakeven point so some of the savings essentially go to variable costs which we have to pay third parties to do it but the good news is that it makes us drought resistant of course if the market ever does slow down joe maxa great thanks operator thank you and our next question is from jaeson schmidt of lake street capital your line is open jaeson schmidt hi guys thanks for taking my questions just a followup on one of the previous questions not looking for specific guidance but historically youve seen sequential growth in both the june and september quarters and after a really strong december and march this fiscal year is there anything that you currently see that would not allow that trend to continue jeff rittichier well hi jaeson its jeff so heres the thing normally we start to see signs of a slowdown in lets call it the winter quarter our q calendar q a couple of months ahead of schedule or a couple of months ahead of when it actually hits and we didnt see as much of it theres been the odd push out here and there which actually ended up pushing the market numbers around just a bit already the point of it is that you dont really see indications about where calendar q and calendar q end up until about the middle of march and thats when it seems like everybody wakes up and starts expediting things so again we see a very strong pattern of spend and theres nothing out there that makes us think that theres an oncoming train headed at us but you never know really on the slightly longer view until you hit midmarch and see what quarters look like jaeson schmidt okay thats helpful and then just shifting to the fiber gyro side thats obviously a big area of focus for you guys going forward can you help us understand how youre breaking into that market what gives you guys confidence that you can see continued traction going forward jeff rittichier sure great question so its funny because the fiber gyros we have been working on some of this technology for a very long time weve now been in production with indiscernible mtsd ph program for two years may be a bit more and we are one of their top supplier as has been acknowledged through their award system we are working on other programs for them and as our success has become clear though the industry were getting pulled in to bid on things that two years ago when i joined people wouldnt have considered us for so its a competitive world out there jaeson which is why you havent seen a ton of press releases but we like where we are now the customer relationships that pull us into these programs which are absolutely critical we feel that we have and that were getting good traction so not a lot of specifics in that but we wouldnt be starting to work on expanding our production capacity if we didnt like what we saw going forward jaeson schmidt okay thanks ill jump back into queue operator thank you operator instructions not showing any further questions at this time im sorry it looks like we have an additional question from joe maxa of dougherty and company your line is open joe maxa id ask for the revenue breakout like youve given each quarter on your segments jikun kim yes sure so on the cable tv side we were at  to  of the revenues on the chip side were at  to  in the satcom video were at  to  and on t indiscernible  to  so the mix really didnt change very much from last quarter joe maxa great okay thats all i had thank you jikun kim sure operator thank you and im not showing any additional questions id now like to turn the call back over to mr jeff rittichier for any further remarks jeff rittichier thank you in closing i would like to thank my team for the very hard work they put in everyday and i believe i speak for everyone when i say how we proud we are of the business we are building and the opportunity

third quarter guidance before we open the call up to questions now i will turn the call over to jikun jikun kim thank you erica today i will provide the details of our q fy financial performance please note that consistent with prior quarters these results include the effects of classifying what remains of emcores telecom and photovoltaic businesses as discontinued operations consolidated revenue for the quarter totaled  million which is  higher than the prior quarter and above the high end of the revenue guidance of  million to  million cabletv market continues to drive revenues for both our docsis  and rf over glass products docsis  product revenues held steady relative to q in what has been historically a seasonally low quarter rf over glass product revenues increased significantly from a small base relative to the prior quarter our merchant ship products also showed the strongest performance over the past  quarters with solid gross margins we also recognized nominal growth for our satcom video product line the fiber optic gyro came in lower than prior quarter driven by the timing of customer orders gaap gross profit in q was  million which is  higher than the prior quarter gross margin in the quarter was  up from  in the prior quarter as we discussed on our last call the combination of higher rf over glass revenue mix and spending related to our beijing facility transition efforts created incremental headwinds during the quarter beijing relocation expenses in the quarter were approximately  similar to the prior quarters spend levels on the nongaap basis which takes into consideration adding back fas r expenses as well as asset retirement obligations our nongaap gross margins came in at  the total gaap operating expenses for rd and sga were  million approximately  million higher than the prior quarter sga increased by  million the increase was driven by a  million in ppne impairments impairment charges related to the beijing facility transition and  million in severance charges related to the same these increases were offset by lower litigation expenses and auditrelated activities rd increased by  million driven by higher fiber optic gyro rd activities higher payroll and related taxes and accruals for further details please see the gaap to nongaap reconciliation tables in the press release on a gaap basis operating income for the second quarter was  million reflecting a decrease of  million over the prior quarter on a nongaap basis operating income was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the prior quarter making further adjustments for beijing facility transition expenses nongaap operating income in the quarter would have been closer to  million or  of revenues very close to the q fy operating profit margin objectives of  that we identified during our prior calls our gaap pretax income from continuing operations was  million in q or flat relative to the prior quarter our nongaap pretax income after taking into consideration certain adjustments all of which are set forth in the non gaap tables included in todays press release was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in the same quarter  in the prior quarter please note that weve included additional information regarding unique transactions litigationrelated expenditures impairments severance stock compensation amortization and other items in todays press release to provide further clarity of our results moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement at the end of q fy the companys cash and cash equivalents were approximately  million an increase of  million over the prior quarter regarding our working capital metrics dsos were at  days showing significant improvement from the prior quarter dsos of  days this performance was driven by an even loaded revenue profile in the quarter as well as solid collection efforts net inventory turns including noncurrent inventory was at x holding steady compared to x in the prior quarter absolute value of net inventory declined  million quarteroverquarter in q fy we invested  million in capital expenditures and recognized approximately  million in depreciation capital expenditures declined from q as we moved towards the completion of our beijing facility transition overall the company generated strong free cash flow of  million in the quarter in summary we continued to make solid operational and financial progress towards our q fy operational and financial objectives with that i will turn the call over to jeff jeffrey rittichier thanks jikun and good morning everyone as jikun highlighted we continued our momentum into the second fiscal quarter delivering sequential revenue growth of  in what is normally our seasonally softest quarter and yearoveryear growth of  coming in above the high end of our guidance more importantly during the quarter we again demonstrated our improving manufacturing efficiency and operating leverage by growing nongaap operating income sequentially by about  coming in at the high end of the  to  guidance despite the unfavorable mix of our far higher expenses caused by the relocation of our chinabased manufacturing operation and heavy rd investment with that said id like to provide you with some additional color on the trends were seeing in each of our served markets as well as the operations of our business within the cable television market in the second quarter we continued to see strong sequential growth as our business grew roughly  from the first quarter and was up    over the prior year as we discussed on our last call larger than planned rfog shipments offset the typical seasonal softness we experience in our cable business in the second quarter additionally in q we saw a heavier onetime mix towards the low end of our rfog product family marking the end of a model changeover going forward rfog shipments will primarily consist of more sophisticated highermargin products which incorporate obi mitigation technologies while qs rfog heavy mix created an incremental headwind to the gross margins we kept our operating expenses for those products below the corporate average allowing them to contribute to operating profit and margin in the quarter looking into q and beyond we continue to see strength in the infrastructure side of cable television with docsis  product growth resuming in the june quarter msos remain committed to deploying fiber networks in our most recent earnings call comcast stated that they expect capital intensity to remain flat yearoveryear however they also stated that in the first calendar  their first calendar quarter was about  million lighter than planned and cpe spending would decrease going forward this implies that the remainder of  infrastructure spend should be stronger than planned a few weeks ago charter announced a  billion infrastructure investment pledge over the next four years after backing out the estimated standard charter and twc annual capex spend the  billion figure implies an increase of almost  billion a year we believe were still in the early innings of the network buildout and are poised to benefit from our new products such as our any lemlbased solutions which are being integrated across our product lines moving on to the chip market revenues grew  sequentially quarteroverquarter and early indications from our customers remain very positive for our g parts while we continue product development work on parts to address data center markets with our ost announcements we marked the availability of  gigahertz g wireless devices and expect to continue the development of those products we also received additional customer orders in the gpon market which we can fill from stock in q and q at a highlevel we expect our penetration into these markets will drive a higher blended margin for both our chip business and for the company overall within the satcom and video market emcore started restructuring its product line over a year ago and is starting to see the benefits from those actions we just completed the discontinuation of our video products which carries excessive engineering costs and cut out over  of the product options for our satcom product line as well with the introduction of new lowcost lband links technologies for g are  g radio over fiber das and are focused upon larger satcom systems we expect profits to grow faster than revenue in these product areas with all that final testing transitioned to our ems partners in the us complete we believe we are in a good position to realize incremental operating leverage in these product lines within the fiber gyro market  lets start with the production side of the gyro business within the last week we received notification that we were awarded raytheons premier supplier excellence award only the highest achieving raytheon suppliers are awarded this distinction im extremely proud of the work that our navigation team has done to earn this award for emcore our strong performance on the mtsb program has opened up larger new programs for emcore which we are actively pursuing through product development in our previous calls i indicated that we have important shipment milestones to meet this summer as of today we do expect to meet those delivery commitments paving the way for production of these new products in fy these new products are developed to industry standard and will be sampled to several other customers during the summer and early fall these are the largest navigation market opportunities that we pursue today and were very excited about our position in this business we previously announced that we are negotiating a multiyear agreement which could eventually encompass our entire navigation product family it goes without saying that this is a lengthy process involving complex government contracting regulation consequently these negotiations have been timeconsuming and will affect shortterm gyro shipments over the next quarter or two the most probable impact is some amount of delay in shipment volume making it unlikely that we will hit the goal of our navigation business being  of revenue in q any movement in shipments should not represent a loss of business only a delay typically that is just the way the defense business works shifting gears to the operations side of the business all of our captive cable television manufacturing has been shifted to emcore asia our new automated facility inside the th ring in beijing with this project complete weve significantly transformed the operations of emcore from where they were nearly two years ago over the next three months or so additional automation equipment will be installed to bring our direct headcount down from about  at peak last december to about  this may cause us to incur some additional transition cost in the quarter potentially at about half the level they were in q even as our chinese facilities are being transformed our us operations shifted postcode simulation test and sort operations as well as chiponblock assembly to ems providers as well when combined with the changes in our satcom manufacturing strategy these actions will result in our breakeven point declining by about  million to  million per quarter we should see some impact from these changes in our numbers this quarter but will fully realize the benefits in q its important to understand that this manufacturing transformation is not really the end point for emcore our cable television transmitter manufacturing strategy is a terrific example of this over the past year two of our six sigma green belt projects have given us the ability to automatically tune catv transmitters with high accuracy and minimal touch time the deep learning project was particularly insightful in raising our understanding of profit dynamics when combined with new automation techniques weve achieved pluspercent reduction in touch time per unit this is now complete we are going to move transmitter tuning to the ems providers to eliminate transportation inventory carrying cost and to further improve cycle time over the next year we expect to devote a majority of our six sigma green and black belt projects to wafer fab operations where we will not only improve our standard process controls but build the process nodes that will launch new generations of chip products for both captive and emerging markets we see the fab as a key area for investments in both in terms of capital and the worldclass technologist we need as we work to improve our ability to both execute and invent in our august call well update you all on the result of our  six sigma project just as we did last year with our  actual result turning now to the outlook for the business in the third fiscal quarter given the continued strength were seeing in the cable tv business we expect to see revenue in the  million to  million range with nongaap operating margins about  to  this guidance eliminates over  million in lowend rfog units that was a onetime event in q margins should also start to improve in q depending on the final mix in the quarter now ill turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from tim savageaux with northland capital your line is open timothy savageaux hi good morning can you hear me jeffrey rittichier yes good morning tim timothy savageaux okay great sorry the weather seems muted or not ph couple of questions first congratulations on a real strong  on march quarter i did not quite catch what the drivers of upside on the chip side were wonder if you might mind running back through that and also i think the commentary was business was as strong as its been in a while i dont know if you care to give any more detailed metrics about how much the merchant chip business represented for your business in fiscal q jeffrey rittichier on the product mix side was g apds that we shipped out in larger numbers jikun you want to cover the second part of the question jikun kim sure so in general i think we talked about the chip business being increasing  quarteroverquarter so thats  in terms of revenue mix for the corporation cable tv was about  to  of the business chips were  to  of the business satcom was  to  percent and fog was about  timothy savageaux that is very helpful and from a margin perspective kind of came in right in line with where we thought despite a heavier rfog mix i gather perhaps you saw some offset from the chips strength in terms of overall margin levels and as you look forward i certainly understand the kind of onetime nature of the rfog and not just comcast based on your comments from arris last night i think its fair to expect the current kind of docsis cable tv infrastructure market to continue to grow for the year but as you look into next quarter you expect continued growth in the chip side as well and what sort of  seems like you have a lot of the margin levers moving in the right direction as you head into q jeffrey rittichier yes i would thats right tim were just trying to be conservative until all the moving parts are settled on the final set of automation installations over at ea but yes were  i think were looking at a stronger quarter in terms of chips cant break it down any further than that for you cable tv i think arris said they came in with a booktobill of something about  or something like that so you know overall the signals look quite good and well be at angus in a couple of weeks over in europe when well have a chance to see what liberty globals up to more specifically but right now cable tv is still looking quite strong timothy savageaux good and maybe  final question on the chip side i dont know if youve made any comments on kind of the datacom data center type opportunity weve had other players in the market there may come in particular kind of very nearly kind of shift the entire strategy of the corporation toward opportunities for  gig lasers in the data center talking about sort of multimillion unit type volume opportunities we know youve been doing some developing work in that direction i dont know if thats translating into any revenue yet but id love to hear an update on whats happening on the data com side of the merchant chip business jeffrey rittichier dont have much more to say i would say if anything our detector projects are ahead of the laser projects were still moving forward with a number of customers and well comment further when we actually have something to announce timothy savageaux okay well congrats once again on a good quarter and ill pass it on jeffrey rittichier thank you tim operator and our next question comes from jaeson schmidt with lake street capital your line is open jaeson schmidt hey guys thanks for taking my question just following up on one of the previous questions jeff wondering if you could talk about how your visibility might have improved over the last  months or kind of where your overall visibility is at this point jeffrey rittichier with respect to cable television or other products jaeson schmidt yes catv jeffrey rittichier okay well its  in cable television typically by the time we announced the previous quarters results and we are providing guidance going forward we really have the bulk of the cable television orders in place and there is really very minimal amounts of movement that are allowed based on the supply agreements we have in place almost nothing in  days and then sort of depends from there out and we try to accommodate customers wherever we can but inside the  days things are pretty firm beyond that we look into the forecasting systems of our customers and weve got techniques for eliminating double counting and things like that so its really the combination of that information and indications about infrastructure spend in the msos that give us the insights beyond  days out okay so not much has really changed as far as the way that we look at the information i think with the most recent announcements from comcast charter you look at what arris is now saying publicly things look pretty good in the second half of the year but cable tv compared to say  again we commented about having a multiyear supply agreement were negotiating  those  visibility situations are very different right jaeson schmidt no that makes sense and is very helpful just a clarification on the beijing facility transition those costs will be concluded by the end of the june quarter is that correct jeffrey rittichier yes so essentially what we did is we moved everything from one facility into the other the majority of it has have the automation installed there are a couple of places where automation is being put in place literally as we speak should be largely complete end of may beginning of june so well see a little bit of transition costs we expect it to be down quite a bit from where weve seen it jaeson schmidt okay and given the strong margin performance you just posted i assume that  pro forma operating margin exiting this year and  exiting  if those targets are still on track jeffrey rittichier yes we feel real good about that period jaeson schmidt okay perfect and then just the last one for me and ill jump back in the queue any change as far as how youre thinking about capex this year jikun kim yes  go ahead jeff jeffrey rittichier go ahead jikun jikun kim yes so i think we discussed  million to  million in capex at the beginning of the year q was high q you can see it came down quite a bit from q i think were still on track and obviously many of our capital investment decisions are predicated on return on investment so if we have opportunities where the payback is  to  months well go ahead and invest jeffrey rittichier the other thing to understand about capex is some of these especially when you start talking about fab equipment youre looking at lead times per equipment that could be nine months or more right so the date that we make commitments versus the dates they come in and get commissioned often times there is a called a phase lag jaeson schmidt okay thank you operator and our next question comes from jo maxa from daughtry  company your line is open joseph maxa thank you i just wanted to touch base on the gyroscope business you did mentioned a delay in some shipments in the second half of the year i wanted to just to walk through that again it sounded like it had a lot to do with the government contracts just maybe give us a little more color on what youre seeing and when you would expect those to start shipping jeffrey rittichier sure id like to  im going to defer to jikun because hes been involved with the contract negotiations and i will say its great to have a former raytheon cfo as your cfo in these sorts of situations so jikun if you wouldnt mind providing in some color on this jikun kim sure so its a multiyear agreement its a fiveyear agreement that were negotiating and given the size of the opportunity and the contract theres extra government compliance regulations required and as an organization this is probably our first foray into a multiyear government contract and so were being very methodical and careful about how we understand the requirements and our ability to perform to the requirements its not necessarily the product qualifications or product quality requirements but its all the terms and conditions that come along with taking a very large government contract and thats just taking a little time joseph maxa in that type of contract how do you see that unfold is it more of a grow through the five years i mean may be the first year is the start but is it more kind of a win here as once you get up to a certain run rate jikun kim no the projections look like its increasing over time but the concern would be the future is more certain in the next six months than five years out right so youve got to kind of discount some of the further out volumes that people project and theres some business backing and involved in making that kind of a judgment call joseph maxa okay thats helpful on the chips business your commentary about initial orders coming from the second half of the gpon market are you  did you indicate that you expect the chip business to grow from q levels in the back half jikun kim sure jeffrey rittichier yes i think we will jikun kim sorry jeff go ahead jeffrey rittichier yes i think it will again the point that we  had been made  we had made in the past about gpon was that we really are only going to supply customers that are lets call it multigenerational with g product and not for  were jumping back into it its just that we have some inventory and so well continue to supply that maybe well make a little bit more for them but its really the g targets that are going to get g attention from us when and if they need it just to make it easier for them to do business with us joseph maxa so in the quarter was it the g product that drove the business or was it more of the g jeffrey rittichier it was a combination of telecom parts the g parts g weve got orders joe that will build in q and q joseph maxa okay i see and then i wanted to ask on the sga line last year you had a big step up and im wondering if you would expect to see something like that this june quarter i think last year you said something about a large trade show jeffrey rittichier jikun jikun kim yes the seasonally high trade show quarter was this past quarter ofc is the big trade show so were past that anga is a relatively smaller trade show so we would anticipate on a nongaap basis sga line to be steady joseph maxa got it okay thank you very much operator operator instructions our next question comes from lee krowl with b riley and company your line is open lee krowl hey guys thanks for taking my questions i think most of them have actually been covered but one question on the defense opportunity in there  is that contract does win just given kind of the duration and magnitude of it is that an incremental step up in capex when that if and when that is announced jikun kim jeff do you want to take that one or jeffrey rittichier yes sure i wasnt sure if you meant backward or not the capex necessary for that particular project is pretty much in place we are going to be putting in addition capex for other gyro products that can certainly be used in this contract but weve been building these particular gyros for that customer for the better part of two years at about these sorts of rate so its not a big jolt to the system over on manufacturing capex lee krowl okay and then just kind of as that flows through is that  is the margin structure of the larger contract like that comparable or do you have to concede to the fact that its just a larger contract win so there is some concessions there jikun kim yes jeffrey rittichier well you know  go ahead jikun jikun kim all right in general when customers provide assured longer and higher volumes theres expectations there are concession on prices right so  but i think we should be able to hold around here jeffrey rittichier yes and the short version is the margin would be above corporate average lee krowl okay i was just  the reason i was thinking it was trying to think if guys got this big project online if that changes the timing of the  kind of the outlook on the overall operating margin targets but i guess jeffrey rittichier no it really  it wont it wont except in a positive way it just might push some revenue around more than we would like but the longterm feature on these products is excellent and so were really excited about where we are here lee krowl okay and then on the gpon market is that a function of kind of renewed capex or is there kind of incremental activity in the gpon market just because inventories have kind of been worked down and now are at more at a normalized level jeffrey rittichier its really more the latter than the former and again were only going to supply major customers that are going to buy nextgeneration product from us were not going to be running around in china selling small amounts of this and that lee krowl got it got it fair enough and then just on the last part on these large capex projects from charter  i guess the question is that if these guys come in to you with a large order and kind of comes back to the margin standpoint are these larger billion dollar run rate kind of capex budgets do they require pricing concessions at all just because of the consolidation of customers jeffrey rittichier well its a very competitive market and youve always got pricing pressure i wouldnt say that the uptick is triggering unusual activity lee krowl got it fair enough alright… jeffrey rittichier i mean its a competitive world as it is over in telecom lee krowl right well youve definitely covered my questions congrats on a great quarter and ill get back in line operator and im showing no further courses at this time id like to turn the call over to jeff the ceo for any closing remarks jeffrey rittichier thank you in closing i just want to thank the team here at emcore for the hard work they put in every day i believe i speak for everyone when i say how proud we are of the business weve built the opportunity that lies ahead and
