s table of contents      actively manage assets and finance them conservatively to generate stable predictable and growing cash flows for shareholders and clients we are able to create value for our shareholders in the following ways        we have the ability to identify and acquire attractive real estate assets across many markets in part due to the significant proprietary deal flow driven from an established global network of industry relationships particularly with financial institutions this can create value by allowing us to maintain and develop a large pipeline of attractive opportunities        our operating expertise allows us to focus on opportunistic investments where we can increase the value of assets and cash flows such as in the case of distressed real estate owners or lenders seeking liquidity undermanaged or underleased assets or other repositioning opportunities        many times these investments are acquired at a discount to replacement cost or recent comparative sales thereby offering opportunities to achieve aboveaverage total returns in many cases we have the opportunity to earn significant additional returns such as through a promoted interest based on the performance of the assets        kw imres plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and realtime data for evaluating investments generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies        we understand that real estate is

consolidated ebitda represents our net income before interest expense our share of interest expense included in income from investments in unconsolidated investments depreciation and amortization our     s table of contents   share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt and income taxes we do not adjust consolidated ebitda for gains or losses on the extinguishment of mortgage debt as we are in the business of purchasing discounted notes secured by real estate and in connection with these note purchases we may resolve these loans through discounted payoffs with the borrowers consolidated ebitda is not a recognized term under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity additionally consolidated ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for managements discretionary use as it does not remove all noncash items such as acquisitionrelated gains or consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments tax payments and debt service requirements our presentation of consolidated ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our management believes consolidated ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of consolidated ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance additionally we believe consolidated ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations  adjusted ebitda represents our consolidated ebitda as defined above adjusted to exclude corporate merger and acquisitionrelated expenses our sharebased compensation expense and ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests our management uses adjusted ebitda to analyze our business because it adjusts consolidated ebitda for items we believe do not accurately reflect the nature of our business going forward or that relate to noncash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance additionally we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations however consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our managements discretionary use as they do not remove all noncash items such as acquisitionrelated gains or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments  prior to  our adjusted ebitda metric was comparable to our current consolidated ebitda metric as it was calculated as consolidated ebitda adjusted to solely exclude mergerrelated expenses and sharebased compensation expense beginning in  as noncontrolling interests became more significant on our consolidated balance sheet primarily due to the consolidation of kwes results on our financial statements we determined that it was appropriate to supplement consolidated ebitda with a new or revised metric  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings by fixed charges for this purpose earnings consists of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and our equity in income of joint ventures plus fixed charges and operating distributions from equity investees and fixed charges consists of interest expense whether capitalized or expensed amortization related to indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense     s table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income loss the most directly comparable gaap

to changes in our business        we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage        it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy        the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness including the notes        a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes and        our business and financial condition would materially and adversely suffer if we were unable to service our indebtedness including the notes or obtain additional financing as needed in addition the indenture governing the notes and the initial notes the indenture governing the  notes and our unsecured revolving credit facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may

to offer to repurchase all of the notes the initial notes and the  notes we may have insufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the notes the initial notes or the  notes upon a fundamental change in addition our unsecured revolving credit facility provides that the occurrence of a change of control constitutes a default our failure to purchase tendered notes initial notes and  notes would constitute a default under the relevant indenture governing the same which in turn would constitute a default under our credit facility see description of the notesfundamental change in the event of a change of control or termination of trading of our common stock our series b preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of the stockholders thereof under the indentures governing the notes the initial notes and the  notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in those indentures which includes a change of control event or a delisting of our common stock each noteholder will have the right to require us to purchase that noteholders notes initial notes or  notes at a purchase price equal to  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the repurchase date the occurrence of a fundamental change will also trigger a redemption right held by the holders of our series b preferred stock under the certificate of designation establishing the terms of such preferred stock under the terms of these indentures kennedywilson may not make any restricted payment to facilitate a redemption of the series b preferred stock unless kennedywilson has restricted payment capacity or has previously made an offer to noteholders to purchase their notes if the noteholders however fail for any reason to tender all of their notes under the offer to purchase them and our preferred stockholders accept the offer to purchase the series b preferred stock we will be required to use cash to fund the purchase of our series b preferred stock in the event this occurs it may be more difficult for us to make scheduled payments on the untendered notes see description of the notesfundamental change in addition we may not redeem the series b preferred stock without the consent of the lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facility our failure to purchase the series b preferred stock when required could give the holders of that stock a legal claim against us a subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under us bankruptcy or similar state law which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims under us bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws a subsidiary guarantee can be voided or claims under the subsidiary guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that subsidiary guarantor if among other things the subsidiary guarantor at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its subsidiary guarantee or in some states when payments become due under the subsidiary guarantee received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the subsidiary guarantee and        was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence        was engaged in a business or transaction for which the subsidiary guarantors remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or        intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature a subsidiary guarantee may also be voided without regard to the above factors if a court finds that the subsidiary guarantor entered into the subsidiary guarantee with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors   s table of contents a court would likely find that a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its subsidiary guarantee if the subsidiary guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes if a court were to void a subsidiary guarantee you would no longer have a claim against the subsidiary guarantor sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining guarantors if any in addition the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor the measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending on the governing law generally a subsidiary guarantor would be considered insolvent if        the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets        the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they became absolute and mature or        it could not pay its debts as they became due each subsidiary guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the subsidiary guarantors liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of its obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law the notes will not be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries the notes will not be guaranteed by a number of our subsidiaries to the extent that any of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the notes the notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations including indebtedness of those nonguarantor subsidiaries the claims of creditors of the nonguarantor subsidiaries including trade creditors will have priority as to the assets of those subsidiaries as a result if we default on our obligations under the notes you will not have any claims against any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes for the six months ended june   and the year ended december   the revenues of our nonguarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately  and  respectively of kennedywilson holdings consolidated revenues and the operating income of our nonguarantor subsidiaries for those periods was approximately  million and  million respectively as of june   the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately  of kennedywilson holdings consolidated total assets and those subsidiaries had  million of secured nonrecourse mortgage indebtedness excluding debt premium and discount of which none has recourse to us however these figures are as of june   and do not reflect transactions that we have entered into after that date or future transactions that we may enter into depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into those subsidiaries may not be required by the terms of the indenture governing the notes to guarantee the notes accordingly these figures may fluctuate from time to time and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future periods for example the instruments governing our acquisitions such as the relevant loan agreement or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower or any related joint venture agreement or the terms of any relevant coinvestment vehicle or separate account or investment program may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the notes in many such cases the indenture does not require our subsidiaries including those described above to guarantee the notes in addition the indenture does not require subject to limitation certain nonmaterial and nonwholly owned subsidiaries to guarantee the notes   s table of contents we may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries and our joint ventures that may be needed to make payment on the notes although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures our subsidiaries and joint ventures are not obligated to make funds available to us for payment on the notes accordingly our ability to make payments on the notes depends on the earnings of and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries and joint ventures furthermore our subsidiaries will be permitted under the terms of the indentures governing the notes the initial notes and the  notes our unsecured revolving credit facility and the instruments governing other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions the payment of dividends or the making of loans by those subsidiaries to us the agreements governing the future indebtedness of our subsidiaries may not permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on the notes when due see description of other indebtedness to service our indebtedness including the notes we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the notes and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control however our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations current capital spending projects may require significant additional funds to complete or be successful and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness including the notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we consummate an acquisition our debt service requirements could increase we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness including the notes on or before maturity we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our unsecured revolving credit facility the notes the initial notes and the  notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all an active trading market for the notes may not develop prior to this offering there was no public market for the notes we have been informed by certain of the underwriters that they intend to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed however the underwriters may cease their marketmaking activities at any time in addition the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for high yield securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the financial performance or prospects of companies in our industry generally as a result an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the notes if an active market does not develop or is not maintained the market price of the notes may decline and the liquidity of the notes may be limited our debt agreements will contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business the indenture governing the notes and the initial notes the indenture governing the  notes and the agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit kennedywilsons and its restricted subsidiaries ability to among other things        incur or guarantee additional indebtedness        pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock        make investments   s table of contents      create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us        sell the stock of our subsidiaries        transfer or sell assets        create liens        enter into saleleaseback transactions        enter into transactions with affiliates and        enter into mergers or consolidations additionally the agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes and the initial notes the indenture governing the  notes and the agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility we may also be unable to take advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness see description of other indebtedness many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade by moodys and sp and no event of default has occurred and is continuing many of the covenants in the indenture governing the notes will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade as defined in the indenture by moodys and sp provided that at such time no event of default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade or if they are rated investment grade that the notes will maintain such ratings termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force see description of the notescertain covenants   s table of contents special note regarding forwardlooking

transferred in whole and not in part only to another nominee of dtc or to a successor of dtc or its nominee beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form

beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of dtc and its direct or indirect participants which may change from time to time depository procedures the following description of the operations and procedures of dtc are provided solely as a matter of convenience these operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them we take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters dtc has advised us that dtc is a limitedpurpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations collectively the participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of its participants the participants include securities brokers and dealers including the underwriters of the notes   s table of contents

held by or on behalf of dtc only through the participants or the indirect participants the ownership interests in and transfers of ownership interests in each security held by or on behalf of dtc are

and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through records maintained by dtc with respect to the participants or by the participants and the indirect participants with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global notes investors in the global notes who are participants in dtcs system may hold their interests therein directly through dtc investors in the global notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system all interests in a global note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of dtc the laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own consequently the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global note to such persons will be limited to that extent because dtc can act only on behalf of participants which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a global note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the dtc system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests except as described below owners of an interest in the global notes will not have notes registered in their names will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the indenture for any purpose payments in respect of the principal of and interest if any on a global note registered in the name of dtc or its nominee will be payable to dtc in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture under the terms of the indenture

purposes consequently none of the issuer the trustee nor any agent of the issuer or the trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for  any aspect of dtcs records or any participants or indirect participants records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the global notes or for maintaining supervising or reviewing any of dtcs records or any participants or indirect participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or  any other matter relating to the actions and practices of dtc or any of its participants or indirect participants dtc has advised us that its current practice upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes including principal and interest is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless dtc has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of dtc payments by the participants and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary   s table of contents practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of dtc the trustee or the issuer neither the issuer nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by dtc or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes and the issuer and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from dtc or its nominee for all purposes transfers between participants in dtc will be effected in accordance with dtcs procedures and will be settled in sameday funds dtc has advised the issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account dtc has credited the interests in the global notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction however if there is an event of default under the notes dtc reserves the right to exchange the global notes for legended notes in certificated form and to distribute such notes to its participants although dtc has agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in dtc dtc is under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures and may discontinue such procedures at any time none of the issuer the guarantors the trustee or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by dtc or its direct or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations exchange of global notes for certificated notes a global note is exchangeable for certificated notes if  dtc a notifies the issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes and dtc fails to appoint a successor depositary or b has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act  the issuer at its option notifies the trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the certificated notes or  there has occurred and is continuing a default with respect to the notes and the trustee has received a request from dtc to issue certificated notes in addition beneficial interests in a global note may be exchanged for certificated notes under prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of dtc in accordance with the indenture in all cases certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interests in global notes will be registered in the names and issued in any approved denominations requested by or on behalf of the depositary in accordance with its customary procedures same day settlement and payment the issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the global notes including principal and interest if any by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the global note holder the issuer will make all payments of principal and interest if any with respect to certificated notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the certificated notes or if no such account is specified by mailing a check to each such holders registered address the notes represented by the global notes are expected to trade in dtcs sameday funds settlement system and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will therefore be required by dtc to be settled in immediately available funds the issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in immediately available funds   s table of contents material us federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a summary of the material us federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes issued pursuant to this offering but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects the effects of other us federal tax laws such as estate and gift tax laws and any applicable state local or nonus tax laws are not discussed this discussion is based on the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code treasury regulations promulgated thereunder judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the us internal revenue service the irs in each case in effect as of the date hereof these authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect an owner of the notes we have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the irs regarding the matters discussed below there can be no assurance the irs or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes this discussion is limited to beneficial owners who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of section  of the code generally property held for investment in addition this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the notes for cash pursuant to this offering at the public offering price indicated on the cover page of this prospectus supplement this discussion does not address all us federal income tax consequences relevant to an owners particular circumstances including the impact of the medicare contribution tax on net investment income in addition it does not address consequences relevant to persons subject to special rules including without limitation        us expatriates and former citizens or longterm residents of the united states        persons subject to the alternative minimum tax        us holders as defined below whose functional currency is not the us dollar        persons holding the notes as part of a hedge straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment        banks insurance companies and other financial institutions        real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies        brokers dealers or traders in securities        controlled foreign corporations passive foreign investment companies and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid us federal income tax        s corporations partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes and investors therein        taxexempt organizations or governmental organizations and        persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the code if an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds the notes the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level accordingly partnerships holding the notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the us federal income tax consequences to them   s table of contents this discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the us federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the notes arising under other us federal tax laws including estate and gift tax laws under the laws of any state local or nonus taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty qualified reopening for us federal income tax purposes we expect and the following discussion assumes that the notes will be treated as issued in a qualified reopening of the initial notes for us federal income tax purposes debt instruments issued in a qualified reopening are deemed to be part of the same issue as the original debt instruments under the treatment described in this paragraph the notes will have the same issue date and the same issue price as the initial notes for us federal income tax purposes tax considerations applicable to us holders definition of a us holder for purposes of this discussion a us holder is a beneficial owner of a note that for us federal income tax purposes is or is treated as        an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states        a corporation created or organized under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia        an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax regardless of its source or        a trust that  is subject to the primary supervision of a us court and the control of one or more united states persons within the meaning of section a of the code or  has a valid election in effect to be treated as a united states person for us federal income tax purposes preacquisition accrued interest a portion of the price paid for a note will be allocable to interest that accrued prior to the date the note is purchased preacquisition accrued interest we intend to take the position that to the extent a portion of a us holders purchase price is allocable to preacquisition accrued interest a portion of the first stated interest payment equal to the amount of such preacquisition accrued interest will be treated as a nontaxable return of such preacquisition accrued interest to the us holder amounts treated as a return of preacquisition accrued interest should not be taxable when received but should reduce a us holders adjusted tax basis in the note by a corresponding amount payments of stated interest payments of stated interest on a note other than preacquisition accrued interest generally will be taxable to a us holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued in accordance with such us holders method of tax accounting for us federal income tax purposes certain additional payments in certain circumstances see description of the notesoptional redemption and description of the notesfundamental change we may be obligated to make payments in excess of stated interest and the   s table of contents principal amount of the notes we intend to take the position that the notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of these additional payments this position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood as of the date of issuance of the notes that such additional payments will have to be made assuming this position is respected any amounts paid to a us holder pursuant to any such redemption or repurchase as applicable would be taxable as described below in tax considerations applicable to us holderssale or other taxable disposition our position is binding on a us holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable treasury regulations the irs however may take a position contrary to our position which could affect the timing and character of a us holders income with respect to the notes us holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes and the consequences thereof the remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments premium if a us holder purchases a note for an amount excluding any portion thereof allocable to preacquisition accrued interest that exceeds the notes principal amount the us holder will be considered to have purchased the note with amortizable bond premium in an amount equal to the excess generally a us holder may elect to amortize the premium as an offset to interest using a constantyield method over the remaining term of the notes however because the notes may be optionally redeemed by us for an amount in excess of their principal amount special rules apply that could result in a deferral of the amortization of the bond premium until later in the term of the notes under the treasury regulations a us holder may offset the stated interest income allocable to an accrual period with the bond premium allocable to the accrual period if the bond premium allocable to an accrual period exceeds the stated interest income allocable to the accrual period the excess is treated as a bond premium deduction however the amount treated as a bond premium deduction is limited to the amount by which such us holders total interest inclusions on the notes in prior accrual periods exceed the total amount treated by such holder as a bond premium deduction in prior accrual periods if any of the excess bond premium is not deductible that amount is carried forward to the next accrual period if a us holder elects to amortize bond premium the us holder must reduce its adjusted tax basis in the notes by the amount of the bond premium used to offset interest income as set forth above an election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations held or subsequently acquired by the us holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and may be revoked only with the consent of the irs sale or other taxable disposition a us holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of a note the amount of such gain or loss will generally equal the difference between the amount received for the note in cash or other property valued at fair market value less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid stated interest which will be treated as a payment of interest and the us holders adjusted tax basis in the note a us holders adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be equal to the amount the us holder paid for the note reduced by amortized bond premium and by any preacquisition accrued interest previously received any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder has held the note for more than one year at the time of sale or other taxable disposition otherwise such gain or loss will be shortterm capital gain or loss longterm capital gains recognized by certain noncorporate us holders including individuals generally are eligible for taxation at reduced rates the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations information reporting and backup withholding a us holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives payments on a note or proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of a note including a   s table of contents redemption or retirement of a note certain us holders are exempt from backup withholding including corporations and certain taxexempt organizations a us holder will be subject to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt and such holder        fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number        furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number        is notified by the irs that it previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or        fails to certify under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the irs has not notified it that it is subject to backup withholding backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a us holders us federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the irs us holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption tax considerations applicable to nonus holders definition of a nonus holder for purposes of this discussion a nonus holder is a beneficial owner of a note that is neither a us holder nor an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes payments of interest interest paid on a note to a nonus holder that is not effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states generally will not be subject to us federal income tax or withholding tax of  or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty provided that        the nonus holder does not actually or constructively own  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock        the nonus holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us through actual or constructive stock ownership and        either  the nonus holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it is not a united states person and provides its name and address  a securities

the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it or the financial institution between it and the nonus holder has received from the nonus holder a statement under penalties of perjury that such holder is not a united states person and provides a copy of such statement to the applicable withholding agent or  the nonus holder holds its note directly through a qualified intermediary within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations and certain conditions are satisfied   s table of contents if a nonus holder does not satisfy the requirements above such nonus holder may be entitled to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable tax treaty to claim such entitlement the nonus holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed irs form wben or wbene or other applicable documentation claiming a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the united states and the country in which the nonus holder resides or is established if interest paid to a nonus holder is effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states and if required by an applicable income tax treaty the nonus holder maintains a permanent establishment in the united states to which such interest is attributable the nonus holder will be exempt from the us federal withholding tax described above to claim the exemption the nonus holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid irs form weci certifying that interest paid on a note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct by the nonus holder of a trade or business within the united states any such effectively connected interest generally will be subject to us federal income tax at the regular graduated rates a nonus holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of  or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty on such effectively connected interest as adjusted for certain items the certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically nonus holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the irs nonus holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty sale or other taxable disposition a nonus holder generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of a note such amount excludes any amount allocable to

of the outstanding notes or certain of our or their affiliates are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under section  of erisa andor section  of the code or comparable provisions of similar laws unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory class or individual prohibited transaction exemption in this regard the us department of labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions ptces that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and or holding of the notes these class exemptions include without limitation ptce  for transactions determined by independent qualified

conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied because of the foregoing the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under section  of erisa or section  of the code and will not constitute a similar violation of any applicable similar laws representation

result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under section  of erisa or section  of the code or a similar violation under any applicable similar laws the foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in nonexempt prohibited transactions it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering whether to purchase the notes or hold or dispose of the notes on behalf of or with the assets of any plan consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of erisa section  of the code and any similar laws to such transaction and whether an exemption would be applicable to such transaction investors in the notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase of the notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of erisa or the code or any similar provisions of similar laws the sale of
