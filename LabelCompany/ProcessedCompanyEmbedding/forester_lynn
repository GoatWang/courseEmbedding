forestry assistance for nonindustrial private landowners misaf spring meeting sister societies michigan  mississippi obituary lynn sandberg rueben griewe year saf member researchers analyze public response to national forest issues saf council report february  msaf state business meeting notes february  habitat for humanity project one of the greatest opportunities and challenges in professional forestry lies in communicating positively with the public we have much that is positive to communicate we are proud of michigans vast healthy foreststhe largest dedicated state forest system in the country three national forests and over  million acres in private and corporate forests we are proud as well of our role as forest stewards helping to manage this resource for a myriad of uses and resource outputs the michigan society of american foresters misaf in preparing to host the  national saf convention has formed a partnership with the traverse city habitat for humanity program to build a home we feel this offers foresters and forest industry alike a tremendous opportunity to showcase our forest resources with a very direct and specific outcomea home for a family under the guidance of certified builders we will physically build the home at the convention site during the convention hundreds of saf volunteers will be involved in this weeklong house raising effort our outreach project does not stop there we will use video photo and live interviews to graphically illustrate the connection between the wood products in the home and the resource where they are managed building materials will be linked to the private industrial state and federal lands where they originated each site will be used to illustrate stewardship and land management for resource outputs a documentary is planned in partnership with a local television station the story of our home will be used to feature how michigan forestry provides a healthy and productive forest resource the focus will be on the people who plant the trees manage or own the land harvest a renewable resource produce forest products and finally utilize the forest products most importantly this home building effort will demonstrate how families rely on the many wood products used in everyday living the documentary will also focus on the environmental advantages of wood over other products its low energy cost to produce its renewability and its abundance lastly it will highlight the most recent michigan resource facts such as michigans timber volume has increased more than a third since  we want this to be a media event we hope to draw national attention as well as day to day local media coverage the public will watch as the drama unfolds from a managed forest to a pile of wood at the start of the convention to a home for a family at convention close it will be a vivid representation tying the natural resource to the homes people build this is your invitation to participate the success of this outreach depends on support from misaf members and the forestry community we have an excellent opportunity to accomplish something that we have been talking about doing for quite some time  communicate to the public about forestry and about saf a core group of about a dozen misaf members led by bill sterrett  sterretwstatemius is seeking financial and material support working with the national saf contracting professional video services and seeking a significant national spokesperson to champion our efforts we expect involvement from many as this project evolves convention attendees will have the opportunity to pound a few nails too were excited about the project and its tremendously positive attributes this will be the largest gathering of professional foresters in the world for  please join us if you or your organization would like to be a partner in the misaf habitat for humanity project by contributing a portion of the project materials or by making a

antrim  kalkaska cds lora freer alcona iosco ogemaw  oscoda cds rick lucas osceolalake  mecosta cds randy aldrich bay  midland cds rory mattson delta  menominee cds editors note this is a position paper submitted by the cdfc which represents conservation district foresters across the state the significance of nonindustrial private forestlands here in michigan is well documented it has been reported that forestland acreages have increased  percent since  it is also significant that individual ownership of private forestland is increasing that is there are more people who own forested acres than ever before of the  million acres of forestland in the state nonindustrial private forest nipf landowners hold approximately  percent of this land in addition michigans forest economy continues to grow increasing the demand for wood products from nipf landowners private land management objectives are diverse and constantly changing more often than not private ownership goals revolve around other forest benefits such as wildlife aesthetics and recreational uses producing forest products is rarely the reason for ownership of nipf lands landowners often have difficulty balancing multipleuse issues on their acreages and often succumb to poor management advice the lack of sound advice causes many landowners to withdraw their acreages from any management recommendations or activities the delivery of sound unbiased technical assistance is the cornerstone of the educational process assisting landowners in resource planning as well as the implementation of planned practices is a huge responsibility mistakes in land management activities are often long term and have far reaching consequences the offering of unbiased technical assistance in forestry has been well received throughout the state requests for assistance cover the full gamut of forestryrelated subjects areas of assistance considered extremely significant or important are as follows ontheground technical assistance to landowners long range resource planning proper harvesting and marketing referral advice information and educational programs wildlife habitat reforestation watershed protection incentives programs applications and implementation insect and disease problems rural development resource protection the conservation district foresters play a key role in providing unbiased services to nipf landowners and the protection of michigans natural resources cd foresters have a unique perspective regarding private forestland activities and have the ability to strengthen and cultivate common interests regarding forestry issues statewide footnotes to forestry assistance article  the conservation district forestry committee is a five member group elected by the  conservation district foresters employed throughout the state in short it is a peer group selected to represent the forestry assistance program and address statewide natural resource issues such as private forestland activities and assistance conservation district forestry programs state and federal forestry incentives programs funding continuing education personnel and policy issues  usda forest service figures   misaf spring meeting by deb begalle and ken salo a joint meeting hosted by michigan saf and the michigan chapter of the wildlife society was held february  at escanaba michigan this was an appropriate site for the field workshop entitled lowland conifers cooperative management of a complex resource since  of michigans lowland conifers occur in the upper peninsula with delta county having the second highest lowland acreage additionally delta county is a major deer wintering area about  attendees rotated by busloads through established demonstration stops for onsite discussions of the problems and opportunities presented by this particular mix of forestry and wildlife management thursday morning speakers provided background for afternoon and friday field trips gem castillo michigan state university msu displayed the composition and distribution of three lowland conifer stands tamarack cedar and black spruce with associated species components he presented average stumpage prices for these species from the s to mids there is a trend of increased prices  especially in the sawlog category a visit to the rapid river rustic log home manufacturer late in the day demonstrated there is a demand for cedar posts and logs which are in short supply thus increasing the stumpage price of cedar kurt pregitzer michigan technological university mtu summarized the history and ecology of cedar compared to preeuropean times the occurrence of fir and cedar has increased whereas tamarack has declined dramatically and spruce slightly todays cedar forests are the result of logging and related disturbance in the late s some stands reestablished full stocking within  years of harvest while other stands continued to gain stocking through the s kurt stressed that in cedar there may be no relationship between size and age this was later demonstrated in the field where two trees of vastly different diameters that were cut were shown to be of the same age jim hammill michigan department of natural resources mdnr rounded out the morning with remarks on use of lowland conifers by wildlife and the transition zones between lowlands and uplands in the field kevin doran us forest service pointed out how the closed canopy in these stands reduces snow depth and produces a microclimate conducive to wintering deer other field stops the first day included demonstrations of solar electric and conventional fencing to exclude deer and protect cedar regeneration lime and fertilizer application site preparation with heavy machinery and cut and leave strips overall the day showed the importance and difficulty of managing lowland conifers and the extreme difficulty of obtaining successful cedar regeneration in areas of high deer population it is clear that lowland conifer management has to be a joint effort between wildlife and forestry professionals two thoughts seemed to recur throughout day if you believe high deer populations are inhibiting establishment of forest regeneration you need to express that opinion at public meetings and elsewhere when mdnr biologists must face hunters who want higher populations of deer foresters must make clear to the public the short and longterm impacts of high deer populations on the forests not only in winter deer yards but in other forest types as well a second thought was that winter feeding of the deer only compounds the problems of high deer numbers and should be discouraged friday field trips discussed actual management applications on public and private lands at a small clearcut within the north perkins deer yard on the escanaba river state forest speakers craig albright biologistmdnr dean wilson forestermdnr and mike zuidema retired silviculturistmdnr discussed problems and rationale for the area state policy is to cut about  acres per year in the cedar type for research in view of the long establishment period for cedar its slow growth longevity and risk of converting to other species this is felt to be a very conservative approach which does not jeopardize existing cedar stands a major drawback to thinning cedar stands by removing shortlived species is the opening of these otherwise impenetrable stands to atv traffic and a host of negative issues associated with this access economic implications of the state and federal cutnocedar policy are a decrease of supply increase of prices and the shift of the market and decisionmaking to private landowners a site visit to a privately owned area for the day was a  acre swamp conifer tract owned by don bovin primarily managed as recreational lands mr bovin is working with mead corporation forester vic lyberg a  acre harvest is planned which includes clearcutting areas of balmofgilead and thinning cedar by cutting trees containing at least two merchantable pieces the objective of the harvest is to recapture some of the investment in purchase cost of the land and taxes while leaving most of the acreage alone the expected per acre return is fairly high and demonstrates why private landowners may be more willing to permit harvest on their properties attendees to this excellent field workshop left with a bibliography and technical binder compiled by ray miller brad bender and bill cook  cfe credits to claim and hopefully a greater appreciation of the complexities both for biologists and foresters of managing lowland conifer stands in deer country for a pictorial tour of this conference click here editorial note an excellent rundown of this and other misaf activities is available on the internet at httpforestrymsuedumsaf the editorial board needs your feedback is this an expansion of newsletter audience or a duplication should newsletter articles be shorter the same

entertainment committee invites you to bring your family and enjoy the fun   come home to michigan by mike moore what a great convention your professional peers have planned for september it is my estimation that the state of michigan institutions of higher learning have produced more foresters than any other state michigan state university university of michigan and michigan technological university have all graduated foresters for many years with the two downstate universities dating back to the turn of the century therefore we have embarked on a campaign  come home to michigan  to bring back the graduates we have sent individual letters to each of the three department heads asking them to emphasize the convention in their mailings to alumni we need your help also how about inviting your summer camp roommates back do you have friends that you would like to reconnect with what an opportunity college days always bring back a stream of memories make that call to your fellow crew member in dendrology soils or management class we plan to have the alumni socials for the three schools in adjoining rooms on sunday evening maybe we can replay the paul bunyan liars contest or other conclave activities   visit with your friends by joyce angelling plan to make the most of your trip to traverse city plan a few days in advance to allow yourself some time to make stops along the way to visit folks you havent seen in a while or make the most of the fall colors on your return trip home and meander along the back roads to your friends place so you can catch up on old times maybe you and your friends can take the time to throw a line in the stream to catch a fish or two or get some bird hunting in you can also take the opportunity to do some camping as you travel to and from traverse city as well as camping on the bay at traverse city state park while attending the convention take the time to look through the convention brochure and perhaps one of the tours would be a relaxing way to catch up with a buddy while enjoying the local sights another option would be to invite your friends to the convention itself lets demonstrate how the forestry profession is managing their resources as you look through the convention brochure its plain to see how our rich state and its surrounding neighbors are being showcased to the nation along with the most current issues facing resource managers the discussions promise to be very challenging for any stakeholder so maybe there is someone you know who would want to attend this convention for even a day or two just pass along the brochure the possibilities of great times with great friends are endless so just get your michigan map out and start making plans   thanks to sponsors saf would like to thank the

useful to your career and business while the exhibit area will provide you with a wonderful source of new tools and information associated with the forestry profession it will also help the misaf present you with a financially sound and exiciting convention   sister societies misaf teams up by mike lanasa something new in  is the establishment of a sister society relationship between michigan saf and mississippi saf you have probably heard of sister cities before generally a city in the united states will pair up with a city in another part of the word to gain understanding and promote friendship between the two cities hopefully we can achieve similar results between saf members in michigan and mississippi it promises to be an interesting approach to learning about forestry in another part of the country the two states are similar in that both have about  saf members and somewhere between  million acres of forest on the other hand michigan has about  public ownership of forests while  of mississippi forest is in private ownership and while both states have a similar volume of growing stock mississippis growth is  higher and removals are double those in michigan how do these differences affect the way foresters view resource management the sister society concept originated at the saf national leadership academy in  bob daniels mississippi chair and mike lanasa michigan chair wanted to initiate a way to help foresters from their respective states get to know one another and to learn how forestry in each state is practiced a followup meeting between officers of the two societies at the memphis convention quickly indicated the possibilities for increased understanding of forestry issues and approaches to dealing with them a lively discussion of bmps forester registration and prescribed burning laws showed different ways of approaching common situations it was very evident to those present that the sister society concept has much to offer members in both states in  we will begin to explore this relationship and see where it goes we have begun by exchanging newsletters between officers in each of the states the michigan forester is being sent to mississippi and we in michigan are receiving the magnolia forester we will also be initiating a section in the michigan forester with information provided from mississippi saf and vice versa the idea being to start communication between foresters in the two states it has also been suggested that we plan a social event at the national convention for members from the two states other activities may occur in the future as this concept develops the sister society relationship between michigan and mississippi saf is a first for the society of american foresters it has great promise to foster and promote friendships and professional exchange if you have ideas on activities we should try or methods to improve the concept please let your executive team know   mississippi forest industry maturing reprinted from the clarionledger october   mississippis forest products have set record production values in nine of the past  years but the best word to describe the industry is maturing mississippis forest industry is beginning to mature and has established a firm hold on the national market said bob daniels extension forestry specialist at mississippi state university the south has net an incresed share of the nations softwood lumber needs in the past five years and this has benefitted mississippis economy today our industry is more of a critical piece of the national puzzle than ever daniels said it is even more important now for landowners to keep land in forests make good management decisions and boost timber production about  percent of mississippis forest production value is from pine including pulp and paper poles lumber and strucural panel products like plywood daniels said the delivered value of pine sawlogs was almost half a billion dollars in  pine sawlogs were  percent of the toal havest value trends toward more outdoor activities and the use of treated wood in construciton have contributed to the value of pine daniels said the bulk of the hardwood industry is lumber production primarily red and white oak lumber the  value of hardwood sawlogs was   million the value of hardwood pulpwood pulp and paper for  was   million this wood goes into chips for pulp and paper or structural panels like oriented strandboard daniels said mississippi exports about  percent of the hardwood chips obituary lynn sandberg lynn sandberg a year member of saf died on november   in lanse michigan after a short illness lynn earned his bs in forestry from the university of minnesota in  and became an saf member in the same year prior to earning his degree lynn

development task force   rueben griewe year saf member by doug dekoster hometown bemidji mn currently lives in escanaba education graduated from msu in  with a bachelor of science in forestry in a large class of  with tuition of  per quarter joined saf briefly while a student but lapsed while in the service family married to marge for  years as of next september three children including barb trained as a forester and engineer and currently a mead mill manager career served with army rotc in south dakota ccc camp officer in illinois active duty in the army and air force for about five years in various locations also worked for a lumber company in detroit when a lot of building was going on moved at least  times within the first six years in november  rueben started with kimberlyclark in the duluth area and worked most of the time out of marquette and iron mountain until may  when he retired just shy of  years he recalls very interesting and fun times primarily in the field and lots of independence while looking over the wood supply for kimberlyclarks two wisconsin mills highlights of his career included testing two large electric chainsaws that never worked out in the duluth area getting approval to build the current champion field office west of champion along highway  which was prompted by a visit from a new kc vice president who saw the poor conditions of his old shack of an office working on getting the early version of double bottom loader trucks on the road due to poor rail service and spearheading industrys movement to more mechanized logging systems fellerbuncher prototypes in the early s saf involvement  rueben mentioned that the chapter was not too active in the s and s he did serve on a committee in conjunction with mtu to get foresters registered in the state sound familiar maybe jim meteer can shed more light on this effort other organizations in the national guard for  years joined the golden kiwanis after retirement and headed up the iron mountain and escanaba clubs and served as an elder in the presbyterian church for over  years hobbies builds and flies radiocontrolled model airplanes   researchers analyze public response to national forest issues reprinted from logging news iron mountain mi april   houghton  how do you feel about your local national forest how would you like to see it managed these are questions that few of us give much thought to but the us department of agriculture forest service is interested in trying to find the best way to gather it kathy halverson an assistant professor of natural resource policy at michigan tecnological university and deborah carr a research social scientist with the forest service are analyzing current methods for gathering community response it is hard to reach people effectively halvorsen said so she and carr are developing and testing mechanisms for involving the community houghton hancock st ignace munising ironwood and the west iron county area are involved in the evaluations in addition to learning about how to best gather information carr and halvorsen will be collecting a great deal of data during the testing as well as learning the dynamics of the communities the forest service is interested in public opinion on such issues as wildlife diversity and management as well as recreation or the amount of time trails and resources that are made available to the public although not required to gather community input annually phyllis green the forest supervisor of the ottawa national forest said her agency is always interested in peoples attitudes and concerns regarding public land management the forest service is required to involve the public every  to  years when developing their forest plan but green said we cant wait that long between talking to people if you want to know what your neighbors are thinking its best to ask them she said the standard methods for contacting the public involve direct mailings open houses and public meetings the public hearing model is frequently used according to halvorsen but she said public land managers find that each method has its strengths and weaknesses we are interested in figuring out what works best there are two other methods that are being evaluated and compared to public hearings the first is focused conversations with community groups halvorsen and a forest service employee attend meetings with groups that range from the rotary club and church groups to sportsmens clubs and environmental groups halvorsen starts the conversations with general questions aksing about the group members feelings toward their community later focusing the meeting to an open discussion about forest management with the forest service employee the second method was developed as a way to make metings fun and convenient it is called the family and community town supper and it was developed by the wisconsin clearinghouse for prevention resources in madison community members are invited to bring their families to the supper and while they eat they sit around and talk about forest management forest service employees are also in attendance observing and participating in the conversations in addition to the meetings carr is distributing a survey to seasonal and permanent residents of the test communities the survey is being used to gather the same information as the meetings and it may also be used to compare the opinions of sesonal and permanent residents although surveys are commonly used it is rare to try different approaches to ask the same group of people the same questions  carr said were hoping to be able to compare the nature of information gathered in surveys versus face to face conversations depending on the type of issue one method may be more appropriate or one method may receive a better response the ultimate question for halvorsen and carr to answer is what do people like  how are they most comfortable discussing issues that affect the national forests and public land the project is being funded by the forest service as well as through multiple funding sources from michigan tech   business meeting notes
