like to turn the call over to matt matthew rabinowitz thank you mike good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us steve chapman and i will begin with a review of our business and recent highlights for the fourth quarter after that mike will review our financial assets our results and discuss our current outlook for  and then we will be opened for questions during the call since our last earnings call we continue to make significant progress and reach several important milestones specifically we processed greater than  tests in the fourth quarter of  compared to approximately  tests processed in the fourth quarter of  an increase of approximately  these volumes include tests processed via our constellation software platform we processed  constellation units in q of  and roughly  in q of last year greater than  tests were processed in the full year  compared to  tests processed in  an increase of approximately  this includes  constellation units in  and  constellation units in  for panorama we accessioned greater than  tests compared to roughly  panorama tests accessioned in q  and roughly a  increase roughly  panorama tests were accessioned in the full year of  compared to roughly  panorama tests accessioned in  an increase of approximately  for our horizon and carrier screening panel we accessioned greater than  tests compared to roughly  in q of  an increase of approximately  greater than  horizon tests were accessioned in the full year of  compared to roughly  horizon tests accessioned in  an increase of approximately  we recently announced the launch of our evercord cord blood and tissue banking service a new cash paid product that enabled expectant parents to collect store and retrieve their newborns cord blood and tissue for potential therapeutic use in roughly  established diseases and a host of potential regenerative medicine applications this service also places natera in a position to generate the full genome of an individual very soon after birth we are also excited to preview in this call our plans for a major new addition to our fleets of noninvasive prenatal tests this new edition will identify risk for a broad range of severe conditions in fetus that have a combined incidence roughly  in  we were selected to participate in the ispy  trial in collaboration with laura esserman at the university of california san francisco one of the preeminent breast cancer trials ongoing in the united states the dnafirst study was published in genetics in medicine demonstrating the strong clinical utility of panorama as a first line fetal aneuploidy screen in a general population and addressing questions on the efficacy of genetic counseling for the general population we launched a microdeletions testing application for new and existing constellation licensees worldwide we terminated our distribution agreement with bioreference laboratories and we are now promoting panorama directly to clinicians who previously ordered this test through bioreference we are also offering our horizon carrier screen to these clinicians which we had not done previously steve will elaborate on this later in the call we were very pleased to see that cns finalized their pricing for nipt and for the separate microdeletions code at  each and number of plans have set pricing at a premium to the cms rates and so we think the cms rates is becoming a meaningful benchmark as we had expected turning to the quarter and the fullyear results we generated q total revenues of  million although this represents a roughly  decline over q  we have now largely made up for the substantial price reductions we accepted in the process of going in network by growing volume and market share gross margin came in at  in the fourth quarter down from  in the fourth quarter of  revenues and gross margins were reduced by roughly  million due to delayed payments from bioreference labs as we negotiated the conclusion of our partnership and an estimated  million in delayed insurance payments caused by moving our billing operations to austin which created a temporary delay in claims submissions we also recorded approximately  million in onetime noncash asset impairment charges to the cost of goods sold as we switched to new equipment in our lab for the launch of panorama v adjusting for these items we estimate that our revenues for the fourth quarter of  would have been  million greater or  million gross margin in the quarter would have been roughly  greater or roughly  for the full year revenues were  million compared to  million for the full year of  an increase of approximately  and gross margins were  in  compared to  in  adjusting for the onetime items mentioned above  would have been  million greater or  million gross margins would have been  greater or  we continue to see strong momentum in volume growth in the quarter and we think these new product launches will further differentiate our offering in the field the first of these product launches is evercord evercord is a new commercial offering from natera that enables expectant parents to collect store and potentially retrieve their newborns cord blood and tissue for therapeutic use in transplantation and regenerative medicine applications we think quarter is a natural addition to our current suite of products that can both enhance the services we provide with our existing base to physicians and help us win new accounts evercord also leverages our digital services to engage with the patient from the beginning of pregnancy through to the birth of the child and creates an opportunity to offer more products and services to the patient in the future nateras mission is to transform the detection and management of genetic disease the cord blood sample that we will collect can be sequenced to generate the first complete genome of an individual immediately after they are born this genome could be analyzed as part of newborn screening and could then be used to protect disease susceptibilities and guide health decisions from birth through adulthood in the immediate term evercord allows us to leverage our leadership position in prenatal screening and existing investments in our direct sales channel to offer an attractive cash paid product that can generate a longtail of our current revenues with high margins i will ask steve to elaborate more on the market and our plans later in this call we have discussed on our prior calls progress on version  of panorama and im pleased to say we successfully launched v in our lab in january v include our testing protocol for fetal q microdeletion which has improvements that we believe will reduce the false positive rate by more than a factor of  to  and increase the positive predictive value from  to about  while continuing to offer industryleading sensitivity of greater than  a key benefit of v is the savings to cost of goods sold in addition to more efficient sequencing and reagent usage v will include the readout for the q microdeletion the most prevalent condition covered by microdeletion tests on the base nipt panel roughly  of our microdeletion test orders are for q only previously when we received an order for q only we would run our full microdeletions paneling the lab and only report the q result v allows us to remove flow from our process we will continue to innovate on our panorama technology later in  we plan to launch a capability for screening twin pregnancies and introduce refinements that further reduced our retails rates and cost of goods sold we previously discussed a blended cost of goods sold targets across all our test volumes in the mid to low  range based on initiatives that were working on today the v launch is an important component of that roadmap and we remain on track for our target given the performance of our microdeletion test growing recognition from bodies such as the american college of medical genetics and the american medical association has expected data reporting out from our perspective smart trial next year  sorry and the expected data reporting out from our smart trial next year we believe that we are very wellpositioned for stable reimbursement of microdeletions over the longterm we were very pleased to see that cms finalized the price at  thats establishing a benchmark for negotiations with private payers as they set their rate plans for  our reimbursement experience with this new code is still early some plans have not yet price to code but a number of plans have set pricing at a premium to the cms rate and so we think that the cms rate is becoming a meaningful benchmark as we expected our early experience in  is that so far we are only getting paid on a small proportion of claims we dont get here data points for a large number of payers at libor and our experience with new cpt code in the past has been notifications of denied claims tend to arrive faster than allowed claims finally we have only just begun the appeal cycle on the first wave of claims that received an initial denial and we feel we have strong claims to make for coverage through the appeals process including our published test performance and support for microdeletions from the professional societies that i mentioned and our experience of appealing average risk nipt claims we found that we ultimately won coverage for about a third of those claims that were initially denied i would caution you that the results in nipt may not turn out to be predictive of our experience with microdeletions and this is reflected in our guidance for the year we do have wellestablished protocols within our insurance billing team to generate appeals that are most likely to have an impact we continue to make progress on coverage for average risk nipt we referenced the completion of dnafirst study last quarter and we were pleased to see that the study published recently in genetics in medicine out of  women included in the study panorama demonstrated a sensitivity of   out of  with no false negative and a  positive predictive value we believe this paper addressees key concerns raised by remaining payers that are not covering nipt broadly specifically related to access to genetic counseling and propensity of general population patients to followup for confirmation of the positive screening test in a survey conducted following the study nearly all patients reported sufficient time to talk to their provider and all  patients that received a positive screen followed up for confirmatory testing genetic counseling was shown to the accessible and efficient the conversation with the genetic counselor lasted roughly five minutes per patient over  health plans encompassing more than  million lives now cover nipt for all women including cigna anthem and most blues plans we believe this coverage levels show that we have absolutely made the right bet in driving low risk nipt market share and that the plan still holding out will follow this trend i referenced the cms rate for  code above but recall that  was also priced by cms at  as a result we have seen more state medicaid programs price nipt and the rates are in line with cms its too early to see the results here but longterm this is a very positive given the number of burps on the medicaid as weve discussed in the past we have a significant amount of earnings pie embedded in our existing volumes that we expect to realize as the reimbursement comes online for average risk nipt and microdeletions testing based on current reimbursement we are seeing in q on the new code we estimate that at least  microdeletion tests per quarter may not be reimbursed for nipt we estimate at least  average risk nipts per quarter may not be reimbursed given that were starting to see payers negotiate rates for the microdeletion code in the range set by cms we believe that the future cash flows from microdeletion can be significant with improvements and coverage over time just getting paid on those average risk volumes in line with our contracted rates would be a substantial benefits but we also have a much larger opportunity to grow volumes as broad coverage enables much more significant penetration of the  million annual average risk pregnancies in the united states its important to note but our part to cash flow breakeven does not require the full realization of our earnings potential that ive just described given the substantial cost reductions we are executing on and that we can support both existing test volumes and the new product launches i described with an operating expense profile that will remain roughly stable in dollar terms versus  we believe that we can be cash flow breakeven with only one of the two large remaining payers covering average risk and microdeletion average selling price of roughly  roughly onesixth of the cms rates we believe these reimbursement thresholds are very achievable we continue to have strong momentum in our constellation platform business we currently have signed deals with  licensees and im pleased to say that  labs around the world are now launched commercially with a license from natera we are working with some labs to launch commercially in the near term and some labs are waiting for later versions of our technology before launching as i mentioned at the top of the call we were pleased to launch microdeletions application in constellation which has now been launched by lifelabs in canada amongst others our work on oncology continued as expected in the quarter and we think being selected to participate as a liquid biopsy arm and the ispy  trial demonstrates the strength of our technology in cancer ispy  widely regarded as one of the preeminent breast cancer trials in the united states it is a multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational therapies combined with neoadjuvant treatment in women with newly diagnosed locally advanced breast cancer in this trial natera will be analyzing blood samples at various points throughout patient treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of liquid biopsy in monitoring tumor burden treatment response and residual disease as compared to traditional imaging methods in the trial we are first sequencing the tissue to establish the genomic profile of the patients tumor and then with a sample blood draw as defined time point in the study we are monitoring the patient with a unique set of probes that is specifically tailored to each patients tumor we believe this approach is particularly well suited for comassively multiplex pcr technology that developed for our panorama test mmpcr always us to multiplex many probes in a single reaction without splitting up the patients sample more probes in one reaction gives us many opportunities to catch even one mutated fragment in a patients sample which could allow for excellent sensitivity in addition the simplicity of this approach could allow us to offer personalized assays at very low cost of goods sold compared to most other available methods weve been using this protocol in our lung cancer work with cancer research uk and principal investigator dr charlie swanton in the tracerx study and the result in the current monitoring so far has been compelling as we have described previously dr swanton presented initial results for cell free dna analysis from the first  treatment naïve patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer earlier last year at aacr in these first  patients natera was able to detect subclonal mutations meaning that they occurred in some patient in some parts of a tumor but not in others with detected levels as low as  fraction of the cellfree dna to our knowledge this is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies showing that cellfree dna can be used to map clonal evolution and tumor heterogeneity we have now received preliminary results from the analysis of the next  patients in the study or  in total with the new addition of multiple longitudinal blood samples from patients who later went on to relapse we were able to identify which patients would relapse four to six months before the relapse was detected by traditional methods with high degree of accuracy the results have been submitted for publication and we look forward to sharing more details in the future our vision is that physicians will monitor the cancer patients for relapse using our dna test in combination with regular scans and more importantly they will start treating patients immediately upon molecular relapse instead of waiting for the tumor to appear months later on the scan we would expect improved patient outcomes in terms of progression fee and overall survival translating to real and measurable clinical utility in pursuit of this vision we expect to expand our study cohort in lung cancer and continue to explore other test indications and modalities later this year we plan to launch a commercial service across several cancers for research use only for pharmaceutical companies and academic centers focused on disease load and residual disease monitoring and cancer recurrence monitoring in this phase we will not be issuing test result to patients or physicians our plan is to compete clinical validity studies in multiple cancer types late this year and early next year after which we intend to commercially launch a clear test to patients and physicians for monitoring disease load joint therapy residual disease posttreatment and recurrence we believe we can collect insurance reimbursement at launch on the strength of clinical validity data in certain cancers where the clinical utility is clear for example in disease load monitoring cancer where traditional monitoring technologies do not work well or recurrence monitoring for cancers in which early intervention has been shown to improve survival as we launch we will work to incorporate clinical utility trials designed to measure how our test changes clinical practice finally i am very excited to give a preview of our next product launch a noninvasive prenatal test that identifies risk for severe cardiac neurological and other conditions that have a combined incidence of roughly  in  higher than that of down syndrome we expect reimbursement on this test to be strong upon commercial launch and we expect this test to be a substantial contributor to revenues in the coming years these are conditions with all design findings are not reliable indicator and current nipts do not offer screening these conditions are often associated with cognitive disabilities or class surgical intervention and may have otherwise gone undetected until after birth or into childhood early screening with our test enables patients to be referred to mfm and other specialists for targeted valuations such as fetal echocardiograms mris and targeted anatomic surveys prenatal diagnosis of birth defects allows providers and patients to plan delivery incentive equipped to provide prompt evaluation and treatment and learning about these complex genetic disorders before birth enables families to mobilize resources ask questions and anticipate future needs initially we plan to launch this test in a limited fashion with maternalfetal medicine specialists and key opinion leaders to understand the usage patterns gather feedback and continue to improve performance parameters like we do with all of our tests followed by an anticipated broader rollout in the united states later this year for competitive reasons im going to reserve further comments on the signs and test performance until we begin our initial launch of the test a little later this year i will now turn the call over to steve chapman for an update on our commercial operations steve steve chapman thanks matt we were pleased to deliver sequential growth in volumes again in the fourth quarter despite the headwind from the bioreference termination discussions which began in december i would like to provide a bit more context for our decision to shift that business to our direct channel as many of you know our initial commercial strategy in  and  was to rely on large reference laboratories for the bulk of our sales efforts in the united states and complement lab partners with a small direct sales force we quickly saw that our direct sales channel was substantially outperforming our lab partner channel we found that we could communicate the benefits of our tests incentivize unit growth and collect insurance reimbursement much more effectively and efficiently ourselves as a result we embarked on a significant expansion of our direct sales presence and we deemphasized our reliance on national lab partners that strategy has proven to be very successful as evidenced by our market share in volume growth since that time we still enjoy productive partnerships with several labs in united states and we find those work especially well when the partner lab enjoyed a strong presence in a particular market niche such as hospital systems or partner labs that plan to launch an internal test using our constellation platform we feel we can affectively cover the accounts that were previously ordering panorama through bioreference in addition we now have the opportunity to market our full suite of products including horizon and evercord to these customers which was not part of our previous distribution agreement as a result we believe the right longterm strategy is to pursue this business through our direct channel this approach will of course take time and we will not be able to replace the full bulk of volumes and revenues overnight we expect this shift to be accretive to gross margin dollars by mid to late  however i am very pleased with the progress that we have made growing the business so far in  based on our test session todate q  is on track to be our largest process volume quarter in history this performance adds to our record of accomplishment when responding to changes in the market i would like to elaborate a bit more on the evercord launch as matt described we think cord blood banking represents a natural extension of the premium segment genetic testing conversation our sales reps are already having with obgyns around the country we believe our ability to test for nearly  of the disorders treatable by cord blood is differentiated and in the first step in creating more value for patients and physicians through the combination of genetic testing at cord blood banking there are roughly  conditions that cord blood stem cells are currently used to treat and the probability of an individual acquiring one of these conditions by age  is roughly one in  others roughly  diseases  are currently screened for by our horizon carrier test by offering both horizon carrier screen and cord blood banking we can identify many families upfront who may benefit from banking their trials or a siblings cord blood this increases the clinical utility of the horizon carrier screening product and can extend the margin for cord blood to families who may not have otherwise banked in addition we are just beginning to understand the potential utility of cord blood and tissue stem cells for regenerative medicine and a host of other diseases affecting roughly one in three people finally as matt described the vision for this product is to ultimately offer whole genome analysis of the newborn child from the cord blood sample alongside the stem cell banking our approach to the business model is also different than competitors while most of the competition in the space relies on substantial investments and direct to consumer marketing we feel our trusted position in the market allows us to take a more organic approach to growing this product accordingly we do not intend to make substantial upfront investments in infrastructure or marketing spend to kick sort of volume growth but we will instead leverage our existing obgyn call point digital services platform and inside sales team to reach the customers when a patient logs on to a patient portal as part of their prenatal testing process early in pregnancy we will offer opportunities to learn more about evercord or signup via the portal in parallel we expect that only clinics will discuss evercord as an option through the course of the pregnancy and we will offer printed materials in the physicians office once a customer has expressed interest in learning more our inside sales team will follow up with a phone call to describe the process and the available options our pricing is intended to be in line with competitors which tends to be roughly  for cord blood processing and roughly  for cord blood and cord blood tissue processing thereafter we build the customer in annual fee of roughly  for cord blood storage and roughly  for storage of cord blood and tissue we are offering evercord as part of a partnership with bloodworks northwest one of the oldest and most reputable public cord blood banks in the country bloodworks was founded in  and has  years of experience processing and banking cord blood bloodworks is one of seven fda licensed public banking facilities and has a strong track record of successfully releasing nearly  cord blood samples for transplant nearly three times that of the leading private cord blood banks the longevity and proven quality of bloodworks gives evercord a strong foundation bloodworks will perform processing and testing services on cord blood samples submitted by evercord customers and will cryopreserve the banks cord blood and tissue at its seattle washingtonbased storage facility today we believe there are roughly  new cord blood storage transactions in the united states every year and roughly  of that market is controlled by two large players cord blood registry and viacord beyond that we believe the market is more fragmented among smaller players with much smaller sales and marketing efforts a substantial portion of our nipt business comes from california new jersey new york texas and florida in areas that also tend to drive demand for cord blood services so we think our existing sales coverage maps very well to this new market while we intent to exercise patients in the initial launch phase and grow organically we believe our experience winning share in a competitive nipt market bodes well for our ability to generate substantial revenue and cash flow with evercord over time finally i want to flag you recent announcement by the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists or acog around updated guidelines for carrier screen the new guidelines broaden the recommend usage of carrier screening to add spinal muscular atrophy and hemoglobinopathies for all patients we think that this recommendation could result in coverage changes and increased payment for conditions like sma and further underscores the clinical value of the conditions included in the horizon carrier screen as one of the leaders in broad panel carrier screen we expect this guideline change to drive increased horizon attachment rates as physicians shift away from ordering cystic fibrosis only toward broader panels than include sma and hemoglobinopathies a large proportion of carrier screen today remain cystic fibrosis only and we believe we still have a significant opportunity to penetrate that market with our selection of broader panels i will now hand the call over to mike brophy to review our financial results mike mike brophy thanks steve our fourth quarter financial results are included in our press release that crossed the wire earlier this afternoon our fourth quarter total revenues were  million compared to  million for the fourth quarter of  a decrease of about  as matt described there were two different unusual impacts to revenue in the quarter one was the delay in receiving payment from bioreference as we negotiated the conclusion of our partnership we received a payment of roughly  million in january and about  million of that total will be recognized on a cash received basis in q the second issue which we estimate is roughly  million related to a delay in submission of claims to insurance companies in the quarter during q and q we transitioned most of our insurance billing operation to our facility in austin texas while we anticipate this move will yield roughly  million in cost savings during  we experienced a delay in claims submissions as the new team came up to speed its important to note that this is a timing issue only and we expect to have worked off a backlog and recognize most of this revenue by the second quarter of  because we have already incurred all the cost associated with these volumes these revenues would also flow directly to gross margin panorama revenues for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  a decline of about  as matt mentioned at the top of the call q of  includes the impact of most of the pricing decreases we took to broadly go in network with payers earlier in the year and for panorama we have largely replaced that revenue with volume growth horizon revenues for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  a decrease of about  the scale of the in network price discount was larger in our carrier screening business than in panorama but we have seen robust volume growth from horizon over the past year and we expect to be more than making up that discount with volumes in  as a reminder we recognize revenue primarily on a cash received basis roughly  of our fourth quarter  roughly  of the test accessioned  sorry roughly  was derived from volumes accessioned in the quarter the balances of our revenues were derived from test accessioned in prior quarters for panorama roughly  of our  roughly  of the panorama test  panoramas on which we recognized revenue were derived from volumes accessioned in the quarter and the balance out of which were derived from test accessioned in prior periods historically about  of the revenue we drive from a cohort of tests accessioned is collected within two quarters and almost all of the revenue we derive from a cohort of tests accessioned is collected within three quarters the majority of tests accession that generate little revenue today our panorama nipt test prescribed for patients the average risk category as medical coverage policies change we expect to generate additional revenue on a much higher proportion of our accessioned test turning to revenue breakdown by channel the percentage of our total revenue attributable to our us direct sales force for the threemonth ended december   was roughly  up from  for the three months ended december   the percent of our total revenue attributable to us laboratory partners for the three months ended december   was roughly  up a  for the three months ended december   international comprised  of revenues in the quarter compared to  for the three months ended december   gross profit for the three months ended december   was  million representing a  gross margin compared to  million a  gross margin in the same period of the prior year gross margins were unusually low due to revenue issues i described and matt described and also because of several onetime noncash charges with our switch to v as matt also talked about these include accelerating the depreciation schedules in high speed machines used for panorama v and panorama v reagents research and development expenses were  million in the quarter compared to  million for the same period in  an increase of  million the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to increases in personnel related costs associated with an increase in research and development headcount selling general and administrative expenses were  million in the quarter compared to  million for the same period in  an increase of  million the increase over the prior period primarily reflects the additional personnel and facilities expenses across all of sales and ga we are satisfied with our current direct sales footprint and well continue to optimize that channel as appropriate net loss for the three months ended december   was  million or a  loss per share compared to a net loss of  million or a  loss per share in q of  weighted average shares outstanding were  million for the fourth quarter of  at the close of the quarter the company held  million in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash compared to  million as of september   we received approximately  million in cash from bioreference labs in january as payment for test accession in  which increased our cash position by that amount to  million as of december   we had drawn down  million under the  million line of credit in place with ubs at a variable interest rate of  day libor plus  basis points this line of credit was drawn down primarily to repay previous indebtedness at a significantly lower interest rate the line was secured by our investment portfolio which is designed to have yield higher returns than the borrowing rate we incur in order to fund operations turning to our future outlook i would like to provide financial guidance for fiscal year  we expect  total revenues of  million to  million cost of product revenues to be approximately  to  of revenues selling general and administrative cost to be approximately  million to  million research and development cost to be  million to  million and our cash burn to be  million to  million we are taking into account several factors with this guidance first reimbursement in the average risk nipt setting matt commented on the pace of adoption thus far where more than  million covered lives may now be reimbursed for average risk based on our conversations with payers we believe we will see significant additional payer coverage policies change in  however because a significant portion of the covered lives that still did not enjoy average risk nipt coverage reside in just two remaining large national plans we feel we must air on the side of caution as it relates to the specific timing of these coverage decisions so we are not including rapid changes in medical policies accommodating average risk in the immediate term second reimbursement for microdeletions matt reviewed the view the significant embedded earnings power we believe our microdeletions business represents and the rationale for why we feel that payers will catch up with a view that the vast majority of our physician clients that microdeletions testing is essential and medically necessary we have outlined in the past that we believe our published clinical experience coupled with data from our smart trial and the recently issued cpt code for microdeletions are the key milestones toward achieving stable reimbursement for this test the first of these milestones the new cpt code established in january is in place and as matt mentioned the early trends and pricing negotiations have been positive however we only have a few months experience building on this new code so we have limited data points so far on the percentage of cases that will be paid as matt described our early experience in  is that so far we are only getting paid on a small proportion of claims one point is that as with any new code we expect the initial payments to be delayed as payers update their fee schedule and systems to accommodate the code crucially even for the first wave of january cases we have no data points on what our success rate will be on appeal when the claim is denied consistent with our established practice of forecasting the business based on data points in hand our guidance assumes no substantial changes in the reimbursement that weve seen so far this year which implies a substantial reduction in microdeletions reimbursement compared to  third steve and matt described our decision to end our relationship with bioreference labs which represented roughly  of total volumes and roughly  of our total revenues in  we think this was clearly the right longterm decision for the business and as steve mentioned we are very encouraged by the volume growth weve seen so far in our direct channel however we cannot replace the full amount of that volume and revenue overnight assuming we retain a conservative portion of accounts bioreference was serving and a conservative horizon attachment rate we would expect that within  this decision will be accretive to gross margin dollars fourth improvements and cost of goods sold matt already covered that our target is blended cogs in the mid to low  range based on rd efforts currently underway the v launch is an important piece of that plan but the largest benefit will come from our next wave of lab automation efforts that we expect to implement in modules from early q through q  finally new product launches matt and steve talked about evercord and previewed the new addition to our nipt franchise our sales reps are training on evercord at our national sales meeting this month and we expect a broad launch in q because our strategy with this product is to leverage our existing touch point with the physician and patient at the beginning of pregnancy we expect early account conversions start generating revenue late in the year when the babies are born and we collect the upfront fees that steve described we would expect any revenues from the launch of the new addition to our nipt offering to be similarly weighted toward the end of the year as we learn from our initial rollout with key opinion leaders and then follow up with a broader launch matt described our plans on oncology regarding an rul offering followed by clear products in oncology the guidance does not include oncology revenue as we will first be focused on building the evidence as matt described one more comment on the pacing of the quarters through the year given expected delays in microdeletions payments progress on average risk nipt coverage later in the year new products generating revenue primarily in q and significant cogs reductions from automation improvements later in the year we expect revenues and gross margin improvements will be waiting for the latter part of  based on all the initiatives we have underway we expect to substantially improve our gross margins and reduce our quarterly cash burn exiting  i will now turn the call back over to matt for final comments matthew rabinowitz thank you mike i’m encouraged by the progress we made in this quarter in particular we believe the launches of evercord version  of panorama and a key new component of our noninvasive prenatal test with substantially broader coverage coupled with the selection for the ispy trial and further pay policy changes in average risk nipt represents important milestones for the company with that we are now open up to questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from steve beuchaw from morgan stanley your line is open steve beuchaw hi good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions i just wanted to clarify first of all on a couple of the assumptions first is on the carrier screening guidelines that weve seen come out recently that steve chapman referred to my sense is that youre not incorporating that as a positive for the guidance for  am i hearing you correctly there and that i hear you correctly that on carrier screening it sound like volumes will be slightly more significantly positive than pricing will be significantly negative is that correct mike brophy hi steve thanks for the question i think all of thats correct so as steve mentioned we just very recently received that news from acog and were trying to better understand exactly what the impact is to our business although we think its certainly positive so that is the incremental benefit from acog there is not factored into the guidance on your question on the mix between asp declines versus volume improvements i think youre right and i think carrier screening volumes weve got a real opportunity to grow those volumes down particularly as it relates to offering horizon to those accounts that were previously served by bioreference so i think thats also a correct assumption steve beuchaw so then if i take a step back and i include that information and i consider theres probably order of magnitude  million to  million of pressure from brl anticipated in the  guidance i get to a view that the underlying panel growth in revenue terms is relatively modest and so that makes me wonder  well maybe i was a little too whether is a little too optimistic on pano pricing in  so can you just talk a little bit about how you expect pricing to evolve over the course of the year now that were  seen a number of quarters through the transition to in network thanks matthew rabinowitz so i think mike you can take that first mike brophy just to comment on pano revenues i think thats rightly so if you think about that downdraft from bioreference i think you have that roughly right although i think its  if you do  of our  revenues you get to number slightly above  million and then if you anticipate a growth i think the target that we need to fill is slightly larger than that so thats the – thats just the background on the financials i’ll let matt comment more on just kind of pano uptake and other parts of your question there matthew rabinowitz well you can do the math so i think you got a reasonable sense of what were assuming in the model to a large extent the model is driven by our conservatism related to payers coming in to cover low risk we are seeing steady growth in volumes in panorama for both high risk and low risk and as steve mentioned weve seen really great numbers in q and it looks like q is actually going to be a record volume quarter despite the bioreference reduction in volume however we are just being prudent in modeling volumes through the rest of the year because we cant say what the big payers like aetna and united are going to do we are seeing payers transition to be covering low risk sort of on a steady flow every few months we see payers come online and you know now that weve got more than  of payers covering low risk the train is very clearly left the station this is definitely the right bet that we made and the other payers are going to come in line in time  well i should can say are i mean we believe pretty strongly that they will come in line i mean if it seems very hard for them to hold out with more than  of payers covering and the trend just continuing every few months however in our guidance we got to be a little bit conservative in modeling the uptake that we would expect to happen in low risk when all of the payers come online and when the doctors can expect that a low risk test order is going to be covered by insurance mike brophy i think steve maybe one more comment for  and i know you know that’s for just for others listening our microdeletions revenue is recognized through our panorama revenue line and so if you think about modeling panorama revenues our comments on the reimbursement we’ve seen so far microdeletions would certainly affect that panorama revenue line for  steve beuchaw thanks so much really appreciate the help there operator thank you our next question comes from bill quirk from piper jaffray your line is open bill quirk great thanks good afternoon i guess first question is just trying to bridge consensus which was at  with the mid part of guidance is about  million mike if i’m hearing correctly bioreference is about  of that and so i guess first question is microdeletions essentially assume to be down about  million or is there something else here that i guess history is missing as i’m trying to bridge from guidance to where consensus was mike brophy yes i think the main bridge points here are bioref in order of magnitude are the early experience we’re seeing on the  the new code for microdeletions in  that is by far the biggest delta and then second is bioreference which i think youre roughly in the zone on bill so in the background we also have carrier screening improving as weve alluded to on the call but really the main delta is the reduction in asp that we’re seeing on microdeletions so far this year on the new code bill quirk got it okay and not to acute on this but if microdeletions was greater than bioreference i guess we normalized for that we actually would have implied fairly decent revenue growth and guidance that is and so is that a function of some of the medicaid states coming on and pricing tests that are perhaps in your slight upside surprise so trying to bridge this a bit mike brophy yes i understand so what’s on the positive side of that would be carrier screening revenues two components there one is just the volume growth opportunities steve alluded to it in his section we still think we have a lot of greenfield there with the cystic fibrosis only population to convert those we got a real opportunity in carrier screening as a result of the  our ability to offer that to bioreference accounts and that’s one and i think you’re right you do have incremental improvements and reimbursement assumed in our guidance for both average risk and then medicaid coming on and nipt and then finally we talk about evercord and the new nipt extension on this call and we do model revenues from both of those products in  although it’s late in the year bill quirk got it and then just last question from me here i guess getting to the comment about that one q volumes they hold could be kind of a record for you which is obviously good to hear that said it looks us like nipt was pretty flat sequentially i think you accessioned little over  tests in each quarter maybe just add a little bit of color here on such performance i suspect bioreference may have been a factor here but again any additional color will be great thanks mike brophy yes absolutely so i’ll just give a couple comments and then steve will provide some color so i think we started breaking on constellation units on this call to kind of help you get more color on this topic as we see labs transition from testing our business which would counter tests accessioned and when they started launching constellation those are constellation units so if you kind of normalize for those things we grew panorama units by little over  units in the quarter so thats just kind of just level setting on the map with the constellation units going in there as well so steve what other comments would you add to that steve chapman yes so i think it’s really three or four things there that were contributing the first is bioreference we did see downward draft in the volume from the channel business overall in q that mashed some of the direct growth in panorama as mike indicated there was a transition to constellation for a certain portion of the units that is further masking growth additionally we put a larger emphasis on growth of our carrier screening product as we started to gain more traction there we are also putting a larger emphasis on generating more units from our committed customers and from customers that have tried us in previous quarters as opposed to just continuing to bring on new customers and so we starting to see the results of that activity in q but that was a strategy that we initiated right around the beginning of q bill quirk okay got it thanks for the color guys operator thank you our next question comes from indiscernible from robert w baird your line is open unidentified analyst hi guys thanks for the question you guys talked about on last quarters call expecting  revenue growth to track volume growth does that still hold true as we think about the volume versus asp puts and takes in your guidance mike brophy yes so i think the first driver katherine is just the reimbursement on microdels will affect that as weve commented the microdeletions revenue is flowing through the panorama line so we would expect that to affect the panorama revenue asp as you calculate in our financials so with that level set matt if you had other comments matthew rabinowitz sure i dont want to be cute but we were looking at the timing and the comment that we made was by the end of  we would expect the reimbursement to be in a roughly steady state at which point we would expect revenues to be tracking volumes more closely so we are seeing reduction due to microdeletions reimbursement we are seeing what we expect to be ongoing improvement in nipt reimbursement and when this is sort of flashed out we do expect that the numbers that we provided for the steady state revenues in the asps will be tracking the growth and volume in fact i think we are actually in a much better shape in the longterm than where we were when we made this comment because at the time that we made this comment we expected that the order in reimbursement for nipt would be about  and we would add about  on to that for microdeletions what we are seeing now is that for the cms pricing we expect in the longterm to do a whole lot better than that you know with the microdeletions code at  we think that the longterm additive affect on the microdeletions could be much more than  so we are going to take some time for these new code issues to stabilize and for the payers to start to reimburse microdeletions but that longterm trajectory where we expect the revenues to track the volumes is absolutely still what we believe to be the case unidentified analyst okay thats helpful and it seems like you guys made some pretty meaningful improvements on recognizing revenue on test that have been processed in the period  for panorama and earlier in the year it was more on the low  so just curious as if there were unique dynamics going on in the fourth quarter if thats a new trend that will continue going forward matthew rabinowitz yes i think the trend there is when we went in network with the payers early in the year and we got some experience with those payers we were able to negotiate terms on kind of bolus of claims of older claims that we had held up and not be paid on that were holding in the appeal queue and so we really get those in q and q so that inflated the number of volumes on which we recognize revenue that were actually accessioned in prior periods the same hold true for bioreference as we switch to an accrual basis for bioreference in starting in q and then into q we were also receiving payments for the cash recognized units from prior in the year and that again depressed that number so i think going forward i think that is a steady state number unidentified analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mark massaro from canaccord genuity your line is open mark massaro hi guys thank you for taking the questions your opex in q i think was  million if i got that number correctly can you speak to your comfort level around that level hovering roughly in that ballpark throughout the course of  and maybe the cadence of how that might change throughout the year mike brophy yes i mean  mark thanks for the question i think the guidance incorporates what we think in terms of the total sga through the year i think that cadence will be something that remains relatively steady through the course of the year there are not massive initiatives that wouldn’t cause meaningful changes in different quarters there so roughly stable through the course of the year and again roughly stable on dollar terms versus  why is that is because were comfortable with our sales footprint and the investment we’ve made in our austin facilities for example so we are feel like we’re ready to go with this expense base mark massaro great and going back to the guidance i understand that you guys are the speaking to air on the side of caution and in your prepared remarks said that youre not including rapid changes in the immediate term can you just clarify if those comments are specific to microdels are you also including average risk nipt in that bucket mike brophy no those comments are actually specific to average risk nipt so we do expect to see continued improvement in the reimbursement for average risk nipt through the course of the year but we just dont expect a sea change in the reimbursement and that’s great for average risk nipt in the immediate term and as we discussed on prior calls once you see changes in positive coverage decisions it takes a bit of time to  for those decisions to flow through the system and actually show up in our revenues so that’s an impact for nipt for microdeletions we don’t anticipate  our guidance does not contemplate improvements in the reimbursements weve seen so far even though we may see that as we have an opportunity to execute on appeals and we are able to get more data points back in mark massaro okay great and then on the new product launch on the cardiac and neurological condition given the fact that it is higher incident than down and in most other genetic abnormalities can you just speak maybe to the size of the market opportunity youre seeking to address and maybe given the higher prevalence should we be thinking of a premium price relative to your other tests matthew rabinowitz i love that question steve do you want to take and then i’ll make some comment steve chapman yes sure i’ll take that so i think initially as we described we plan on launching to maternal fetal medicine specialist in key opinion leaders while there are some disorders on the panel that are relevant for ultrasound findings a large portion of the panel has no prior indications so we think ultimately this is a test that once we go through the phase launch it have support from the appropriate key opinion leaders could be a routine test that is offered alongside panorama as we look back at the launch of microdeletions for example we do have a very high attachment rate there to our base aneuploidy test so i think in the longterm this is a test that can generate substantial revenue we think on commercial launch there will be a good revenue opportunity with the premium priced product mike brophy thanks steve so i’ll just add to that we’re being relatively conservative in the guidance there as well because we’re assuming that the majority of the revenue will come later this year we do expect that this should be well reimbursed right out of the gate upon the commercial launch and what you say is exactly right this is very high incidence serious conditions that when does occur in the screen fold so from our perspective this should be a really big deal we have just learnt that the right approach to these things is to offer them to the key opinion leaders before you try to rapidly change the field you want to get the key opinion leaders comfortable with this new technology you want to get the doctors understanding your capabilities and also you want to be flushing out some of the technical issues that are involved in launching a new product especially in new product thats pretty cutting edge like this once we flush those out we expect that the volume upticks will be substantial and i think youve seen some sort of points of reference here youve seen the uptick of the microdeletions offering youve seen the uptick of the broader horizon carrier panel and given the importance of this test we expect the uptick should be really substantial in the coming year so this is we think going to be a big deal mark massaro great thank you and my last question is by chance have you seen any change in competitive dynamics obviously we have labcorp by sequenom just curious if youre seeing any changes relative to maybe even a year ago as it relates to market share or competitive activity steve chapman yes ill take that we haven’t seen significant changes i mean obviously there was the sequenom of acquisition you referenced weve been competing against sequenom and labcorp for a long time and we haven’t really seen changes there even though there was a change in ownership there is a couple other i think changes in product offerings for example roche is now offering the sort of good start carrier test we havent seen that broadly within our customer accounts but we know its out there but overall it continues to be a pretty competitive space and we continue to compete on a daily basis very aggressively for new business matthew rabinowitz yes so i would say that natera has competed extremely affectively if you look at the volumes for q weve grown through that loss of volume from bioreference very quickly so i was very happy to see that it’s difficult to say exactly what competitive dynamics are in place but it’s possible that part of nateras growth is because we have removed the shackles from some of the salespeople who were dealing with the channel conflicts with bioreference so people are selling much more easily and it’s much more streamline process without dealing with those channel conflict issues and the other thing is it possible that because sequenom is no longer in the market and has kind of been taken under labcorp we are seeing much more powerful position for our salespeople being very clearly by far the leader in nipt testing and being sort of the strongest player out there that’s offering broad carrier testing together with a very strong differentiated nipt test so some of those factors might be giving rise to the great numbers that we seen in q its just difficult to say exactly what the factors are mark massaro okay thank you operator thank you and i am showing no further questions from our phone lines ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in todays conference this
