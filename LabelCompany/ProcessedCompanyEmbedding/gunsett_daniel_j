glasshelpful reviews joslyn law firmmargo m ratedi am a current client of mrjoslyn before initially retaining an attorney i spoke with many highly recommend lawyers and after my first phone conversation with mrjoslyn i knew i wanted no one else handling my case but him brian spent over  minutes speaking with me and for the first time in all of my calls with other attorneys asked questions to get to know me not only as a client but as person because of that brian was able to have my case sentenced to treatment in lieu of a conviction so that my mistake would not cost me my future and all my hard work and education would not be gone with a felony conviction his office staff was amazing to me respectful helpful and accommodating as i was traveling from out of state for my court case on top of everything else brian and his staff made financial arrangements with myself and my family that are unheard of i can tell you that no other attorney would do such i was arrested for a probation violation in my case and was worried brian and his firm would not accept me again as a client as i still owe on my past balance so i did not contact him brian saw my name on the docket when i was in jail for arrangement came and found me handled my case so i could post a bond not only did he do that without mention of money a past balance and most importantly without judgment he went and spoke with my family in detail for over  minutes in the courthouse as i am sure i am not alone in this but my family has suffered as much as i have if not more through this ordeal knowing that brian and his firm were there for them to answer any and all questions and re assure them that he would do any and everything to make sure i was ok and safe throughout the process is purely priceless i would recommend mrjoslyn and his firm to anyone dealing with a criminal case you will not find another lawyer that is so nonjudgmental hardworking compassionate and is truly working for your best interest at all costs i thank mrjoslyn and his firm for everything that they have done for me and continue to docecil  geiser llpkvanmarm ratedi was involved as a pedestriani was involved as a pedestrian in an auto accident back in ohio but subsequently moved to another state when the drivers insurance company kept stalling me claiming they wanted to personally settle with me but drug out my claim for too long a time i decided to take stronger action i retained a small firm to handle my case after six months of what i thought was time being spent negotiating a settlement for me so i could pay off my medical bills for one thing i found that the attorney had sat on my information while i believed she was being an advocate for me she did absolutely nothing but waste my time i had documented injuries the other insurance company never denied liability outstanding unpaid medical bills ongoing pain and need for physical therapy a lose of income a loss of a career and a business i had built up  years all due to the injury the lawyer handling my case totally ignored medical diagnoses from outstanding orthopedic surgeons and other medical professionals totally ignored all medical evidence and prognoses and dropped my case i was in shock and insultedi researched for a more competent law firm after a recommendation from a friend i had known for thirty years and had been involved in a personal injury case with c  g representing her i picked cecil  geiser who are known for excellent service to their clients  the attorneys from cecil  geiser have had the difficult task of handling my case from a distance since i now live in a different state they have handled each step of the process with patience compassion courtesy and professionalismcecil  geiser llpbike ratedin may of  i was in an accin may of  i was in an accident while riding my bike a dog ran out into the road and caused me to have a serious fall i have no memory of the accident luckily i was with friends that took care of me while i was unconscious and waiting for the ambulance subsequently i made several unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the owner of the dog i took my case to an attorney in an attempt to communicate once again with the owner of the dog but the attorney refused my case i then talked to mike geiser of cecil  geisermike geiser accepted my case shortly thereafter he did some investigating and was able to contact the appropriate party that insured the dog it took several years for me to recover but through the entire process i felt i was working with the best possible attorney for my personal injury he was very thorough he understood all aspects of the law concerning my case even when the opposing insurance representatives did not he spent time with me explaining the pros and cons on my situation his paralegal did an excellent job of organizing my medical files which were quite extensive she promptly responded to emails and stayed on top of my deadlines recently my case was successfully resolved until you work with someone you really do not know what kind of service you will receive and i can tell you that i received excellent legal service with mike geiser michael r szolosi sr columbus ohio lawyerkati n ratedi was given attorney siewerts name by a very good friend of mine i had never been in any kind of trouble and was scared to death to even discuss what may happen to me if found guilty because i am innocent of course i didnt take the referral right away in fact i called several different law firms and discussed my situation with them and they all sounded like robots all they wanted was my money every one of them wanted a huge retainer fee as well as making it very clear that during the process of a trial the fees were sure to add on not only did they assure me id be paying tons of moneythey all advised me they would take the best deal the judge gave on the first try and warned me id be on probation or definitely do community service finally i called attorney mike siewert and he immediately gave me peace of mind not only did he allow me to retain him for what i had availablehe offered a payment agreement according to what i could afford on top of the very personable conversation and the flexibile rates attorney siewert has taken the time to fight my case he did whatever it took to get the results we were looking for and he wasnt going to stop until he did i will always recommend mike siewert for an attorney to anyone in needcecil  geiser llpjennifer r ratedin july of  i was in a serious pedestrian accident while walking on the sidewalk a motorcyclist was hit by a car and came up on the sidewalk and drove right into me for several weeks i was hospitalized  in a rehab center and unable to care for my daughter as a single parent it was my worst nightmare i was hurt stressed worried and all i wanted to do was focus on getting better and getting home to my daughter mike geiser allowed me to do just that i let the experts do their job so i did not have to worry about how the medical bills were going to get paid or what i needed to do they took care of everything i don’t wish that situation on anyone but if you find yourself in a similar situation cecil  geiser are the ones that will step in and hold your hand through the process with care i am very happy with my settlement and will be forever grateful for all that they have done for me i don’t know how i would have gotten through all of this without their supportdodgion jeremyjohnscior rated i must admit that mr dodg i must admit that mr dodgion seemed a bit less concerned about my case in the beginning than i did however later i realized this was simply because i had never faced the allegations i had been facing he seemed quite strict in the thouroughness of his staff however his results were just as i asked i in fact had been writing childrens stories at the time and had devoted one called the tyronnasaurus and the bunny rabbit and devoted it to his daughters who he had introduced me to in his initial consultation he had in fact been highly recommended from amongst a prosecuter i know of and also another defense attorney amidst a sea of trouble he seemed a solid rock if not a beacon during a time of troubles and stormy weather in my life if you are a christian or whatever your belief might be as your faith shall guide ye mr jeremy dodgion esq shall see ye through the storm of your life bless him cecil  geiser llpronald b ratedi highly recommend michael geiser mr geiser represented me in an auto accident that happened in december  the other driver was at fault and did not have insurance my auto insurance tried to rip me off first by not giving me a fair compensation for my car that was totaled then they stated that they did not pay medical bills it was at that point that i retained mr geiser mr geiser came to our house to explain everything he was extremely prompt in answering any questions or concerns he also encountered many difficulities with the insurance company but his patience and persistance paid off my case has been settled and i am extremely happy with the results my wife is still under medical treatment so her case is still pending but mr geiser has been able to get the insurance company to reimburse me for the medical bills again i would strongly recommend cecil  geisergreco anthony attorneyjennifer h ratedmy husband and i decided after his divorce that we needed to hire a different attorney to represent us for termination of spousal support due to cohabitation we first met with a private investigator who referred us to tony after hearing our case after a short time in our meeting with tony we knew he was the right attorney for us he is very knowledgeable has a great team of attorneys  staff and will go the extra mile to get the job done cohabitation is one of the hardest things to prove but with our private investigator  tonys expertise i am happy to say we won we are currently back in court due to his exwife appealing the decision but with tony and his team i know we will be just fine if you need an attorney to handle your case look no further he is your guycecil  geiser llpamdisabato ratedi like to call mike geiser my guardian angel i have been in two car accidents and he has represented me both timesi was in a serious car accident a couple years ago with my  month old baby from day one mike came to my house to help i had no idea what what my future would hold not being able to walk and having to take care of my new baby through the entire time mike was by my side he never let me down i knew he was always a phone call away and he would be there for me everytime in the end all my medical bills were paid for and a settlement that changed my life if i never met mike im not sure what would have happened i would highly recommend mike geiser someone i call my guardian angel a friend  and someone who changed my lifethanks mikewaters law llceric b ratedi dont usually leave reviewsi dont usually leave reviews especially for something so personal but i think this can help other people so here i am mr waters helped me tremendously with a frustrating tax problem that had been plaguing me for years within days of our initial conversation he had things moving along with the irs to get the issue resolved i wish i could explain how much stress was relieved when he took over my tax case he straightened out tax issues for my business and for me personally and now i can move on with my life and put this behind me if you have a tax
