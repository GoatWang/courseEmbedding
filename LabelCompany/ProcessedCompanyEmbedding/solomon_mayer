melvyn j falis and john e bersin of counsel for appellees before newman chief judge feinberg and mclaughlin circuit judges mclaughlin circuit judge background a the players  samuel peltz is an investor in commodities commodities unlike stocks comprise various items such as agricultural products metals or energy investors purchase commodities contracts which represent a specific amount of the commodity one of the principal markets where investors trade commodities contracts is the commodities exchange comex in new york  shb commodities inc is a registered futures commission merchant fcm a firm authorized to deal on the comex it is owned by defendants solomon shlomo and bezalel buzzy mayer as a futures commission merchant shb solicits or accepts orders to buy or sell commodities for future delivery in that regard shb accepts money or extends credit to margin to guarantee or to secure any resulting trades see  usc §  peltz maintained an account at shb through which he negotiated commodity trades  ludwig leo weingarten although not a party to this litigation occupies center stage weingarten was a floor broker on the comex ie one who literally stands on the floor of the comex and does the work of buying and selling the commodities he was never employed by shb b the play  on march   in the morning hours before the comex opened peltz and weingarten met for coffee in lords coffee shop in lower manhattan apparently the two had never had prior business dealings despite their unfamiliarity peltz agreed to let weingarten sell copper futures contracts from the floor of the comex that morning against peltzs account at shb peltz never gave weingarten written authority to make trades against or otherwise control his account and shb never received any written authorization  weingarten and peltz also agreed to short sell copper futures contracts ie to sell contracts that one does not yet own one who sells such a phantom contract is said to be in a short position the short seller gambles that the market will decline and he thus expects to purchase a contract sometime in the future at a price lower than that at which he sold it this will cover his short position and he will realize a profit  the profit potential is very high there is of course the unhappy possibility that the price of copper will rise resulting in serious economic loss weingarten testified that he and peltz conspired to short sell copper contracts and to ensure a profit also conspired to then depress the copper market with high volume offers to sell contracts once the price was depressed peltz was to buy these artificially reducedprice contracts to cover the short position created by weingarten and realize a great profit  the two conspirators disagree as to how much authority peltz gave weingarten peltz says that the coffee shop agreement was that weingarten would trade  contracts at prices no lower than  peltz adds that he made clear that his position was to be flat at the end of the trading day ie the short position was to be fully covered weingartens version on the other hand was that peltz gave him unfettered discretion to make whatever trades he thought would be profitable  after the kaffeeklatsch peltz repaired to the shb offices and weingarten to the copper pit on the floor of the comex peltz took a chair next to shbs order clerk in front of the commodities ticker where he could observe the days trade in commodities during the morning weingarten phoned shb and an employee named eis answered weingarten explained that he would be doing paper for peltz that day to which eis responded okay as soon as the copper futures market opened weingarten began to sell huge amounts of copper contracts  throughout the fateful day peltz and weingarten kept in telephonic contact shb recorded these conversations while it is difficult to discern the precise conversations it is clear that peltz knew that weingarten was selling more than  contracts and was doing it at prices lower than  indeed just minutes after the market opened weingarten was selling copper contracts at  and  peltz maintained a tally sheet throughout the trading day and he noted that at  am most of weingartens trades were at prices below  and that by  am weingarten had already sold over  contracts  weingarten from the trading floor repeatedly warned peltz to start buying contracts to cover the mushrooming short position in the middle of the trading day the situation began to turn sour a jittery peltz warned weingarten to be careful because people on the floor were beginning to realize that things  were not normal at  am the two spoke weingarten said that he sold twelvefourteen hundred contracts peltz responded that he bought only  back and forth calls continued in this vein the numbers were not adding up  it was apparent by midafternoon that the shortselling plan was going awry weingarten told peltz that comex officials threatened to remove him from the floor unless weingarten could maintain  in his own personal trading account peltz immediately wrote weingarten a personal check keeping weingarten on the trading floor and breathing new life into the scheme  at  pm buzzy mayer shbs coowner first learned that shb had acted as clearing agent for a significant amount of copper contracts he also found out that weingarten was the seller and that the sales were against peltzs account mayer went looking for weingarten who told mayer that he had been selling all day for peltz and was now a few contracts short  at  pm comex officials summoned a representative of shb to inform the company that as the clearing member of the exchange involved in all these sales it now faced a margin call for the shortselling of copper futures contracts at  pm mayer called peltz and asked him to describe the agreement with weingarten peltz stated that he had agreed to only  or  contracts but he would accept more from weingarten so long as peltzs position remained flat for the day  by days end weingarten had sold a total of  contracts against peltzs shb account peltz for his part placed buy orders through shb for  contracts in sum peltz failed to purchase the more than  contracts necessary to cover fully the short position weingarten had created  shortly after realizing that he had not fully covered his short position peltz telephoned shb to protest that weingarten had no authority to make trades against peltzs account and he disclaimed the short sales for which he had not purchased offsetting contracts at  pm shb tried to disavow formally or dk literally doesnt know the trades with comex comex officials rejected this effort c denouement  the next day the comex was closed for good friday weingarten testified that on saturday peltz called first to threaten him and then to bribe him weingarten testified that peltz offered to take care of him if weingarten would just say he went crazy the following monday shb officials issued a margin call of over  million against peltzs account at shb peltz could not meet the call forcing shb to purchase the contracts the net result was a charge to peltzs account of   peltz sued shb the mayer brothers and weingarten but soon dropped the suit against weingarten peltz asserted claims against shb and the mayers for various violations of the commodities exchange act cea and new york common law claiming that shb was liable for the loss incurred when it purchased the copper contracts to cover peltzs short position the theory driving peltzs case was that shb was responsible for the short position weingarten created because under  cfr §  shb should have received from peltz either written or specific authorization for the sales peltz argued that shb wrongfully cleared weingartens trades thereby defrauding peltz  peltz claimed that shb was liable under § b of the cea for willfully deceiving him regarding the disposition of an order see  usc § b peltz also alleged that shb criminally intended to convert peltzs money and wilfully induced the commission of a violation of cea regulations see  usc §  et seq peltz added state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty breach of contract and fraud  after a nineday bench trial the district court rejected peltzs claims concluding that peltz had lied when he said he limited weingartens authority to make only  sales at prices exceeding  the court rejected peltzs federal claims finding that peltz failed to show that shb intended to defraud peltz  the district court also rebuffed peltzs fraud contract and fiduciary duty claims reasoning that there was no intent to deceive and that peltz failed to show the breach of any duty arising out of the relationship or the contract between himself and shb any losses the district court concluded were caused by peltz and weingartens illconceived scheme to manipulate the copper markets to allow peltz to reject certain transactions undertaken by his independent roguefcm weingarten only after peltz concluded that the transactions would be unprofitable the district court wrote would be to offer peltz a no risk winwin situation   peltz appeals arguing that shb is responsible for the margin call because under  cfr §  shb never had proper authorization from peltz to accept weingartens trades against peltzs accounts the central question on this appeal is whether shb had sufficient authority to clear weingartens trades against peltzs account discussion  i the authority of a customers thirdparty designee  section ba of the cea makes it unlawful for shb to make trades against a customers account without the customers permission  usc § b peltz concludes that he is not responsible for the margin call shb charged to his account because shb failed to get permission under  cfr §  before shb cleared weingartens trades this failure peltz contends shifts liability exclusively to shb shb responds that weingarten had sufficient authority to make the trades and therefore peltz must pay the debit to his account  rule  was promulgated under the cea and states that  no futures commission merchant introducing broker or any of their associated persons may directly or indirectly effect a transaction in a commodity interest for the account of any customer unless before the transaction the customer or person designated by the customer to control the accounta specifically authorized the futures commission merchant introducing broker or any of their associated persons to effect the transaction a transaction is specifically authorized if the customer or person designated by the customer to control the account specifies  the precise commodity interest to be purchased or sold and  the exact amount of the commodity interest to be purchased or sold or b authorized in writing the futures commission merchant  to effect transactions in commodity interests for the account without the customers specific authorization   cfr §  in sum an fcm may execute trades for a customer only after the customer or someone designated by the customer to control the account specifically authorizes the trades under § a or provides the fcm with written authorization for the trades under § b  it is clear from the rather straightforward language of the regulation that an fcm needs written authorization to make trades only when the fcm has not received specific  authorization for the transaction see  cfr § b under the regulation only two persons can give such specific  authorizationthe customer himself or the person designated by the customer to control the account  cfr §  peltz adds a requirement appearing nowhere in the rule that the designation of a person to control the account must be by a written power of attorney from this peltz reasons that because he did not execute such written power of attorney and did not authorize the trades in writing under b shb should not have made the trades peltzs interpretation of the regulation does not bear scrutiny  everyone agrees that peltz did not give shb a written authorization to make the trades nor a written power of attorney allowing weingarten to make trades on his behalf while lack of written authorization for shb to make the trades means that shb could not execute the transactions under b the lack of a written power of attorney designating weingarten to control the account does not rule out the possibility that shb had specific  authorization from the customers designee to accept the orders under § a nothing in the regulation or in the caselaw interpreting subdivision a requires that before an fcm makes trades specifically authorized by a designee the fcm has to get written authorization from a customer appointing the designee while written authorization may help an fcm to determine whether an individual is indeed a person designated by a customer to control the account it is not a legal necessity  peltz argues that this lax interpretation runs contrary to that announced by the commodity futures trading commission the entity responsible for policing the comex and those who trade in futures in matter of heitschmidt see matter of heitschmidt  transfer binder commfutlrep cch p  at  cftc nov   in heitschmidt the cftc announced that  a liability analysis under commission rule  focuses on two issues  whether there was a written power of attorney in effect at the time of the transaction at issue and if not  whether the transaction was specifically authorized by the customer in advance of its execution see wolken v refco inc  transfer binder commfutlrep cch p  at  cftc july   under rule  a customers oral grant of general discretion to an account executive is irrelevant to the analysis of liability because the rule renders such agreements void  id peltz concludes from this statement that a broker accepting trades from a person other than the customer without written authorization commits a prima facie violation of the cea appellants brief at p  peltz misinterprets heitschmidt  heitschmidt involved unauthorized trading by an associated person ap a person associated with an fcm of both discretionary and nondiscretionary accounts the cftc found that the aps trades against the discretionary account violated rule  because despite the customers oral revocation of written authorization it had sent the ap to make the trades under b the ap made trades without consulting the customer p  at  as to the nondiscretionary accounts the commission found that the ap had made trades beyond the customers general instructions  heitschmidt thus stands for the unexceptional proposition that an fcm or ap must have written authorization to make trades against a customers account when those trades are not specifically authorized by the customer or one designated by the customer to control the account peltz confuses the role the ap played in heitschmidt with the role played by weingarten in the coffee shop scheme the ap like an fcm had to follow the instructions of a customer or one designated by the customer to control an account these instructions had to come in one of two forms  a specific authorization under a or  a written authorization under b the heitschmidt ap failed to get written or specific authorization for the trades he made thus making him liable  weingarten on the other hand was acting as a designee not an ap or an fcm under the regulation and heitschmidt all shb needed before clearing the trades was either written or specific authorization from the customer peltz or the customers designee it did not however need a written authorization from peltz giving weingarten a power of attorney over the account the only question for us now is in the absence of a written power of attorney from peltz appointing weingarten as his designee what type of proof will suffice for purposes of exonerating shb to show that weingarten was in fact the designee authorized to order trades against peltzs account  there is no question that an fcm may make trades ordered by someone other than the customer himself when that someone is designated by the customer to control the customers account see  cfr §  the fcm may make trades ordered by the third party who has either actual or apparent authority to make the trades see sansom refining co v drexel burnham lambert inc  transfer binder commfutlrep cch p  at  cftc july   affd in part revd in part and remanded sub nom drexel burnham lambert inc v cftc  fd  dccir  generally before accepting trades from a third party the fcm must make a reasonable inquiry into the nature and extent of the individuals authority see id p  at  apparent authority exists when a principal either intentionally or by lack of ordinary care induces the fcm to believe that an individual has been authorized to act on its behalf id citing wheeler v investment managers commodity corp  transfer binder commfutlrep cch p  at  cftc oct   actual authority is created by direct manifestations from the principal to the agent and the extent of the agents actual authority is interpreted in the light of all circumstances attending these manifestations including the customs of business the subject matter any formal agreement between the parties and the facts of which both parties are aware demarco v edens  fd   d cir  it is not clear from the record that weingarten had apparent authority to make the trades we cannot say that peltzs statements and actions reasonably induced shb to believe that weingarten had the power to make the trades however we hold that the district courts factual findings support the conclusion that at the coffee shop peltz granted weingarten the actual authority to sell all the copper futures contracts in question  only two people know what transpired across the table at lords coffee shop on that illfated morning peltz maintained that he allowed weingarten to sell only  contracts at  or better weingarten had a different version that peltz granted him absolute discretion to make the trades the district court weighed the testimony made credibility determinations and found that the events of that morning did not support peltzs version of the meeting  peltz admits that he granted weingarten authority to make some trades it was clear to the district court that weingartens authority was basically unfettered from the first trades to the last conversation of the day between the conspirators peltz knew full well that weingarten was selling far more than  contracts and at prices below  with every phone call peltz received instructions from weingarten to cover the swelling short position peltz did nothing to stop weingarten from trading furthermore peltz expressly told buzzy mayer that he was willing to accept more than  trades from weingarten so long as his position remained flat for the day the district court was not in error when it concluded based on this abundant evidence that weingarten had the actual authority to make the trades in question  in some cases the next question would be whether shb made a reasonable inquiry into the extent of weingartens authority or merely acquiesced in weingartens representations that he had actual authority we need not answer this question in this particular case where it is clear that the designee had actual authority from the customer it would be superfluous as a legal matter but perhaps not as a practical matter to require an fcm to make an inquiry into the designees authority  in cases of apparent authority it makes eminently good sense to require a reasonable inquiry before imposing liability on the principal when an fcm relies on a defense of reasonable inquiry that revealed apparent authority we accept the defense for two reasons  to encourage the fcm to make a reasonable inquiry thereby reducing the frequency of unauthorized trades and  it is unjust to hold an fcm liable after it acted in a reasonably prudent fashion  these policy matters do not concern us when there is actual authority firstand most basicallywhen there is actual authority there is no unauthorized trade to avoid second it is unsound and illogical to hold an fcm liable when its failure to perform a reasonable inquiry did not result in the acceptance of an unauthorized trade hence we hold that courts need determine if there was a reasonable inquiry only when the question is whether the designee had apparent rather than actual authority  we hasten to add lest fcms become lackadaisical in their everyday duties that as a practical matter fcms should not gamble with the possibility that the designee has actual authority a reasonable inquiry can never hurt admittedly on some occasions it will be unnecessary because the inquiry reveals that a customer granted actual authority to the designee however there will be instances in which a designee has only apparent authority and the only defense from liability for the fcm will be a reasonable inquiry  it follows therefore that shb is not liable for the margin call shb was specifically authorized to accept every trade made by peltzs designated agent weingarten hence shb had proper authorization to complete weingartens transactions under  cfr § a ii the in pari delicto defense  even if peltz had not given weingarten actual authority to make the trades shb should bear no responsibility for the margin call peltz was at least equally culpable with shb for creating the short position thus shb is not liable because in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis when there is mutual wrongdoing the law favors the defending party see bateman eichler hill richards inc v berner  us    s ct    l ed d    the in pari delicto defense is used sparingly and is narrowly defined in litigation under federal regulatory statutes see perma life mufflers inc v international parts corp  us    s ct    l ed d   not recognizing defense in antitrust action ross v bolton  fd   d cir recognizing defense in securities case to ensure that the defense is narrowly applied in securities cases the supreme court in bateman eichler hill richards inc v berner set forth a twopart test for the application of the defense in private causes of action under the securities law bateman eichler  us at   sct at  the bateman eichler court noted that the doctrine may bar an action where  as a direct result of his own actions the plaintiff bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the violations he seeks to redress and  preclusion of suit would not significantly interfere with the effective enforcement of the securities laws and protection of the investing public id  the first prong of the test sets forth the essential elements of the doctrine see pinter v dahl  us    s ct    l ed d   courts apply the defense where the plaintiff has participated in some of the same sort of wrongdoing as the defendant bateman eichler  us at   sct at  and should not allow the defense unless the degrees of fault are essentially indistinguishable or the plaintiffs responsibility is clearly greater pinter  us at   sct at  the second prong of the bateman eichler test instructs courts to consider the public policy implications of applying the defense  assuming shb committed a wrong peltzs responsibility for creating the margin call is clearly greater under the cea it is unlawful to attempt to manipulate or to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce see  usc § b as weingarten testified he and peltz arranged to short sell copper contracts and then depress the price of copper contracts to reap a profit the recorded telephone conversations between peltz and weingarten paint a clear picture of commodities price manipulation the district court did not err when it concluded that the peltzweingarten agreement was in violation of the cea peltzs conduct thus falls within first prong of the bateman eichler test his manipulation of the commodities market was far more reprehensible than shbs violation of the regulations promulgated under the cea  peltz seeks to evade the in pari delicto defense by noting that the wrongdoing of which he is accused ie manipulating markets is not the same wrongdoing he seeks to redress ie shbs clearing weingartens transactions through peltzs account without proper authorization in violation of  cfr §   peltzs hypertechnical interpretation of the in pari delicto doctrine is outdated at one time this court recognized that the in pari delicto defense was available only when the fault of the parties is clearly mutual simultaneous and relatively equal  mallis v bankers trust co  fd   n  d cir citation omitted and that mutuality of fault meant that the parties had to have a related purpose or act as confederates our limitation of the defense reflected the general tenor set by the supreme court in perma life mufflers inc v international parts corp  us   s ct   l ed d   modified copperweld corp v independence tube corp  us   s ct   l ed d   which we as many other courts saw as a signpost that the high court had little enthusiasm for the in pari delicto defense ross  fd at   that message changed somewhat however when the supreme court decided bateman eichler and we noted that change in tone when we decided ross v bolton id in ross the plaintiff agreed to purchase securities from re bolton  co inc bolton and resell the securities instantaneously at a higher agreed upon price id at  defendant bear stearns  co bear stearns acted as the clearing broker for the trades but there was no evidence that it knew of the prearranged scheme id at  when the plan did not work ross sued among others bear stearns alleging that bear stearns fraudulently misled the plaintiffs into believing that bolton was solvent id at   ross declared that if he had known boltons true financial condition he would not have involved himself in the scheme we held that because ross intentionally entered into the prearranged trade with bolton with its supposed guaranteed profit he rather than bear stearns must bear the responsibility for the risks of the transaction id at  the in pari delicto defense we concluded served as a complete bar to the plaintiffs suit against bear stearns  ross illustrates that we now recognize a broader notion of mutuality of fault and consequently how peltzs argument misses the mark the alleged wrong committed by bear stearns in ross misleading the plaintiff into believing that bolton was solvent was qualitatively different from the wrong in which ross participateda prearranged stock parking scheme yet that did not stop us from allowing bear stearns to bar rosss suit through the application of the in pari delicto defense so too although the alleged violation of the cea by shb in this case is of a different quality than the market manipulation in which peltz participated the lack of an identical nature does not destroy the defense we conclude therefore that the first prong of the bateman eichler test is satisfied  so too the second prong of the bateman eichler test is satisfied preclusion of peltzs suit will not significantly interfere with the effective enforcement of the laws and protection of the public au contraire allowing his suit would significantly interfere with the enforcement of statutes designed to protect the investing public assuming shb did violate the regulations promulgated under the cea we would overlook that ministerial wrong when to do otherwise would protect a market manipulator without any benefit to the public  accordingly both prongs of the bateman eichler test having been satisfied we hold that peltz cannot pursue his claims conclusion  we have considered all of peltzs other arguments and consider them to be without merit accordingly the judgment of the district court is affirmed  after oral argument the panel solicited the commodity futures trading commissions cftc understanding of  cfr §  the cftc filed a brief as a friend of the court and this panels views accord with the cftcs position microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must allow firstparty and

release docket  for release  june   cftc administrative law judge finds that solomon mayer committed fraud by bucketing customer orders on the nymex over a twoyear period fines totaling  levied in the case the initial decision stems from a count complaint filed by the cftc in  washington  the commodity futures trading commission cftc announced today that on may   the honorable george painter cftc administrative law judge alj entered an initial decision finding that solomon mayer violated the antifraud provisions of the commodity exchange act cea by bucketing customer orders on the new york mercantile exchange nymex over two years from  though  in the matter of solomon mayer et al cftc docket no  the alj found that solomon mayer and barry mayer violated the ceas trade practice provisions when they engaged in extensive noncompetitive trading on the nymex during the same period shb commodities inc a futures commission merchant and maye commodities corp were held liable for the mayers violative trading activity the alj found that steven gelbstein a nymex floor trader had accommodated solomon mayers indirect bucketing of customer orders in violation of the trade practice provisions of the cea furthermore the aljs order revoked the commodity registrations of solomon mayer barry mayer and shb and imposed a fiveyear commodity futures trading ban on each of them in addition the court assessed a civil monetary penalty in the amount of  on solomon mayer and a  civil monetary penalty each on barry mayer shb and maye commodities finally gelbstein is prohibited by the aljs order from trading for a period of  days and must pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of  each of the respondents is subject to a cease and desist order the matter arose from a count complaint filed by the cftc on april   see cftc news release  april   the cftc complaint alleged that the respondents violated the cea by among other things  bucketing customer orders and  engaging in noncompetitively executed wash sales and fictitious trades in reaching its decision the alj found that solomon mayer barry mayer and shb abused their market trading privileges by deliberately and repeatedly cheating and defrauding customers and impairing the integrity of the market the alj concluded that there was undoubtedly a nexus between the respondents wrongdoing and the integrity of the futures market  in the discussion the alj opined that dual trading which permits floor brokers to trade for their personal accounts as well as for customers mocks the notion of an open and competitive market and virtually invites the abuses charged and proven in the case at hand the alj also noted that the deliberate failure of solomon mayer barry mayer and gelbstein to retain their trading cards constitutes a significant audit trail irregularity from which adverse inferences could be drawn finding that the evidence presented failed to establish that isaac mayer acted in a capacity that required him to be registered with the cftc the alj dismissed the allegations in this regard against him the cftcs complaint charged isaac mayer with accepting customer orders on behalf of shb without being registered with the cftc among other things solomon mayer has been registered with the cftc as a floor broker since  barry mayer and halper have been registered as floor brokers since  gelbstein a member of the nymex was neither registered nor required to be registered with the cftc during the relevant time period shb is registered as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the nymex maye commodities was formerly a nymex clearing member
