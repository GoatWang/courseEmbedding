been prepared in accordance with the instructions to interim financial reporting as prescribed by the sec the yearend consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america “gaap”  the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this report include all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature that in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods certain prior period amounts in our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation these interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december    filed with the sec on february   which we refer to as our “form k” unless the context indicates otherwise throughout this report the terms “dynegy” “the company” “we” “us” “our” and “ours” are used to refer to dynegy inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries our current business operations are focused primarily on the unregulated power generation sector of the energy industry we report the results of our power generation business as three segments in our unaudited consolidated financial statements i the coal segment “coal” ii the iph segment “iph” and iii the gas segment “gas” our consolidated financial results also reflect corporatelevel expenses such as general and administrative expense interest expense and income tax benefit expense all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated please read note —segment information for further discussion iph and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are organized into ringfenced groups in order to maintain corporate separateness from dynegy and its other subsidiaries certain of the entities in the iph segment including illinois power generating company “genco” have an independent director whose consent is required for certain corporate actions including material transactions with affiliates further entities within the iph segment present themselves to the public as separate entities  they maintain separate books records and bank accounts and separately appoint officers  furthermore they pay liabilities from their own funds conduct business in their own names and have restrictions on pledging their assets for the benefit of certain other persons  these provisions restrict our ability to move cash out of these entities without meeting certain requirements as set forth in the governing documents genco’s  million senior notes are nonrecourse to dynegy note —accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect our reported financial position and results of operations based on currently available information  actual results could differ materially from our estimates the results of operations for the interim periods presented in this form q are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other interim period due to seasonal fluctuations in demand for our energy products and services changes in commodity prices timing of maintenance and other expenditures and other factors the accounting policies followed by the company are set forth in note —summary of significant accounting policies in our form k the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majorityowned or controlled subsidiaries accounting policies for all of our operations are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america there have been no significant changes to our accounting policies during the three months ended march    accounting standards adopted during the current period hybrid financial instruments in november  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” derivatives and hedging topic  determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity the amendments in this asu clarify how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share specifically the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation in evaluating the nature of the host contract furthermore the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract rather the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument the amendments in this asu also clarify that in evaluating the nature of a host contract an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features ie the relative strength of the debtlike or  dynegy inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited for the interim periods ended march   and  equitylike terms and features given the facts and circumstances when considering how to weight those terms and features the adoption of this asu on january   did not have an impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements debt issuance costs in april  the fasb issued asu interestimputation of interest subtopic   the amendments in this asu require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts  the recognition and measurement guidance for our debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update  in august  the fasb issued asu interestimputation of interest subtopic  the amendments in this asu further clarify the guidance provided in asu  to include the presentation of debt issuance costs in relation to lineofcredit arrangements the amendments state these costs may be presented as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement we adopted these asus on january   on a retrospective basis affecting presentation on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented consolidation in february  the fasb issued asu consolidation topic  the amendments in this asu respond to concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities in particular i consolidation of limited partnerships and similar legal entities ii evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest iii the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination iv the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination and v consolidation of certain investment funds the adoption of this asu on january   did not have an impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements extraordinary and unusual items in january  the fasb issued asu income statementextraordinary and unusual items subtopic  the amendments in this asu eliminate from gaap the concept of extraordinary items and will no longer require separate classification of these items within the statement of operations presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring the guidance in this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december    the adoption of this asu on january   did not have an impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements accounting standards not yet adopted compensation in march  the fasb issued asu compensationstock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the amendments in this asu simplify several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows the guidance in this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating this asu and any potential impacts the adoption of this asu will have on our unaudited consolidated financial statements debt instruments in march  the fasb issued asu derivative and hedging contingent put and call options in debt instruments the amendments in this asu clarify what steps are required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call put options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative an entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this asu is required to assess the embedded call put options solely in accordance with the fourstep decision sequence the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years all entities have the option of adopting the new requirements early including adoption in an interim period if an entity early adopts the new requirements in an interim period it must reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period we are currently assessing this asu however we do not anticipate the adoption of this asu will have a material impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements leases in february  the fasb issued asu leases topic  the amendments in this asu will mainly require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under gaap in their balance sheet the lease assets recognized in the balance sheet will represent a rightofuse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term the lease liability recognized in the balance sheet will represent the lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis the guidance in this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted we are currently

accounting for the acquisitions is not complete because certain information and analysis that may impact our initial valuation is still being obtained or reviewed dynegy expects to finalize these amounts during the second quarter of  the significant assets and liabilities for which provisional amounts are recognized at the respective acquisition dates are property plant and equipment “ppe” goodwill deferred income taxes and taxes other than deferred income taxes we continue to evaluate settlements which could relate to preacquisition activity from the isos additionally some taxes have not yet been finalized with the associated taxing jurisdictions resulting in a potential change to their fair value at acquisition these changes may also impact the fair value of the acquired ppe goodwill or deferred tax liability as such the provisional amounts recognized are subject to revision until our valuation is completed not to exceed one year and any material adjustments identified that existed as of the acquisition date will be recognized in the current period  dynegy inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited for the interim periods ended march   and  to fair value working capital we used available market information asset retirement obligations “aros” were recorded in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations to fair value the acquired ppe we used a discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis based upon a debtfree free cash flow model  the dcf model was created for each power generation facility based on its remaining useful life and included gross margin forecasts for each facility using forward commodity market prices obtained from third party quotations for the years  and   for the years  through  we used gross margin forecasts based upon commodity and capacity price curves developed internally using forward new york mercantile exchange natural gas prices and supply and demand factors  for periods beyond  we assumed a  percent growth rate we also used management’s forecasts of operations and maintenance expense general and administrative expense and capital expenditures for the years  through  and assumed a  percent growth rate based upon management’s view of future conditions thereafter the resulting cash flows were then discounted using plant specific discount rates of approximately  percent to  percent for gasfired generation facilities and approximately  percent to  percent for coalfired generation facilities based upon the asset’s age efficiency region and years until retirement contracts with terms that were not at current market prices were also valued using a dcf analysis  the cash flows generated by the contracts were compared with their cash flows based on current market prices with the resulting difference recorded as either an intangible asset or liability the  shares of common stock of dynegy issued as part of the consideration for the equipower acquisition were valued at

information indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  in addition we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is reasonably possible  in all instances management has assessed the matters below based on current information and made judgments concerning their potential outcome giving consideration to the nature of the claim the amount if any the nature of damages sought and the probability of success  management regularly reviews all new information with respect to such contingencies and adjusts its assessments and estimates of such contingencies accordingly  because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties including unfavorable rulings or developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of our legal proceedings could involve amounts that are different from our currently recorded accruals and that such differences could be material in addition to the matters discussed below we are party to other routine proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  any accruals or estimated losses related to these matters are not material in management’s judgment the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows gas index pricing litigation   we through our subsidiaries and other energy companies are

in may  three complaints were filed at ferc regarding the zone  results for the  planning resource auction “pra” conducted by miso dynegy is a named party in one of the complaints the complainants public citizen inc the illinois attorney general and southwestern electric cooperative inc have challenged the results of the pra as unjust and unreasonable requested rate reliefrefunds and requested changes to the miso pra structure going forward complainants have also alleged that dynegy may have engaged in economic or physical withholding in zone  constituting market manipulation in the  pra the independent market monitor for miso “miso imm” which was responsible for monitoring the miso  pra determined that all offers were competitive and that no physical or economic withholding occurred  the miso imm also stated in a filing responding to the complaints that there is no basis for the proposed remedies  we filed our answer to these complaints and believe that we complied fully with the terms of the miso tariff in connection with the  pra disputed the allegations and will defend our actions vigorously in addition the illinois industrial energy consumers filed a complaint at ferc against miso on june   requesting prospective changes to the miso tariff dynegy also responded to this complaint on october   ferc issued an order of nonpublic formal investigation stating that shortly after the conclusion of the  pra ferc’s office of enforcement began a nonpublic informal investigation into whether market manipulation or other potential violations of ferc orders rules and regulations occurred before or during the pra the “order” the order noted that the investigation is ongoing and that the order converting the informal nonpublic investigation to a formal nonpublic investigation does not indicate that ferc has determined that any entity has engaged in market manipulation or otherwise violated any ferc order rule or regulation further ferc held a staffled technical conference on october   to obtain further information concerning potential changes to the miso pra structure going forward including proposals made by complainants the technical conference did not address the ongoing office of enforcement investigation  dynegy inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited for the interim periods ended march   and  on december   ferc issued an order on the complaints requiring a number of prospective changes to the miso tariff provisions associated with calculating initial reference levels and local clearing requirements effective as of the  pra under the order ferc found that the existing tariff provision which bases initial reference levels for capacity supply offers on the estimated opportunity cost of exporting capacity to a neighboring region for example pjm are no longer just and reasonable accordingly ferc required miso to set the initial reference level for capacity at  per mwday for the  pra  capacity suppliers may also request a facilityspecific reference level from the miso imm the order did not address the arguments of the complainants regarding the  pra and stated that those issues remain under consideration and will be addressed in a future order new source review and caa matters new source review since  the epa has been engaged in a nationwide enforcement initiative to determine whether coalfired power plants failed to comply with the requirements of the new source review and new source performance standard provisions under the caa when the plants implemented modifications the epa’s initiative focuses on whether projects performed at power plants triggered various permitting requirements including the need to install pollution control equipment in august  the epa issued a notice of violation “nov” alleging that projects performed in   and  at the newton facility violated prevention of significant deterioration title v permitting and other requirements the nov remains unresolved we believe our defenses to the allegations described in the nov are meritorious a decision by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit in  held that similar claims older than five years were barred by the statute of limitations if not overturned this decision may provide an additional defense to the allegations in the newton facility nov wood river caa section  information request in  we received an information request from the epa concerning our wood river facility’s compliance with the illinois state implementation plan “sip” and associated permits we responded to the epa’s request and believe that there are no issues with wood river’s compliance but we are unable to predict the epa’s response if any we plan to retire our wood river facility on june   as approved by miso caa notices of violation in december  the epa issued an nov alleging violation of opacity standards at the zimmer facility which we coown and operate the epa previously had issued novs to zimmer in  and  alleging violations of the caa the ohio sip and the station’s air permits involving standards applicable to opacity sulfur dioxide sulfuric acid mist and heat input the novs remain unresolved in

groups filed a caa citizen suit in the us district court for the central district of illinois alleging violations of opacity and particulate matter limits at our iph segment’s edwards facility the district court has scheduled the trial date for october  we dispute the allegations and will defend the case vigorously ultimate resolution of any of these caa matters could have a material adverse impact on iph’s future financial condition results of operations and cash flows a resolution could result in increased capital expenditures for the installation of pollution control equipment increased operations and maintenance expenses and penalties at this time we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible costs or range of costs that might be incurred to resolve these matters stuart npdes permit appeal   in january  the ohio epa reissued the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit for the coowned stuart facility  the operator of stuart the dayton power and light company appealed various aspects of the permit including provisions regarding thermal discharge limitations to the ohio environmental review appeals commission  depending on the outcome of the appeal the effects on stuart’s operations could be material at this time we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible costs or range of costs that might be incurred to resolve this matter coal segment groundwater  in  the illinois epa issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards onsite at our baldwin and vermilion facilities at baldwin with approval of the illinois epa we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the baldwin coal combustion residuals “ccr” surface impoundment system beginning in  based on the results of that evaluation we recommended to the illinois epa in  that the closure process for the inactive east ccr surface impoundment begin and that a geotechnical investigation of the existing soil cap on the inactive old east ccr surface impoundment be undertaken we also submitted a supplemental groundwater modeling report that indicates no known offsite water supply wells will be impacted under the various baldwin ccr surface impoundment closure scenarios modeled in april  we submitted closure and postclosure care plans  dynegy inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited for the interim periods ended march   and  to the illinois epa for the baldwin old east east and west fly ash ccr surface impoundments we await illinois epa action on our plans we initiated an investigation at baldwin in  at the request of the illinois epa to determine if the facility’s ccr surface impoundment system impacts offsite groundwater results of the offsite groundwater quality investigation as submitted to the illinois epa in  indicate two localized areas where class i groundwater standards were exceeded based on the data and groundwater flows we do not believe that the exceedances are attributable to the baldwin ccr surface impoundment system at our retired vermilion facility which is not subject to the ccr rule we submitted proposed corrective action plans for two ccr surface impoundments ie the old east and the north ccr surface impoundments to the illinois epa in  our hydrogeologic investigation indicates that these two ccr surface impoundments impact groundwater quality onsite and that such groundwater migrates offsite to the north of the property and to the adjacent middle fork of the vermilion river  the proposed corrective action plans recommend closure in place of both ccr surface impoundments and include an application to the illinois epa to establish a groundwater management zone while impacts from the facility are mitigated  in  we submitted a revised corrective action plan for the old east ccr surface impoundment we await illinois epa action on our proposed corrective action plans in june  we advised the illinois epa that the additional analyses requested by the agency would be performed upon receipt of a riverbank stabilization permit from the us army corps of engineers our estimated cost of the recommended closure alternative for both the vermilion old east and north ccr surface impoundments including postclosure care is approximately  million  if remediation measures concerning groundwater are necessary in the future at either baldwin or vermilion we may incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the costs or range of costs of remediation if any that ultimately may be required iph segment groundwater groundwater monitoring results indicate that the ccr surface impoundments at each of the iph segment facilities potentially impact onsite groundwater in  the illinois epa issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards at the newton and coffeen facilities’ ccr surface impoundments in april  we submitted an assessment monitoring report to the illinois epa concerning previously reported groundwater quality standard exceedances at the newton facility’s active ccr landfill the report identifies the newton facility’s inactive unlined landfill as the likely source of the exceedances and recommends various measures to minimize the effects of that source on the groundwater monitoring results of the active landfill if remediation measures concerning groundwater are necessary at any of our iph facilities iph may incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations and cash flows at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the costs or range of costs of remediation if any that ultimately may be required      dam safety assessment reports in response to the failure at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston plant the epa initiated a nationwide investigation of the structural integrity of ccr surface impoundments in  the epa assessments found all of our surface impoundments to be in satisfactory or fair condition with the exception of the surface impoundments at the baldwin and hennepin facilities in response to the hennepin report we made capital improvements to the hennepin east ccr surface impoundment berms and notified the epa of our intent to close the hennepin west ccr surface impoundment the preliminary estimated cost for closure of the west ccr surface impoundment including postclosure monitoring is approximately  million  which is reflected in our aros we performed further studies needed to support closure of the west ccr surface impoundment submitted those studies to the illinois epa in  and await illinois epa action in response to the baldwin report we notified the epa in  of our action plan which included implementation of recommended operating practices and certain recommended studies in  we updated the epa on the status of our baldwin action plan including the completion of certain studies and implementation of remedial measures and our ongoing evaluation of potential longterm measures in the context of our concurrent evaluation at baldwin of groundwater corrective actions at this time to resolve the concerns raised in the epa’s assessment report and as a result of the ccr rule we plan to initiate closure of the baldwin west fly ash ccr surface impoundment in  which is reflected in our aros other commitments in conducting our operations we have routinely entered into longterm commodity purchase and sale commitments as well as agreements that commit future cash flow to the lease or acquisition of assets used in our businesses these commitments have been typically associated with commodity supply arrangements capital projects reservation charges associated with firm  dynegy inc notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited for the interim periods ended march   and  transmission transportation storage and leases for office space

technical service agreements asset sales agreements and procurement and construction contracts  some agreements contain indemnities that cover the other party’s negligence or limit the other party’s liability with respect to third party claims in which event we will effectively be indemnifying the other party  virtually all such agreements contain representations or warranties that are covered by indemnifications against the losses incurred by the other parties in the event such representations and warranties are false  while there is always the possibility of a loss related to such representations warranties indemnifications and guarantees in our contractual agreements and such loss could be significant in most cases management considers the probability of loss to be remote  we have accrued no amounts with respect to the indemnifications as of march   because none were probable of occurring nor could they be reasonably estimated delta transaction guarantees concurrently with

and   respectively income tax expense for the three months ended march   was primarily due to state income tax resulting from a change in our corporate tax structure as of march    we continued to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction as they arise as there was not sufficient evidence to overcome our historical cumulative losses to conclude that it is morelikelythannot our net deferred tax assets can be realized in the future please read note —income taxes for further discussion discussion of adjusted ebitda nongaap performance measures in analyzing and planning for our business we supplement our use of the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america “gaap” financial measures with nongaap financial measures including earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda these nongaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures included in the tables below may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business these nongaap financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures and are by definition an incomplete understanding of dynegy and must be considered in conjunction with gaap measures we believe that the historical nongaap measures disclosed in our filings are only useful as an additional tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about our financial and operating performance by definition nongaap measures do not give a full understanding of dynegy therefore to be truly valuable they must be used in conjunction with the comparable gaap measures in addition nongaap financial measures are not standardized therefore it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure ebitda and adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as earnings loss before interest expense income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization expense we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted to exclude i gains or losses on the sale of certain assets ii the impacts of marktomarket changes on derivatives related to our generation portfolio as well as interest rate swaps and warrants iii the impact of impairment charges and certain other costs such as those associated with acquisitions and iv other material items beginning in  adjusted ebitda also excludes noncash compensation expense noncash compensation expense of  million was not excluded during the three months ended   table of contents we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide meaningful representations of our operating performance we consider ebitda as another way to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis adjusted ebitda is meant to reflect the operating performance of our entire power generation fleet for the period presented consequently it excludes the impact of marktomarket accounting impairment charges and other items that could be considered “nonoperating” or “noncore” in nature because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are financial measures that management uses to allocate resources determine our ability to fund capital expenditures assess performance against our peers and evaluate overall financial performance we believe they provide useful information for our investors in addition many analysts fund managers and other stakeholders that communicate with us typically request our financial results in an ebitda and adjusted ebitda format as prescribed by the sec when ebitda or adjusted ebitda is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is net income loss management does not analyze interest expense and income taxes on a segment level therefore the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda or adjusted ebitda when performance is discussed on a segment level is operating income loss  adjusted ebitda

historically after pge’s gas transportation rate structure was changed to unbundle the backbone transmission system “bb” rates pge gas transmission and storage rate case settlements have included a bill credit for moss landing units  and  that effectively reduces the differential between rates for bb and local transmission system service allowing the plant to compete against other power

complied fully with the terms of the miso tariff in connection with the  pra in addition the illinois industrial energy consumers filed a complaint at ferc against miso on june   requesting prospective changes to the miso tariff on october   ferc issued an order of nonpublic formal investigation stating that shortly after the conclusion of the  pra ferc’s office of enforcement began a nonpublic informal investigation into whether market manipulation or other potential violations of ferc orders rules and regulations occurred before or during the pra the order noted that the investigation is ongoing and that the order converting the informal nonpublic investigation to a formal nonpublic investigation does not indicate that ferc has determined that any entity has engaged in market manipulation or otherwise violated any ferc order rule or regulation further ferc held a staffled technical conference on october   to obtain further information concerning potential changes to the miso pra structure going forward including proposals made by complainants the technical conference did not address the ongoing office of enforcement investigation on december   ferc issued an order on the complaints requiring a number of prospective changes to the miso tariff provisions associated with calculating initial reference levels and local clearing requirements effective as of the  pra under the order ferc found that the existing tariff provision which bases initial reference levels for capacity supply offers on the estimated opportunity cost of exporting capacity to a neighboring region for example pjm are no longer just and reasonable accordingly ferc required miso to set the initial reference level for capacity at  per mwday for the  pra  capacity suppliers may also request a facilityspecific reference level from the miso imm the order did not address the other arguments of the complainants regarding the  pra and stated that those issues remain under

conditions required by various regulatory authorities consummation of the delta transaction is subject to conditions and governmental approvals including approval from the ferc and the public utility commission of texas and the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the delta transaction under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements “hsr” act the closing of the delta transaction is also subject to the condition that there be no injunction or order issued by a governmental authority that restrains enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the delta stock purchase agreement the waiting period applicable to the delta transaction under the hsr act has been terminated but we can provide no assurance that all other required regulatory approvals will be obtained there can also be no assurance as to the cost scope or impact of the actions that may be required to obtain the required regulatory approvals furthermore these actions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the delta transaction or imposing additional costs conditions or restrictions on our business and operations some of which could be material and adversely affect our revenues and profitability following the consummation of the transaction furthermore the ferc the public utility commission of texas the department of justice or other governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the delta transaction as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest at any time including after completion of the transaction in addition in some circumstances a competitor customer or other third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the delta transaction before or after it is consummated we may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws if the delta transaction is consummated we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of the assets with our existing operations or to realize targeted cost savings revenues and other anticipated benefits of the transaction the success of the delta transaction will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from integrating gsena’s assets with our existing generation business to realize these anticipated benefits the businesses must be successfully combined we may be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain integrate improve or sustain the assets’ operations or take unexpected writeoffs or impairment charges resulting from the transaction further we may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the assets if any of these factors occur or limit our ability to integrate the businesses successfully or on a timely basis the expectations of our future financial conditions and results of operations following the transaction might not be met in addition we and gsena have operated and until the consummation of the transaction will continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards controls information technology systems procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction and could harm our financial performance further we may be required to implement or improve the internal controls procedures and policies of the assets to meet standards applicable to us public companies which may be timeconsuming and more expensive than anticipated in addition we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from and the fair value accounting allocations associated with the delta transaction and refine them accordingly actual costsavings the costs required to realize the costsavings and the source of the costsavings could differ materially from our estimates and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of costsavings on the schedule anticipated or at all finally we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the delta transaction if the combined businesses are not able to achieve our objectives or are not able to achieve our objectives on a timely basis the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the  table of contents anticipated benefits of the transaction as well as any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the delta transaction we expect to incur significant costs associated with the delta transaction and combining the operations of our company with gsena including costs to achieve targeted costsavings the substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the transaction will be composed of transaction costs systems consolidation costs and business integration and employmentrelated costs including costs for severance retention and other restructuring we may also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and the gsena businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all failure to consummate the delta transaction could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and cause us to incur significant costs that could materially impact our financial performance results of operations or financial condition there can be no assurance that the delta transaction will be consummated failure to consummate the delta transaction may negatively impact the future trading price of our common stock and if the delta transaction is not consummated the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a market assumption that there is a high probability that the delta transaction will be consummated in addition if the delta stock purchase agreement is terminated under certain circumstances the delta stock purchase agreement requires the purchaser to pay gsena a fee of  million of which we would be obligated to fund  million payment of such termination fee could materially and adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition the announcement and pendency of the acquisitions could impact or cause disruptions in our and gsena’s operations the announcement and pendency of the delta transaction could impact or cause disruptions in our and gsena’s operations specifically • our and gsena’s current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the transaction including with respect to current or future business relationships with us and gsena or the combined company business and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business • our and gsena’s employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us which may adversely affect our and gsena’s ability to retain and hire key employees and • the transaction may give rise to potential liabilities including potential stockholder lawsuits relating to the transaction any of the above disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if the delta transaction is consummated we will conduct a portion of our operations through a joint venture which will subject these operations to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on their success and on our financial position and results of operations if the delta transaction is consummated we will conduct a portion of our operations through atlas power a joint venture with the ecp funds the atlas power joint venture arrangement may present financial managerial and operational challenges including potential disputes liabilities and contingencies and may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly including for example • our joint venture partner may have business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals • our joint venture partner shares certain approval rights over major decisions • we may be unable in certain circumstances to control the amount of cash we will receive from atlas power • we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by atlas power or our joint venture partner • we may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to atlas power and • disputes between us and our joint venture partner may result in delays litigation or operational impasses the challenges and risks described above could adversely affect atlas power’s ability to transact its business which would in turn negatively affect atlas power’s financial condition results of operations and distributable cash flows any such negative effects could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  table of contents if the delta transaction is consummated atlas power will be financed primarily through nonrecourse project finance debt if atlas power defaults on its obligations under such nonrecourse debt we may decide to make certain payments to the relevant debt holders to prevent foreclosure which would without such payments cause us to lose our ownership interest in atlas power or in some or all of its power generation facilities if the delta transaction is consummated atlas power will be financed primarily through nonrecourse project finance debt nonrecourse project finance debt refers to financing arrangements that are repaid solely from the project’s revenues and are secured by the project’s physical assets major contracts cash accounts and in many cases the project owners’ ownership interests in the project if atlas power defaults on its obligations under its nonrecourse financing agreements we may decide to make payments to prevent the debt holders from foreclosing on atlas power’s collateral such a foreclosure would result in our losing our ownership interests or in some or all of its power generation facilities the loss of our ownership interests or some or all of its assets or our decision to make payments to lenders to avoid any such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if the pipe
